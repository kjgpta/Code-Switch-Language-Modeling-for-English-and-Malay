apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K
so lepas
we all have to uh macam go back to you know to kasi balik the coins
but then again you did what during uh bulan puasa
ah it's damn hot then you thirsty then you want to makan right

basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit

so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially

I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad lah but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam eh
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau
no I think pasal dia dia daripada kaku dia macam kaku but the my mum was very impressed that dia menonton filem tanggang eh dari awal hingga akhir so I said what's happening you know
anak going
tapi tapi dia suka dia suka tengok my computer ah
okay kita punya ni nak tamat sayang
but she also get shares which I am I think she her limit is three to four hours after that she like okay don't need computer pun takpe ah she has this limit ah
I think in really should learn I know kata takpe sekarang ni tengah tengah waktu akhir dah dah peperiksaan dah berakhir pun masih masih nak belajar I said no lah no nothing belajar I said this is like membaca buku

today eh today lah kan si kakak ajak keluar hari ni dia kata tak nak
eh then si affaf macam mana sekolah dia tu
sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there
kalau kata recognise that's a plus point lah kan I mean singapore to malaysia tu wah one more year
tapi tak ada uni photography eh ada ke
cari apa tu lah you you you sign up with uh intern at Sony
uh ya yang yang yang resale ah resale of
post apa post recruit people
anak tiga tu eh
is it matters if you plot english and english and maths lain english lain
uh uh you I think tak payah you can just put a survey K put a survey
ah now SAM ada new uh so called syllabus come out for english
are you if you are offered are you interested to be uh enrolling your son ke gitu lah kan
from there then you see kalau ratio dia only about ten percent
tengok uh I don't know how you I mean you can limit to one class lah kan
kalau ramai orang healthy response then you can consider open kalau tak healthy then
better ya cause we don't want need to to be up to student the student then one teacher I mean you buat habiskan duit on that
no I didn't do anything tak ada your one
I tak buat apa-apa
dia suspend
suspend jap
so what you saying is what oh ya english if both english uh she can ajar english dengan melayu eh english dengan melayu
english and maths then is much better lah then for si apa tu si
the tutor tak jadi eh no no the uh chinese boy is one thing lah kan this thursday jumpa you kan si yang yang keng kok
eh so post post ke
or no partnership you can say lah is difficult administration susah I either want to
nanti at the end kita bergaduh susah safe
then you can you can say lah now pun dah fifty students
mm first day dia datang just take it okay
and some of it with the P two lah kalau dia ingat
apa tu all all the progress report
then you going to apa tu send it through WhatsApp lah kan
I cakap it can be WhatsApp eh I say to you ah that day
no the thing is parents kalau
ah cannot cannot can't be bothered tak semua turun can count
the children tak kasi
then apa tu that day oh ya I dah bayar stamp fee
kena bayar lagi another six months
supposedly you know lah we aim to for for yang to take over kan sekarang kita ada but I will see if after six months he
dia tak payah become funder ah because macam
okay I fund you okay you run tak gitu lah you must be committed
apa yang tu I mean we can change lah apa yang
tapi I
kita nak dia to be a chinese kan kalau dia is a eurasian
ada patient tak ah we're going to wait for what what what
but if the children going tak tahu juga seh
then then you ask him about you are staying juga eh ah about journey travel
dia tak is his ah
dia graduate ke apa
kalau kan dia ni main intern teaching long time lah dia mengajar
just now you say I'm just from something is it his uh secondary school kat mana
itu jer bahasa melayu yang awak tahu
so now he kerja part time part time ni lah full time lah
okay lah dia dah tanya you tak tahu kalau dia
but eh ya lah but the thing is kalau he is okay I willing to do these two hours first kan
his is dia punya rezeki dia lah kan if you don't want to be
in situation yang menyusahkan oh okay nak terus okay jer
but the thing is uh dia dah approach lah whether he is the type yang I tengok dia badan besar
kalau dia is the funny guy apa macam you know he can uh communicate with the kids ya first he's a guy kan
kids semua suka girls ladies
gitu ah if this guy is that one that uh can communicate uh friendly then he's it lah kan
we might just uh end of the contract lah kan macam tu lah
cause the the you can see the sepatutnya apa
apa uh expose the student yang you have to serve the six month ah and you want to have that
nisa next year tak tahu cerita
uh apa eh
uh econs ah ya and it was like so difficult but we were on a zoom with like seven other students then we all buat the test together
we just macam one student apa tu one student screen share dia punya screen like when he was when he while he was doing the the quiz ah
we all help him lah do the quiz then after that then we all collate the answer abeh kita submit

ya abeh rumah dia
my friend's house tadi
rumah dia macam sejuk ah then I was like sneezing
abeh but if she off macam panas
the kipas not strong enough
ya and then we just ya we just had lunch abeh supposed to uh apa buat our assignment ah then she like uh penat ah
ya then I was like eh I come to your house then her parents balik her parents balik uh apa dining cause we were studying at the dining table
then the was beside the dining table and macam their sofas and everything ah right
then parents dia okay I eat dinner ah abeh just on switch on the then we are like trying to study
I think but she wasn't even doing work so it didn't bother her lah and I also think macam she
dah biasa ya and she like couldn't tell that it was like affecting me cause like maybe it does
don't want ah so rude ya some more rumah dia like I don't want to say
uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya
no but uh dia nak lepak that's why ya
then where macam like kat rumah kau ada tempat makan
but ya your place macam takde tempat like makan right
oh kopitiam macam masih ada apa
kat like your area
oh oh takde macam mama mama shop gitu eh oh
then besok kau buat apa
eh lah kau buat
oh wait so it's macam ah grab oh
ya but I think aku macam now that I'm schooling tak payah kerja ah
because susah apa
penat and also I'm not doing well in school
it's not I punya tak tahu jaga masa ah ya
not continue but like macam
aku rasa macam like everyone
macam lepak kat rumah all then so you don't feel guilty that you are doing the same
I don't know kemas rumah serious macam every single day I just like kemas rumah
like macam satu dua hari abeh macam last
no lah but now aku try ah macam exercise
no because macam okay that time I remember I was like
ya then my like my muka breakout seh macam
ya my muka breakout then also macam
ya right tadi you keluar
macam that's important
um ya nak besok
start sekolah
start oh tak
kan ikut time macam ya
dia orang ikut ah dia orang punya punya
I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league
oh wait so now takde match ah
ya I just I just perasan
ada lah
ya of course ada
abeh kau menang eh babe sorry what
oh yang kau uh
tepi jalan kan
as in like they abeh ada satu pakcik tolong kau right ya
oh abeh kau lambat
tak I don't think so I think that's memang and it makes sense ya
park the bus lagi
oh okay kesiannya
oh sedihnya
tak nak join ah
takpe lah
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada penang tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so err what happened was my they fell in love I don't know how maybe under a tree then after that err datuk arwah datuk aku
yes so err that's the maternal side um my mum's father lah so err arwah datuk aku tu
dia I think he was from thailand also
okay I'm not sure oh no he's from like like descendants of india or something like that lah gedebak gedebuk then after that err they fell in love
under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke penang for them to get married
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
wow that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids lah tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves wow what a woman wow so this is your grand aunty right
memang banyak ah they have like you know like banyak
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa
then after that err duduk dekat err barrack police err together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather ah so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my err my mak aku dengan bapak aku
match is it how you is that how you say it matchmake ke apa
matchmake melayu cakap apa eh kalau matchmake melayu cakap apa
kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try lah kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay um so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin err then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know

tak lah tak tak tak kita pergi kat Al-Ameen woodlands
memang nak jumpa dia ah uh uh so actually it was supposed to be earlier but then bapa dia tak kasi like the bapa don't let the mum go out so then only on friday then the bapa let then okay alhamdulillah then I nervous like heck sia
uh so mak dia jer tahu uh uh
sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like kalau tahu tahu lah
ya sama
mm mm so far takde alhamdulillah like also because right
so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan
tak tahu bila lah but some day inshallah
ya lah ya lah ya lah tak ada minat kan
ya sebab sekolah lama seh like you you school like continuously right
mm the macam the momentum kan
so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh
ya exactly and then then during your wedding already people like oh your wedding going to be besar ain punya nanti besar-besar tau then I'm like siapa cakap siapa cakap a'ah I'm like excuse me
exactly eh suka hati jer main cakap jer
uh uh malangnya
mm maybe not necessarily lah my perfect wedding will be dekat kampung ah makan ulam-ulam semua
maybe kampung kat buangkok ke
ada yang satu dekat buangkok ah pulau ubin ke mana tahu weh kan best
ya I know habis pulau semakau pulau tekong
ya but I would I would rather have like a wedding at pulau ubin eh like siapa tak nak pergi pulau ubin okay tidak dijemput bagus filter filter
a'ah ah bukan tak jemput tapi korang tak nak datang betul tak betul ah bagus
ya ya it's okay ah this one macam plus minus lah mm mm
ya I mean I've seen people get married at tuas so I'm like siapa nak pergi tuas
ya so bagus ah siapa takde motor tak boleh datang
a'ah bagus tidak dijemput
uh uh uh uh dia dia saja jer
ke hujung eh
kirim salam sampaikan salam nak kasi duit PayNow takpe
uh uh zaman sekarang semua dah PayNow
but ya it like sebab kalau drive dari luar kan nampak dia punya
nama dia seafood restaurant so I don't know whether they like the building is owned by the seafood restaurant or like they do it at the seafood restaurant itself ya
sentosa mahal
go harbourfront go batam terus
feels like that eh rasa macam gitu ya it's like because
dari sentosa kan I always see all this ferry go to batam kalau lah boleh naik satu feri tu kan bagus
best juga tu
mm best apa
habis wallet
tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
mm mm ya like jangan nak janji melayu eh janji melayu kapal dah jalan eh please eh
ah lepas tu orang lepas tu kalau makcik makcik semua dah lambat habis semua orang muda dekat terus kan habis clubbing terus
tu bachelorette party seh all out seh
uh mocktail ada mocktail ada ya
ya it's a rooftop bar very nice ya me and adik went
you should I mean it's not cheap lah but like ya mm mm it's just strange because it feels like a nice place to for a date but I came with my brother instead so I'm like mm okay ya I went with adik
ya because right we wanted to get the very nice looking drinks and you know macam instagrammable gitu ah but then when we went
it was a like a brunch punya promotion I think uh brunch menu so it was like a buffet instead so I'm like okay lah
free flow macam barbecue then there's also free flow like telur nak omelette ke scrambled egg ke apa burger uh it's very nice but the I remember like everything was nice you know the
pasta you can choose your sauce chilli crab ke nak aglio olio ke apa uh then
uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
it's a mood it's a mood dia tinggal dekat uh
oh itu jauh babe jauhnya ya allah
and then yes nak try sangat ah try dua-dua sekali lah
why not and so entah macam dah try dua dua dah cukup ah
dah dan rasa okay lah dah dah puas then I I
um cari jodoh cari jodoh who is next
I was like please please kakak you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
no no no no no no sabar sabar no no okay so the the um
I downloaded for her Muzmatch kan can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her tau like macam
gambar nama jer like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that um
err upload lepas like bila-bila masa ah
tak payah terus upload
yes ya you try you can just try now after that lepas tu like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone lor then macam the account is still there there's something about you what
kalau let's say you nak nampak more calon kan
he was cute he was cute tapi kan
orang-orang kat sana kan is really looking for
in dia punya database include international people
macam like
yes what what is that yes tapi kena bayar
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch tak payah
like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking
sebab you duduk side by side
jangan date orang gatal
okay ya I agree with you pasal the movie like
kalau tengok movie tak boleh berbual and then you
buang masa like if it's a date like like first date you know that you buang masa like dua jam tak berbual then like
if you going out to makan and everything
uh no I feel like trekking nanti um
macam very superficial ya first ideal date ah I feel like
and then like dia orang masak sendiri you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like oh ya it's so cute
the mat tikar flat lay yes yes yes yes
ya so macam if you think like those cerita like or like I don't know like macam
but what if like the guy betul-betul macam very disgusting very rude
um so I I suddenly remember pasal you did you watch the smart local ya
by um catfish K catfish tu bukan kucing ikan okay tapi so basically like
ya do you watch like the netflix punya ha what's the
and then they will have like conversations bukan bukan it's not a cerita it's like dating reality
sekejap eh
many couples right only two got married tak salah I
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates dia orang dah beli you know
so it was about this article about this um malay muslim lady who decided to make halal mooncakes because
there are a lot of halal mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
dia orang tak sedar diri oh my god
then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk
it's uh uh oh my god when I read it I was like K lah buang masa jer lah I baca tak ada apa-apa it's okay thank you very much
so kesimpulannya
awak a'ah yang

the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just

should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal

miscarriage and then dia punya
teman lelaki tengah nangis on the bed dan macam dia tengah comfort teman lelaki dia I think

she very lawa
she I beli her using my own money you know my own duit my hati my buah hati my baby boo tak payah lelaki dah just you got a new laptop life's great baby
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu lah
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I don't know about you ah but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and salam dia punya mak lah cause like I don't know why
then I have to salam the mum then
I salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
err kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
huh sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and I was just confused you know I was just like
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo
the ice blend and I'm just like alamak makcik like I know lah like
or chocolate oreo like you the melayu the makcik be like
I mean KOI punya milk tea already nice
huh why you talking about milk tea and I want sushi so bad like girl girl nak sushi tapi girl girl tak ada duit
why is sushi expensive like why like kenapa
like they come dengan beras
mahal lah but like
nya sushi
shit lah like the sushi at eh not Sushi Express what is it ah dulu at junction eight ada
oh yeah talking about your madrasah
at the start I went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
masjid Ahmad Ibrahim
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
ya I almost said mertua this is why I cannot be nobody's menantu when I cannot even say menantu correctly
a'ah sia I cannot believe it that I actually took higher Malay sekarang melayu berterabur
berterabur baby berterabur
boy dia
mana lah aku tahu
like you nak datang rumah I ke tak you datang lah Mai</P2 lah is it
sampai macam gitu sekali ah like nak kena pakai voice note and all
cepatnya dia punya story travel
asal dia tak happy jer ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like
wah shit sia I'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang sia I'm just like so tilted
motor be like on the road malam malam buta baby who you fetching is it me I pun nak ikut
but really though naik motor is really fun like it's actually really fun
like the last time I naik motor was this guy who fetch me from work
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay

aku tak tahu ah
asal cause is just sem two start
game apa seh like icebreaker semua
korang berbual pasal apa seh
chey kau
okay okay faham faham
lapar seh
tak ah actually nak buat kerja ah like I have um I have assignment due tuesday
ya then kena watch some movies
like there are some macam theories and all that thing cause like up kan is about kau pernah tengok up
ah okay okay dia ada rumah ada rumah
oh yang yang that time tu dia kata ah socially constructed
apa ah what was it ah
macam make you make you wow gitu ah
asal asal still kena cause kau jiwa melayu apa
okay like in the future I kau
tapi like um
ah kalau macam like
um mix ah apa mixed racial marriages gitu kan then anak anak dorang semua mixed like muka campur gitu ah then
ya lah then it will never never end what gitu
apa sia lapan bangsa from where
like you are only from your mum and dad pe tak kan like you want to kira your nenek moyang semua
tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not
then I know like you have to jual to like
uh it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes
um like I want the windows to be like top down kind ah macam macam gini ah and also I want a balcony that can look outside like can sit outside kind
then like malam malam boleh just
ada some ada some
kat mana seh
tak oh kau nya west
oh dia macam this kind this kind of windows
oh itu masionette lah
yishun pun ada
dia macam loft
gitu eh
eh kau parents ah apa tu parents okay you can like how do you access the second floor
from the living room kat bawah like level one
not nice kecil eh
studio apa
oh macam malas eh
okay faham faham
ada those kinds ah but I don't think ada lah so but priority is just like um balcony ada balcony and like with a nice view and like not the kind yang macam kau tengok luar is then is the the
skyscrapers all those right it's like kau tengok luar lepastu
ah not laut lah but more of
um like pokok pokok also
then like it's like the balcony not macam balcony boleh letak kerusi
but I don't think ada but um private private housing also ada
asal takut eh takut hantu
oh okay ada pe playground kat macam serangoon gardens semua ada playground apa

but but the sekadar harapan too is
macam kau
ya lepastu like the main character say
asal kau kau nak buat on cahaya ah
oh okay aku I understand you
so just as long as kau boleh like your work makes sense
err cause sekarang we don't have any submission seh
ya I know I know ya that one kena bayar
I don't know but not I pay ah as in it's punya duit but then
it's as in not not the one yang tu it's the um head and vice head
yang deal with that
okay that's another thing oh cause sekarang oh fak aku suka I'm I'm
supposed to like freaking email cikgu cikgu ni seh
poly semua
but pukul tujuh seh pukul tujuh is like and it's friday so will it be rude
but I send seven nanti like tak cantik seh
ten lagi merepek
it's like orang nak orang nak tidur
tak lah just do ah
kau buat ah
if kau if you read um the cerpen yang eh um cerpen sahabat
it's about eh dia punya main character nama dia irfan seh
ya and it's a it's very like easy to baca and
easy easy to faham huh it's not love story ah it's like a sahabat
ya kau dah baca ah tu
err finish my practicum yay um I think semalam
cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
which one oh dia
I only eat waffle but then I'm so full babe what what do I have to do oh topik topik perbincangan
sekiranya anda

bye bye I'm just so patty and then kau kena cakap
and aku campak
kau kena macam nadira macam sasuke like how naruto call sasuke
bodoh lah
ya ya ya because literally kau boleh macam gini
alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana
cannot travel maknanya dia orang
kalau okay let's say macam for example eh kalau nak pergi ah okay ah cannot means the custom cannot clear them
nak kena macam uh in in a advance ah inform them in advance kind of thing ah
asal eh
tapi if you will just the duit bunga kan dia orang panggil duit bunga eh but you you still accumulate apa
correct twenty four per cent dia orang ambil kan they call it apa ah
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this
no because because when when I made the order dorang they asked for the ya lah they asked for your options like what do you want
okay ya so the cake is now the chocolate orange cake with Nutella kan ya then the macaron my mum biar dia choose lah cause different different colour let her choose ah but she cause she
ya the colour is the flavour so dia ada different different flavour lah so but my mum choose like the colours that are ah but the the taste the taste is not that different lah for macaron manis jer dia punya taste a bit a bit jer
tak dia maximum three flavours ya so so the bottom two the bottom two tier is one flavour the second two tier is one flavour the one two tier is one
mm tak
I ah cari-cari lah kat instagram
ya I read all the reviews apparently all the reviews say the macarons are good so I try the macaron I tak tahu that's that's the thing that's why I rather take the macarons cause the reviews a lot on macarons
nak order order birthday cake first ah
ya but then but I already pay deposit lah so whatever lah kita tawakkal jer
ya cake is the ya I think the remaining I just need to find out dia ada minta macam I think they ask for two hours time frame the that one I don't understand lah I ask uh don't know they haven't reply ah whatever ah nanti ah tapi that the cake is still a long time pe the day on the wedding baru dapat pe
I don't know I just cause their phrasing for that question is like very weird so I was like what do you mean by this tapi dorang belum reply so nanti ah just wait for them to reply
ya she want to ya she want to tambah-tambah lah
ya so biar lah biar lah dia mak pengantin
ya but he didn't ask tak I I called him actually I I wanted to ask about the package cause I need to order the wedding cake ya I I want to

ya lah I know I know tapi tak nak the thing is ya we want our guests lah it's just it's just my dad's issue thing lah yang dia nak more seats hais
ya but the thing is they won't get to eat because the food is specifically for fifty pax ya so kalau dorang actually for crew they won't get to eat
that's the thing so tak kan nak kasi macam kawan kita datang abeh dorang tak dapat makan seh it's not a buffet get it that's the part that they're not they don't understand
yang yes fine I can put them as crew macam like so that you get more seats but they won't get to eat lah because they are not itu pe a'ah the food is only fifty pax what
hais so tu lah a'ah I just ignore abeh after that dia tak tanya she didn't ask me but dia tak tanya macam directly after that bila dia delete like she didn't ask me my mum ah

dia menggigil nanti mata kelip-kelip mata dia err err err err aku tak tahu ah err aku tak tahu ah apa nak cakap

actually awak kalau nak you can come from the hotel also lah
entah but the this is kita belum halal nanti kalau orang tengok awak tengok saya macam tak pakai tudung macam weird

ya then you meet me at the hotel baru kita datang sama-sama lah I mean ya I mean we will just gonna I don't know ya the thing is because dia cakap we have from seven to ten abeh dia cakap kalau bridal use the room but we also don't have much time before that what
mm not enough time lah nak makeup
ya ya biar lah I don't think nak kena tanya mak andam juga ni like like will you follow me uh to the venue or tak ya cause kalau tak dia buat kat rumah then lepas tu dia jalan pe
pak andam usually is your brides man what eh brides man groomsman
alah kalau gitu rizal tahu lah
a'ah rizal dengan syam rizal dengan syam semua buatkan hafiz pe
actually syam syam yang bagus benda gini syam yang bagus
syafiq tak tahu ke
actually saya tahu tapi tak kan saya nak ikat awak
ikat pun boleh ikat sendiri pe
tapi saya saya pun tahu dulu malay dance pun kita belajar benda ni semua cause kita pun pakai apa a'ah kita pun pakai samping pe kan ah malay dance pun kadang-kadang our costumes we have to wear the samping kita semua belajar pe buat flower and all that I was talking just ask the person to teach lah but it will be weird lah kalau bride ikatkan samping
but the thing is if the thing is kan when mak if mak andam is there dia boleh siapkan awak juga pe if you come to the hotel room
tapi mak andam nak siap lelaki I don't know
ee tak payah lah
I think ya I think it's part of the package awak pun nak kena is it awak kena tiga kan
tengok lah tengok my mum suruh
takpe I tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah lah ah okay lah ah kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap eh kau merepek pakai lah inai ah then tu makna terpaksa
tak perlu lah hafiz pun tak pakai
and lepas tu ada lain benda ah ah pasal yang food serving
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama fifteen minute twenty minute
mm tak ah ambil gambar jer lah abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa bismillah gitu
okay lah so so fine eight thirty nanti uh the thing is actually kita dah short of time tau
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan ah
sekejap ah like the last ah last last eh we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah eh
ah okay okay so okay so awak take note err for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve jer because it's gonna be on the table jer kan
ya so so just eight thirty a'ah macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving lah like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak lah
tak kesah lah kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why I say ya we'll go by table that's why I say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask rizal to okay um now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures eh like each person ah
ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya ah itu okay tak lah on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh siti siti siti bagus siti kan baker
ah tu yang nanti siti nanti suruh siti tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty lah tak kan kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan a'ah lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan
shouldn't be lah kalau pergi table by table should be tak terlepas ah
I think so confirm rizal sabo nya dia mesti sabo punya like uh korang ada apa words to each other oh okay we both have a few words conjointly rizal kau irritating okay dah dah siap eh okay then something else I want to ask lah something else I wanted to ask the venue but I forgot ya lah yang pasal deejay tu are they giving cause dia cakap remember yang pasal spotify cakap just give us and then we will play it for you
oh ya okay okay so so can kita lupa pula nak tanya pasal tu sound board ah you tanya dia like who is is someone manning the sound board supposed to be from our side or you want your person to jaga your sound board
ya so so just ask him kalau tak takpe I just standby hafiz hafiz nanti kau pergi
wait eh nanti nanti ya it's just fade down fade up actually kalau rizal boleh buat pun rizal boleh buat sendiri jer bila dia nak berbual just fade down sendiri lepas tu dia berbual bila dia dah habis dia off mic lepas tu dia pergi ah lepas tu dia pergi balik to the sound board to just ah macam fade up lagu sikit ke ya atau actually awak boleh set kan on the board auto fade down
a'ah then awak buat itu jer tapi nanti dorang tak kasi eh kalau tukar setting nampak macam yang kecil punya macam yang
it was at the corner it looks like the you know the normal typical Yamaha yang kecil looks looks like it ah but I don't know I didn't see properly

tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature
tak but ya siapa yang jaga is it our people or his people
ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri

iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
okay then nak bual pasal apa
apa what's the last one
for the rest oh my god it's so lame you nak makan apa
and dia kata apa he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
then he was like ya nasi ayam
entah lah
speaking of makanan
so it's like a shape of a sotong
you tengok you tengok you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
kejap eh
eh it's delicious sedap
but is the shape of sotong
sedap kan so that is mala this is the most spiciest one
so the tak pedas sangat like
ada rasa macam dia then then dia tak macam meresap or like or like lama-lama macam tu
sedap kan sedap kan
so um I google and then youtube this thing cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana um basically they open like four five packets
dekat dalam mangkuk and then apa
sedap kan
they will accept this conversation at us kunyah-kunyah makan-makan
but you see the shape of the sotong is actually it looks legit macam sotong
oh my bad jangan kena baju
it will really stain tadi tadi you drop on my kasut
then don't bother makan dia punya oil
macam apa what's that word eh macam
randomly ah my friend dia cakap mm
I don't know how he came up with this stupid scenario dia cakap kalau macam uh what if you
scenario but dia kata
something like macam if this guy bump into you

meaning like unlimited spending dekat dalam itu ada macam a billion dollars he say you can do whatever you want with it lah
he let you spend use the card for one hour what would you do with the duit

when I tengah tidur malam-malam nanti I will burp then like it will get stuck in my throat
I tutup lampu I macam panas siol see told you you're thirsty already right

mister soput itu nak kena sebat
so it's like wah ini kalau ada uh ya can always teman what like someone to talk to
instead of seorang seorang
ya exactly then it's going to be perap in this whole room
considerable amount of space to joget-joget
move around lah at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like bersepahkan
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything semua sekarang tengah mahal I don't know ah like
I have no idea okay lah probably yes I have an idea what is is mahal now because
panasnya ya allah
then that that that's the thing price should be kurang apa should be lesser what
and nak itu pasang apa
and then have to pasang another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
the outside of the house was like rimas
then after that bersepah lagi then rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows ah tingkap macam best
kan mahal
you fikir masak-masak dulu like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like fikir masak-masak dulu like if you move in
kenapa mama nak pergi kranji suddenly
okay then cause suddenly she message me out of the blue kata nak pergi kranji tak three day two night then I was like wait what was I doing just that time ah I was like I think I was settling my mum's you know then like super busy lah then suddenly dapat message tu abeh I macam eh apasal suddenly but she didn't tell taufik at all
ah so yesterday I told taufik like eh my mum got message you or not that she wants to do all these thing then taufik was like just shaking his head so she haven't discuss like what why she want to go bila nak pergi mama tak ada bilang ah
itu dekat dengan jalan rasuk eh
so entah lah so let's just wait until mama like reply whether is it like a go ahead or not I mean if she wants to go to sentosa capella I don't mind lah cause you can use the hundred dollars voucher for that what then this one suddenly I'm like cam mana nak kata no
ya lor the the the new park royal is also err halal ya ya ya my sis is going I think in december my both my sis my sis-in-law they are bringing all the budak-budak kecil ah ada some glamping for kids inside the hotel rooms ya
ya then you can use the hundred dollars the rediscover voucher also but this morning I was like looking at the list lah didn't see the kranji one but I saw ada ada apa eh oh I saw got capella then capella you have the spa inside the room
then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila
ya lah then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation dulu
you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery

oh then ibu then ibu you give ibu
because it's unhealthy punya way of losing weight lah you probably lost weight because you didn't have proper meals or what
mm even when countries macam like uh mana eh
I think I think like macam taiwan or or australia or what no australia I had a lot of good food

ibu patutlah patutlah you very skinny
but is he matrep no right
like old matrep eh
then now my eyes pedih because of that nevermind I'm used to it
macam when I was at gold coast right
then I just macam even though I was alone
but macam to go to the shopping or outlets all right macam kena naik tram then I will go alone
no I I didn't like macam I didn't do that but
I think some of my ex colleagues did that but dekat
colour lain colour
some of them or even yang lagi gila right I've seen right those yang pergi athens flight
habis lepas tu tak salah is three or four nights there layover then they will go to santorini
tak penat ke kan
tak ah I think it's not ah
eh terkeluar eh babi
no lah later if my eye berair all
ya can make your bulu ketiak straight also
sterilise ah kononnya
you know malaysians have this malaysians have like some cream treatment like macam they inject shit into their face
so macam a bit hypocrite
I baru makan tiga hari
masih ada it's still selling at baraqah
but I don't feel like macam I just wanted to try this first
ya Odella made me lose weight because I shit a lot I shit sampai air watery
my err itu ah immune
oh you didn't drop out ayah quit
ayah called ayah told me after tu
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
abang kita kena buat recording untuk survey ni kan
oh okay okay can can boleh boleh
um kena berbual pasal apa though like what we
ya I mean movie also boleh and
say that time err me and abang afal pergi tengok movie dekat cinema movie apa
ah your eyes tell dia punya movie is pasal is a ah japanese movie lah so kita dia punya cerita sedih gila
I don't know I was just like tengah nangis-nangis rabak lah but then the cerita is about like satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta temporarily
ya like tak buta mata lah because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like lepas tu like
macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the
eh but then like thankfully like ibu and bapa is like
that time I came back home then lepas tu ah ibu was like um

pakai beli album jer
no because tak no because just like that album is like very cheap
I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like lebih mahal
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe
ah they just go there to take picture ambil gambar aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two punya ni like
tapi macam merepek ah like I don't know like just tak suka it's just like
macam baru ah dah tak suka like that
macam like apa-apa pun
tak boleh kaya kenapa tak boleh kaya aladdin is what

in the future I don't know what I want to be I don't know what I want to like what I'm interested in and all so macam like err kadangkala also macam keliru like I know what to do so macam I guess I want to find like something that
because I feel like I I like to try like a lot of things so macam
when you like to try a lot of things you don't really know like apa exactly like you nak buat in life to me I guess that's like the problem I'm having right now
tak banyak lah

so six thirty dah habis then I balik dengan dia so macam surprise juga apa kan ya so so then macam either that or I still meet them at causeway point ya habis lepas tu end up like we didn't agree on anything ya and then on wednesday she text me yang she ordering food on friday so means dah confirm lah kan ya
I mean not really discuss lah but then like we talked about it but we don't we didn't came to an agreement that okay we shall do this you know that kind macam we just talk then lepas tu but also because it's her house and then we we we know like I think she know I know that like you cannot just come the house that kind because there got one time

cuma just
kenangan kenangan yang lalu ee I don't know I cringe
true especially this year raya like
uh kita tak dapat pergi jalan raya kan then kita tak dapat jumpa most of them so we really haven't seen them like one year plus gitu
oh I thought worst I was like oh my god no hal
can't ejek seh
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my datuk like um
he always like uh cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital lah dia tanya oh adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then I'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like um
I will makan it with Milo or like or like minum teh gitu then I will eat the biskut together
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so I used the biskut as the background of the painting then uh for the forefront of the painting like I put uh my sofa all like from the living room
like tribute gitu
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really rindu art lah
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people yang macam
they ada then uh like they
letak like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked ah but then they are like very bagus in their
word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh
tapi sekarang susah lah because uh COVID ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
legit lah compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung kan
imagine those lagi like
orang is not oh
I don't know macam cool
rasa seh tapi this is like
oh oh I know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
I don't know I think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really seh we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad ah
you just triggered my like primary school memories like I uh like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok Ribena then they they kasi like me macam
pegang the Ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but I don't know how the dia orang buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
um dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu eh
oh but tapi dia buat apa competition
oh dah itu jer
tapi cute seh
oh sedihnya
satu minggu jer
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
jadi macam more environment friendly
I don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam oh just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents kan confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like oh my god that is like duit like I should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like
kumpul duit from uh
family member ah like kita ramai ramai kumpul duit then like beli something
tapi right some of them already uh like dah beli like dah beli the present
ya then they buy like bag wallet gitu which is something that
I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know
dia orang kena ada bunyi gold kan like
mak cik tak trend ah
she just like gitu jer like it's usually like clothes like very cliche ah like clothes bag like wallet
actually boleh juga ah
boleh ah go jer
I think you know I think I can like kumpul then like buy
uh gelang tangan
because itu hari kan me and my sister we went to Tiffany & Co dekat jurong east
then actually kan dia punya harga pon like tak mahal mana ah like it's still like quite okay I can like kumpul duit ah or maybe like can be just like my immediate family kumpul duit then we just like buy gelang or something I think jewelry is like a good idea

something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know
so diorang cakap then the other lady was saying like err eh then you leave then how ah
cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap
yang geylang lorong something ya ya ya ya
macam macam weird ah I don't know whether it's an old
family ke apa ke kan
lah this one I just knew like here dengar dekat radio jer
so tinggal lagi berapa minit you cakap tadi berapa minit
besok confirm aku nak kena like
oh dia apa cakap-cakap oo buat dia cakap apa err
kita talk ah I see
si liza left already then talk take another friend
tak ada lah not confidential just talk about family lah family macam gitu
tapi dah cakap like
tak tahu asal lah dia cakap dia oh
sha sha rambut dah putih like I think she he like she got a lot of white hair so is like like what
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different um two different parts ah so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes mah so in september then they resuming back lor cause the COVID
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike kan macam east coast park kan ada tapi I dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
ah dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap ah dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak kan dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki eh dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay ah but outside school context aku tak tahu ah tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam paiseh aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ pe hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok jer aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya kan abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up ah dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much ah aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang ah tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu ah kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
um a'ah lah dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku um tapi dia different course ah dia masuk dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku kan year two sekarang so tu jer lah yang sama yang lain semua A-level ah
oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another
dress up tak dress up ah pakai dress jer pastu dulu punya baju raya ah aku tahu lepas baju raya dengan buat rambut sikit sekejap jer lepas tu
a'ah bodoh aku makan semua kau tahu tak aku makan semua kuih raya aku yang aku buat aku habiskan tak ada orang nak aku makan aku gemuk during zaman raya tu
my favourite kuih raya will be no doubt kan my grandmother's pineapple tart kau tahu tak aku punya nenek punya pineapple tart special punya
abeh kau punya favourite kuih raya
you talking about the cornflakes ah the honey cornflakes ah I go to everybody's house I sebat you know I makan all of their honey cornflake until I ask them to top up
tu ah like personal experience right then like wah every confirm hor you open your cabinet finish already still confirm got few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth right
yes ma'am then you know hari raya haji also this year at least got the the the curcuit breaker the the the I don't know ah what they call it ah the rule the ruling I think
not too bad ah can visit this year for hari raya haji like like five people per family eh five five visitors per household so you eh hari raya haji you got got visit your aunty your cousin I don't know
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
I cannot tahan ah I think ah I had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker um announcement ah so a bit sad ah then like you know uh cannot have the big celebration like last time so I celebrate with my family lor but then I celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside mah during that period of time so all order in lor then like a bit special kind of situation lah cause first time mah celebrate at home nobody else so okay ah not too bad hor how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
ah I drink bubble tea but like cause I a bit lactose intolerant so I can drink maybe like the small one if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called HEYTEA dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan jurong so tak banyak sangat ah aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea KOI Gong Cha tu semua okay ah tapi aku lebih suka HEYTEA it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if I buy bubble tea I will buy kat orchard ah kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku Gong Cha ah tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
yang colour pink yang mana satu
oh cause I go with my friend ah then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert ah she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like um cause I wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku um pilihkan apa bubble tea like I think I tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl ah I tried the tapioca pearl kot oh tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food ah I think I think this other poly also have is like um Indomie wah Indomie goreng that one the best bro that one like my go to that one ah with horlicks oof me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you leh what's your favourite food in school
wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying
yay finally do you think  kita like  akan ada graduation ceremony
yeah  aku nak ambil gambar semua with like all my friends it will be memorable and
maybe but not so much lah because like I'm so tired of studying and the workload  banyak gila nak kena buat and  dengan  jugak
honestly I just finished my very last assignment then ya I didn't sleep that much honestly so I'm like taking a break  sekarang yeah
it was on my module quality management be ah  soalan dia anything to do with quality lah basically  macam there's something called balance scorecard that kind of thing you got learnt before ah it just  macam companies  guna like for
its quite a fun module ah do you got any module  yang kau enjoy

no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone ah which is  sedih yeah
 kau dah  carik err part time  punya kerja
no actually  aku enjoy seh
because like err  kau tau aku lah  aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home lah because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah I can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku kan  pemalu kan so dah lah  nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through teams all
 itu ah
quite manageable  tapi macam one or two modules  susah sebab ada maths yeah  susah sikit lah hmm
but alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
then  kadang kadang macam
 macam err  kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
hmm honestly I want to  kerja tapi err my parents  nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind  tapi nak kena tengok result  dulu lah cause you know uni kan  susah sikit kan like you have to be at least three point five and  walaupon macam three point five  pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so  macam aku pon takut lah but at the same time also  aku tak tahu nak buat course  apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own lah but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business  tak tau ah  nak buka business  apa eh
oh yeah  aku nak jual apa seh
 tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner ah like rice everything right but there is also the bakery kan of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
yeah you know  macam orang dulu dulu cakap start jer  kecik apa  sikit sikit nanti err
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the  dekat bugis  semua jauh kita kan  tinggal kat west kan  habis cam cafe  dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah

yeah I mean  aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay lah but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it  macam merepek ah yeah

everything is nice actually is like singapore ah but you know their food  macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their  nasi goreng can imagine lah  macam very nice  dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day
yeah actually maybe because of the place that we go to lah but we did  macam go to like their old old houses like I don't know how to say

what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game aku punya bingit which man U game the one with crystal palace ah
K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty
ah okay let let me correct that I play a simulation game okay macam FIFA championship manager you is numbers bro lain sia bro ayam itik

hazard a guess benda ni dekat
oh boleh pilih-pilih ah
primary school mak
dorang pun macam ada inner demons dorang ah
mampus serious ah
robert pattison I cannot bayang that man after that glittery shit show on
so you are talking about macam child molesting kind of
okay talking about children aku baru berbual dengan bini aku a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free
okay bini aku
aku ada Android box but also the smart pun can install there
okay so bini aku past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing tau about how
uh in the last week or last few days alih-alih macam
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and apa okay ah to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing ah and kau kau tahu the controversy behind it
this de-sexualisation of minors kan selalunya I would say kan syaiton slowly syaiton is slowly inserting his influence on these things ah
but err you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins budak-budak ni they are just
it's my niece ah ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world tau kau imagine eh the fact that
and then you have the goal of the director nama dia macam sounds a muslim maimunah the cold or something dia dia dia macam
ah ya lah ya lah one of the subject people from france punya territories ah
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal ini kan but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like oh it's a coming of
aku nak tahu ni who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through budak-budak sebelas tahun macam
he's he plays like nerdy character macam he himself looks like
a'ah sia eh makin is it okay when back in korang ada dengar rumours
one of my junior in and err budak he err lieutenant in the army when I when I came in through when I was in he was already a lieutenant
he went after then ah and he okay dia dia
dia macam apa tau he's the eager to please ah
I can imagine him kalau dalam eh if you take a platoon in their time
he's one of those who first to volunteer first to it very on the ball nak good kid
very quiet ah dengar cakap
always does his best and high flyer in terms of academics and not a bit so dia physically small but willing to push himself
when I was a recruit in the army kat canteen and and dekat cookhouse and he's a lieutenant there he saw me then he
pause for moment and he's dia gagap tau dia macam err err where he almost called me sir
setahun jer ah ah but you know I retain one year that kind of thing so
his face came out in the news lah surat khabar aku baca straits times I not sure whether he did it or not lah I mean if he go by islamic standards I have to verify
did dia nya he put in the dark net or something
orang kita ah
ah favour ah kau forward pada aku kat WhatsApp
and the thing is what I find important is the prinsip behind the marriage tau pasal back in our ancestors punya time dorang
it's not just a matter of it's a matter of prinsip and honour as well tau macam you don't marry for love you marry first and you make the relationship work the love will come later
they he determines the man is suitable then meminang
perlu ah
no I think the prinsip of have a say ni I think dorang ada cuma the tendency at that in point was ah our parents know best ah so if they think is the man is right enough for us then shouldn't refuse ah
ya I will let let benda ni semua kalau aku dapat menantu macam dia kau nak carikan aku carikan aku macam dia
scary eh aku macam
aku okay I I had a talk with one of my closest cousins ah this guy four years older than me

but that back when I had that conversation with him dia baru ada satu boy ah so I was telling him
bro bila nak ada lagi satu dia kata
dia hesitate he wants
more kids tapi he hesitate on getting a daughter dia takut pasal he he says
I don't know I feel for my daughter tau macam takut ah what will happen to society that point in time what she has to go through and kalau dia di apa-apa kan or something ah then
you making jokes ah and then dia some say something I was commenting his team about makeup then she gave me a glare tau dia cakap
cakap we don't dress up for you we don't we dress up for ourselves
tu aku fikir in deep inside my heart
dia kata we we're not fulfilling anybody's expectations only ours bro eh lady you you're at you're fulfilling expectations of big makeup pharmaceutical company is really you they are the ones
you not conforming to expectations relax sua minah confirm kau you can live within your own bubble without looking at the bigger picture and as long as what makes you happy ah
but it's like dorang tak nak they don't even want to hear the viewpoint tau they don't even want to entertain the fact that ah they

okay talking about poly let me just stay back to Netflix ah eh kau cakap you've been watching Netflix kan and you don't want to get caught on the latest addictive thing kan
you will draw the line at games right it's talking about Netflix aje ah I I've been
aku have been caught in watching
so ah kita have been watching this first show which actually was an old show ah it's called breaking bad
eh but better call saul to me is better correct better dia punya jalan cerita lama asal
tak cause you have not
correct ah but but better call saul is ongoing dia belum habis
ah I think season one season two you still ah dekat ah jimmy jimmy ya but kau belum nampak dia punya character development whereby he has his moral dilemmas
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong tapi is
aku rasa three ah three three to four ah then um
then you see how brothers three each other and everything ah so kau dah tengok dia punya abang treat dia macam mana
okay okay so you kau dah tengok part yang dia bastard adik dia ah
he basically tore his brother down to shreds and his brother will macam lookout to him as this ideal brother figure in his illusion
the brother mati ke belum
okay better call saul dah sampai season six eh
but then now not not okay now while while I'm waiting for better call saul to restart aku tengok aku follow up with apa tau with ah
another old show aku tak tahu eh I I've seen this old shows on Facebook orang comment donkey years back I still remember the show tapi aku tak truly realise aku watch
every every season except for season eight witcher aku tak boleh witcher aku try tapi macam aku tak live up no but after that I watch prison break
four seasons siapa siapa no lah
wentworth miller tak he he just came out declared himself as mm ya but but he
you can find it on Netflix ah tak salah aku
okay okay bro okay okay aku
aku bilang kau eh apa aku dah tengok eh I'm I've watched riverdale I'm currently waiting for the new season to come out the walking dead I've aku tengah tunggu dia nya season to come out ah aku watch the good doctor waiting for new season to come out game of thrones dah habis then ah prison break dah habis
ah aku waiting for better call saul to start a new one then aku already watch breaking bad all these I watch in the last two months sia bro
oh ya ya ya right right now starting starting ah aku memang suka baca ah but starting last week
baik sia it's a british show it's it's a good change from the american latino gangster thing ah
okay pasal aku aku
no no no how I do my safe entry basically kalau let's say somewhere which I go often eh tampines mall
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come ah use that same old from maybe last week or something aku malas sia nak scan scan balik ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
A level O level semua keluar a'ah okay
okay ah so boleh ah
but apa double tap terus masuk camera mode apa
code keluar the camera app ah
aku press camera app I point it at the code
a'ah so why double tap can just masuk the app then
tu ah I was thinking apa macam sial ah aku tengok is that a code jadi code to your address or
so what's the ayat
so the start of the ayat start at the bottom
I I see what you did that you got ayatul kursi on
give me a good few suggestions eh ah my dad told me there's this good place dekat somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
ah it's not at mushroom park tau mushroom park is old chang kee punya run is it's a cafe run by old chang kee but it's apparently across err
I know it's across mushroom park atau across the stadium
anchorvale nya
a'ah it's cheap but you can't get anymore melayu then that ah eh
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to lepak or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to lepak
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a mat you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to lepak one corner
oh the cross across the simpang ini kan ya correct correct correct
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay I akan explain apa jer yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita err recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic

okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh
ya okay so let's jump into it apa eh err my favorite artist eh
actually I I ini sebenarnya tak tak ada favourite artist tahu macam I jarang eh
apa err I jarang ini apa tengok tengok cerita
but ah kalau okay but recently I watch a lot of netflix kan jadi macam uh
I selalu tengok the same show bila makan tengok the same show bila
bila buat apa-apa pun selalu tengok same show like I always watch the same show and
okay jadi err apa lagi eh oh ya okay my second show is brooklyn nine nine it's
then apa lagi uh my last show is called don't trust the B
so ya lah ah that's my three show then apa lagi eh ah ya
dia dekat dalam cerita brooklyn nine nine she's all tough rambut dia kerinting like she pakai leather jacket she's all that you know macam
just tough gila ah macam cool gila sia tengok macam like
she is those macam like dia her personality macam strong gila but dia as a real person
but dia as a real person
dia betul-betul not like that not like how she's like in her show she's just chill she's just calm she's very cheerful okay in the show her voice is very macam
kasar macam oi
gitu I don't know how to do lah but
tapi in real life she's all cheery like hey hi gitu like she's all uh she's really cute I don't know you guys if you all haven't watched that show you all just watch
then apa lagi okay so err
let's talk about my second lah okay cause sayang tinggal
dua minit lagi okay my favourite ah is also
siapa nama dia err ya uh kristen bell I think she's very talented
you can't expect people to live at home habis tak tengok cerita apa apa pun
boring gila
err apa lagi eh okay err since kita punya do you have any last words macam like you know to wrap it up
but I thought that mango is an easy topic to talk about kan macam senang apa nak berbual pasal mango apa yang susah sangat so but I I thought wrong so throughout the whole time it's a little bit like um apa seh
and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then apa itu
I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here
um berbual bahasa melayu just a normal thing but kita pun boleh berbual bahasa indonesia because
my family's is an indonesian family so kita my
uh next fluent or I would say a native language would be bahasa indonesia actually
because uh that's that's how I was raised I actually berbual
um my parents' native languages like dia orang punya bahasa asal dia orang which is
err bahasa sunda dengan bahasa jawa so my mom speaks sundanese and my dad speaks javanese so
apa lagi eh
um dah lama tu
macam semua jer kau dah pergi
you berapa lama eh that time
hmm tengok
buka jer scottish highlands islands and cities it's totally calling me ah aku nak pergi
just saved duit somewhere lah right ya
scotland pasal outlander no lah
eh no no no no no I I don't I pun tak tengok lagi seh ya I I I stop at what season four eh ya pasal after awhile macam it gets a bit boring lah as in the cause they go from the mother and then to the daughter then bila the daughter part like macam
and ya this one also ni yang the one that I I I apa ni
then you pergi bergen
then dia pergi err stockholm
oo nurul ain hamidi teringat aku
terpisah juga ya
nak berbahasa baku pula lah
they just say yang mine also just say the mount floyen
what is ikan salmon in malay what is salmon in malay
mesti ada kan nama
I don't know kalau ikan if like stingray is what
ah pari
jingga kecoklatan eh(ppl
I I told you yang the kau tengok tak cerita yang hola spain with keith foo
hola hola spain with keith foo ya eh not bad you know and no and then they do two seasons the second season he cover like uh he did like work trips so the first season was more of macam is like a charted what is it macam tour gitu macam somebody would drive him there but the second one is like his own personal road trip so he goes to like places which are not so
mm aku nak pergi ah
and the roads also macam considered quite clear ah the direction for right
siapa yang drive kau ah
ya aku tak pernah ya I told I think I told you ya
that was the what's that the I don't know what is it called the express train eh tu like london paris punya tu
malam-malam ketuk pintu eh iffah iffah
iffah kahwin bila eh as in the exact date
oh dia push back further is it the
next year aku dah ada few jemputan
iffah my saudara
then my kawan kerja lama
what why does it have to be my birthday weekend actually yang the cousin yang got married also he planned eleven july then aku macam oh my god why is it has to be eleven july then they
perempuan ada amalina perempuan
eh ada amalina lelaki
oh no no no because that time like ah the minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin I I just went to their new house ah
ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak
asal dia masuk angsana pula eh
what is the tempat baru
orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe uh macam dah tengok macam gini kan maybe I could just stay for like
I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay ah but if you handle younger kids susah seh
kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering apa punya orang buat seh like they like always always in the office like you see
consider own free time lepak minum teh minum teh kat lah canteen
orh eh then usually consider gaji besar eh besar gila kan
oh banyak five K
tanah besar kan is it
ah tak potong
a'ah sia dorang gaji tak potong
apa gaji tak potong wah shiok seh bawa balik
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because macam childcare punya principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
climb cuma cuma aku jer yang tak nak panjat
nak stay jer
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered cincai punya ya macam kesah tak kesah jer
but by right macam ya seriously like
ya I mean I mean kita orang dah belajar kan macam macam tak perlu I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept macam how to say ah
it's not like um the malas concept or something but it's just the
I mean every career pun mesti ada macam dia punya progression ah ya but
daripada travel pergi ke sini
check time dulu check time
apa ten days seven night
sama ah
dah menguap eh aku sorry
aku nak pergi umrah lah inshallah probably and then uh scotland is one of them and then also

briyani dia lah imagine you
sarapan briyani makan tengah hari briyani
apa makan malam pun briyani
err muak juga ah
lauk macam butter chicken oh ya and then over there is famous for the butter chicken so it's always butter chicken butter chicken butter ya I can imagine but the thing is so nice it's so good like ugh you just eat
aku kat sana terkentut-kentut sia the last time I pergi dengan my cousins kan so macam stay sama bilik eh sorry eh sorry then dorang ketawa-ketawa boleh boleh boleh inshallah boleh ya

but err as in my first day  pergi sekolah physically
first day  pergi sekolah physically
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan
ah story story cerita cerita lama ah
ya ya aku pun perasan
maybe she just want to lead a private life lah macam tak nak share most of her personal stuff with uh us
ya like I said ada orang macam dia okay ada orang kau tahu macam
err I'm not into this kind of thing anymore macam no reunions for me I I just wanna lead and love my own family macam ya
macam senyapkan diri ke apa ya ada orang macam gitu kita kena respect juga lah kan
sorry lepas aku dah beranak ni I will need to shut you out from my life
biasa lah mister husband
so apparently achin pun nak kerja ni
like macam
insurance agent aku nak berbual
so aku prudential
rider ada apa kira ke aku rider eh tak mail rider aku pillion
orh tak boleh aku punya
aku applied since two thousand fourteen
ya but then err lepas tu they tried to upgrade aku yang sebelum dah aku dah aku tu aku dah ada cancer so ya

even now they have new one yang careshield

macam macam eldershield care lah macam ada dia punya code code number
err dia under
ah islamic punya
kira macam uh let's say macam prudential tapi prudential ada yang islamic punya
ah dia more to islamic punya so she pay for like two hundred dollars per month
ya and ya aku aku rasa dia punya plan is a good plan punya policy ah that's why
TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already
maybe orang-orang kau yang datang cina cina bangsa indian yang
melayu yang tak tahu pasal TAQWA because a lot of youngsters budak muda
macam around yang achin punya age and below kan ah dia orang semua go for TAQWA TAQWA is a more to macam islamic for the youngsters punya
and dia punya agent is all those macam
social media punya influencer ya
ya ya but it's good very good tapi dia punya agent is not a social media influencer lah no
so okay aku rasa aku rider kot sebab for all aku punya hospital bill kan aku tak payah bayar upfront
aku punya government mm

K lah dia doctor siol apa dia heran sia
but male uh gynae is much better then female dia orang cakap
aku punya is uh mixed so aku tak tahu siapa yang akan menghadap aku untuk labour
aku high risk ah
err ada lah but no like the recent punya yang aku pergi yang last month tu ada this one new um male gynae

the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply
lagi ni but I guess I think sekarang market pun more for buyer punya seller market kira seller untung ah buyer kena keluarkan lebih sikit duit
sembarang sahaja lah cakap sahaja lah janji boleh hit that one hour nya ni minute
ni lagi satu nampak benda bukan-bukan semua pakai tudung jer aku tengok
itu lah I think kakak kak ika ah yang mak cakap yang tadi kita berbual kak ika ah menantu menantu wak jenab
toast belt toast box eh ah toast box ke apa yang kedai makan yang ada jual roti kaya ada breakfast pagi punya ada telur rebus
ah mak suka lopong dekat situ kakak tak tahu kenapa cakap dengan mak mak tidur ni tak jatuh ke dekat tepi mak cakap susah nanti nak nak sapu sampah cakap sapu jer lah
berat lah nak angkat-angkat cuba kakak suruh mak buang ni
this one dah lama sini masa kita baru masuk sini kan pindah was like in two thousand
two thousand berapa eh
two thousand one two thousand lepas kakak habis sekolah kan
two thousand one tak salah kakak kita pindah baru dah berapa lama sekarang dah I think twenty years
ah tadi angelia nak cakap apa
yang yang pakai ada bangs eh tudung
of course lah izz tak bawa pergi jalan-jalan macam mana nak pergi COVID
dia cakap apa tak cakap ah tak berbual lah
tu lah kak ika she's not a local she I don't know whether she's already converted to singapore citizen pasal dia dia daripada batam she's an indonesian she's an indonesian
but dia punya berbual you can actually know that she's not here she's not from here dia ada masih walaupun dia sekarang dah
dia dah tinggal lama dekat sini kan but then her accent still have that that that indonesian accent ya
dia tinggal dekat boon lay kan dengan wak jenab
ah wak jenab yang sikit hari yang angelina datang yang tengah duduk dekat luar tu yang kaki berbungkus ah wak jenab

err but she have three kids ah err tiga orang abang
abang baby nombor dua eh abang ram nombor dua nombor tiga yang bongsu abang baby
the first one tak ada
err because dia
dia ikut bapa dia masa cerai kan he followed the father the father is not muslim

kakak first kakak tak pernah nampak yang first anak first dia but but err second at the time mak cakap dulu mak jaga lepas tu mak cakap degil mak cakap buli ah buli mak masa kecil masa that time mak tinggal um mak tinggal rumah sewa kan dekat toa payoh so she brought over ah anak-anak dia

anak saudara bapa semua panggil bapa panggil nama tak panggil cik a'ah I don't know why until now tau habis kalau salam macam kita kalau jumpa orang tua kan salam cium tangan kan tak dia orang tak macam kawan lah begitu
pasal I think dia orang punya age dengan bapa punya age pun especially dengan anak wak masnah nak dekat sama macam dekat lah
nak tak diajar daripada kecil that's why bapa tak rapat sangat dengan adik-beradik bapa

dia macam suka main handphone pasal kakak perasan ah bila macam kakak pergi outdoor activity ada dengan class dia dengan kawan dia on the handphone tak jaga budak-budak budak main-main dia on the handphone
kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
but what options like kan that time kita tengok a few then after that is like
still macam okay lah boleh lah
I think dalam err a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think kita total ada empat orang jer
should be lah anyway pun is
it's dekat mana
tanjong pagar boleh buat apa sia tanjong pagar ada apa
lain kan I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
yang ah oh that one is yang tiong bahru market kan
ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything
I save the earl grey cake sedap eh
aku ingat Andrew buat pasal dia selalu masak kan kat rumah kan buat baking semua
then then andrew was like no bukan aku and I'm like oh
cause can get quite jelak then I don't then when this one is got flavour one that's why I like wah this is nice this is very nice
cause kita selalu kan macam joke joke dengan dia yang dia nak is the type to like burn the kitchen down
yeah it is really pretty really nice like dengan layer layer dia semua ya ah it's really nice
maybe I did see orientation but then like aiya school lah tak de
okay please send me I was like I aku selalu tengok kat Instagram macam kelakar I really wanna watch
yeah I really I really wanna watch how many episode empat kan dah empat lima episode
they got cawan
oh their baju very cute eh
I don't know I don't know when you'll ever use someone's face on your shirt like you'll probably wear it at home you don't kau tak kan nak keluar dengan baju dengan idol kau kat right like you feel very self-conscious I would feel self-conscious lah
pasal dia cause he looks like a damn cloud
eh they also making like the the the other pushies right plushies yang yang dia nya macam enemy

oof the thing that I want err you know sometimes I like to draw right then I like to support other artist punya art then the art itself cost like lima belas dollar aje then then their shipping tiga puluh dollar and I'm like oof tak payah lah aku simpan gambar dia online aja lah sakit hati eh nak beli dengan shipping macam tu
tiga puluh dollar dah already the cheapest then they gave me FedEx one lah then I'm like okay no no that one seventy plus already cannot afford this
oh sekarang tak de eh
that's why it's like that's a lot of money to like kacau orang on the website
I can boleh pakai untuk makanan ke baju ke for yourself kan then go around kacau orang only
kat mana online
dua belas okay what
is it the shipping yang mahal atau or what
oh then you got extra fund then you kau kau pakai lah
eh tell me the shop eh I also want to tengok-tengok
yeah what to do life kan kerja is kerja
kau nak countdown ke tak payah
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why

anyways nenek always lepak under the block and then at there at the at the primary school right always got uncle apa tu ice cream uncle
cause our our nenek and our mum all sit together what
my nenek sit with all their mum and then after that we all come out
and then we go to them salam salam buy ice cream go and play

like ketuk ketuk
ian very very very apa tu
energy banyak energy
err apa tu in primary school I was I was loud but then I was
in my own world in my own bubble you know shiok sendiri
and then apa tu in secondary school more people seem to like me so I talk more to them then I became the leader sort of mm
that's how I got into dikir what
err apa tu the whole cohort for dikir and dance
but then like ya lah macam how to say I wouldn't
cause okay I remember she she always tell me tell me this ah she will be like cause that recently she was like apa tu selalu bila kau nak beli makan kau selalu ulang ulang ulang
ah kau selalu apa tu
suruh nak benda yang sama so like for example she say uh I I say what you want to eat then she say I want to eat mi soto
then I wanted to eat ayam nasi ayam and then I was like okay let's eat mi soto then she was like go buy your own food
okay I miss telling you primary to primary five class his mother is known in school he the mother jual makanan
err and mi soto punya kuah
with the mi soto punya kuah it's really really nice
so first you get the porridge and then you put the kuah
really the bubur and the kuah sedap
we tell the mak cik
at first lah and then after that we started ordering it like huh and that shop sells apa tu fishball noodle
sells mi soto I forgot if got mi rebus and porridge bubur
my school got a lot of jelly and the apa tu the ice cream popsicle
find the western shop with the halal lah
one with the halal ada mac and cheese
gaduh ah why never gaduh
itu lah
itu jer
dah lah pakai tudung lepas tu lari lari kacau orang
he was picking on this other guy then that guy apa tu was starting to cry not cry lah he was like tearing up
no lah but he was just ah he's a very small kecil kecil pendek pendek
si kurap of course I didn't say lah
sweet nya
tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's
memang confirm primary school lah but I don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue eh ke apa
oh apa eleven
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
ah eh speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random ah like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then err kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat err tioman island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to bali and then I met her again just now so macam random lah like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
oh ah tu pun random seh kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder
dia sama age dengan kita eh oh
an hour we should like start a podcast or something lah it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also lah dah lama kita tak jumpa kan and and it's like so good to to finally you know
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
my nonsense my lain my love life lain
same same thing same thing about my work tempat kerja err like my workplace
it's like err the shift timing and all is like change dah tukar semua so we like have to adapt lah ah then
around seven to four and then that's for the morning shift then the afternoon shift will start about four err four fifteen to one fifteen lah and now we change to four macam around
then apart from that also I think design macam like for social media ah poster ya uh macam gitu ah
so uh so cerita apa
you like what what you watch dekat netflix
ah I see uh I see ever since uh apa after COVID then I think like netflix release quite a lot of err nice nice err movie or series and
an italian cafe ah you know dekat bali lane eh ah bali lane ya
err macam sedap ah ya ya
better to macam reserve lah
watch a catch a movie ke apa ya really
like normal lah temperature taking and all then err you you have to be seated err macam just staggered sitting
you kind of have a extra privacy ah sort of ah that kind ya tu ah
I think kan macam
kalau orang itu err okay lah let's let's say macam nak buat plans kan
um macam my my friends wants to make a plan or plan out something and then lepas itu
we already like so into it already then then after that like suddenly last minute they want to cancel lah ini itu lah then ya that that kinds of err annoys me ah
ah suka advance planning tak suka macam last minute ah
ah macam my off days also you need to consider ah
tu ah then how about you
oh okay ya I I mean like it's true lah like macam you're not being yourself err not being true to yourself lah can say
certain things ah macam minor I don't know
like you know do do you still keep in contact with your like macam primary school friends ke secondary school friends like
who who is among your friends yang lama kenal ya still keep in touch
apa eh like they are not
then semua ada like ya like married and stuff ya so macam
my secondary school friend I still I still in contact and one of them is also like I'm I'm in a I'm in a band so ya so macam
macam like even now tengah tengah susah kan like some I think some of my friend also dah hilang kerja ah kena buang ah kena buang
so dia orang macam susah lah
kesian ah ya
so I heard kan you suka you like indo music right
so macam huh indo I can see from your face lah you look you look like the kind lah
macam gitu ah
ya yes yes especially tengah hujan ke apa so wah best mm
very err macam mana nak cakap
mm tapi tak lah macam teruk sangat macam
err heavy metal ke apa ke macam gitu no lah ya but
I also like macam kalau time macam hujan ke
macam time malam-malam I also like to listen to macam post rock you know like instrumental lah gitu ya
like very very dia macam macam
just playing err guitar for example guitar or piano ah macam gitu lah
then dia macam ah ah macam lena ah terlena ya
oh start up business takde lah takde lah apa apa business pun macam okay lah err
it's just a macam err small service lah can say macam kita kita buat err this err apa eh
macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it
that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya

habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken

like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind
I don't know I rasa macam I punya ideal life is very training centric
by the way foodpanda helmet masih ada tak
ingatkan nak pergi ambil besok ramai orang masa tu uh queue untuk ambil helmet
takpe lah by the way ada kerja kosong tak
okay nanti bila hari isnin ke apa bilang ayah lah
macam abang azri pun boleh if not depends ah uh similar to my intern kot
oh by the way then our family this month ada apa-apa plan tak
oh dia orang pun join juga ah
alesya punya birthday oh
oh habis ayah tak pergi
takpe lah kalau tak pakai untuk hotel boleh book apa lagi
okay lah kalau gitu you enjoy your staycation with ibu nanti boleh makan kat cafe kat masjid sultan sana
oh how many season mampus okay no thanks
air fryer buat apa nak air fryer kita takde ke
okay lah tu murah kot ada warranty kan air fryer lagi
oh tengok oh tengok ah macam mana kalau masih ada sale tapi ibu tak nak beli apa-apa
oh habis tadi siang tak cerita dengan ibu
series main macam filem
kenapa suami nicole yang jadi suspect
serious kecohnya bodoh apa
habis kalau gitu netflix ada tak
lol leceh habis besok keluar dalam tak
tak habis-habis sia habis kalau gitu tadi balik tak nampak pun motor scrambler mana motor scrambler tu
dia hantar sevice apa
habis kenapa tak suruh full service jer
uh untuk motor tu
ha gitu jer lah dia tapi tu motor untuk abang ayie eh
ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour
ya waktu
macam tak masuk akal no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works err when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this ah because it's considered their rice work ah
kau tahu macam mana nak buat brownies
because usually aku letak um like um

okay my one that time ah I work huawei cause my one I suppose to tolong the collection for the apa itu dia punya phone collection and then after that I need to if the people send in their phone for repair and then they paid for it I must make sure that uh got receipt
and then they pay the extra amount then got one time um I think my first time doing the collection then ah this pakcik dia punya total was eighty four dollar something something
but then I passed him the phone then I lupa sia then after that he zao already then uh I didn't know until like fifteen minutes later then after that apa itu my manager say ah if by end of the week he never pay the eighty four dollar then I must pay
then I say huh mahal sia eighty four dollar aku tak boleh sia it's like how many hours of work my kerja one hour nine dollars jer so nine it's like two days worth of work sia then I'm like okay I must get that eighty four dollars back
then he pay for it then I was like oh thank you thank you thank you uncle sorry for disturbing you habis lepas itu dia macam okay okay no problem wah nasib sia kalau tak aku kena bayar eighty four sia a'ah

actually I don't get it is it taxes or what cause I heard is some hijrah fund or something I don't get it lah the
cause I watch one video they say it's actually like um people chipping in to go to mekah something like that some
some tabungan ah ya that's why that's why I was like wah you scam and most of it is older people that one like atuk-atuk nenek-nenek they like dying but want to go to mekah that type so they chip in to the tabung ah then I'm like bastard sia

a'ah eh no no no salah salah that was lockdown
cause even if the vaccine come already the job market is still rabak though means maybe when we twenty three baru we find a proper stable job or like twenty two
then some more they say the airline industry will only recover in twenty twenty four so we can only travel properly by twenty four years old I want to cry lah sial lama seh by that time I'm like almost thirty eh
a'ah seh oh ya my boyfriend say even if the border open right now quite risky to go also cause the people there confirm like macam the jobs very low then people there are like desperate so must be careful of your belongings cause they might rob you
sama lah
then aku macam sial lah dia ni bodoh sial bodoh sial
hais itu lah
kedekut eh a'ah calculative sial
itu lah
dah lah kedekut bodoh pulak itu alamak
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam
ya ya ya you told me also lah it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe boleh consider lah
then kau sorang serious ah
ya that one we got no other eh unless you want to bring the the bapa and the anak and the
that time ah I see my friend pergi
like err kosong the whole you know where the
the one that they always do uh free dance dia macam dance on the road gitu
dia ada the road ah
that one dia pergi kosong lah
oh ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me dia orang kena buang kerja
don't know I don't know you pay me also belum tentu I naik
like you know the restaurant yang no the restaurant yang ada kereta kereta tu lah the vintage car
cannot cannot be I tak kerja right I think baru start kerja kot
was it was it berapa bulan ah
oh I belum pakai tudung so that means yeah ya ya I belum pakai tudung so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
first trimester is supposed to be like uh they say what belum melekat yet
the flower one dah habis
rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat
apa people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan
bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I jumpa kat Tampines mart
you know the McDonald's punya carpark masuk right ya ya ya ya
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come jalan
not like macam accident every day also like that that one not accident already
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he sengaja he never
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he tutup
then we run to the main gate masuk
no no no I cannot study at home nanti pergi library ah oh standard
sampai library pukul sepuluh lari book seat
sampai pukul dua belas dua belas lebih satu between that time
dinner after after study at night we go for supper huh tengok
 macam mana badan tak naik
I will black blank out if you tell me besok I told you what I called my mum
uh hello mah then she said ah ada apa
asal Qin
lepas recess ada ada test I didn't study
you stay back right kalau ada your you do after school hours right
apa eh apa eh I buat
I buat I buat acrylic that's why I'm thinking apa acrylic yang I buat I did something
we even have a apa
dah buat dah buat uh okay for example there's
dah buat maths dah buat science dah buat geography belum
art you dah okay and then the other person oh aku belum buat ni okay okay okay okay uh it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation ah
okay finish now siapa nak dah habis siapa nak
uh apa dorang panggil
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but uh apa I represented
so basically kat batu dorang buat macam it's something like chess ah dorang buat ni yeah
he didn't allow us to go in tutup
let's go cabut cabut come let's
cabut I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
the first guy said naik naik naik naik we went out
maju lah she she's
uh ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time lah since dah kena marked also right we
I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
I mean if the opportunity presents itself nak lah kan
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay ah

kalau nak belajar ya okay maybe bila kat uni kan uni kalau tinggal hall ke
this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water

uh dia nya first yang basic dengan
okay not to flex tapi aku aku masuk
uh aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat kan dia nya final theory room
oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke
or maybe sebab kau sekolah bukan private

tapi kalau tak he ignore me he got attitude one
tapi semalam molly macam manja dengan aku sikit so aku macam okay

hari ni twenty nine esok
hari sabtu eh sabtu is saturday kan okay period
kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also
dia punya dorang nya family messed up kan irfan nya
ya eh ni ni skirt yang kau pakai that day eh yang plaid ni
buat kan
sebab dah besar kan
moyang apa ah
damn you saw your moyang
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know
ah ah ah betul
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah

aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping

but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
err okay aku skip to first part eh and then when so he he took this err a pair of shoes
cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah
aku ah aku dah penat aku nak O level jer tau
previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from
which what I thought it would be cause kakak aku macam gitu
tapi aku kena ambil everything then aku bingit siol
ah kakak aku retake
oh siap eh
jap eh
sebab dia macam ada good and bad tau if like your your current self go back to the old times like ada good and bad
oh my god don't forget her benci though
aiya I still cannot forget you know aku tengah copying notes down and she was talking I don't know about what uh shakespeare
aku tak ingat ah but
kelakar gila ah sebab I my meja is the only one that is extended out so literally I'm in the middle of nowhere and like she's doing it in front of me I was like
yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah
sebab tu buat aku penat ah
so okay pada aku really shafwa is just the reason
kau world ah
oh just like that guy siapa eh
ya at that time kau pun macam ah
was it the apa
yang is guy
pengotor seh
macam mana dia nak lupakan kau the girl that was dragged
eh aku nak takoyaki nya where to get ah oh my god so tempted
one satu satu for six dollars
berapa the twenty four dollars plus kan
oo tu aku one seating habis kan
eh jangan ah macam ni tak baik seh
eh aku nak try ni ah yang apa Boms and Buns eh
ya ya ya it's just few shops away from Chulop jer sebab dorang tak dapat beli shop tepi
tu lah aku tengah fikir
eh lepas kita pergi Boms and Buns we can go Spize makan wah aku dah lama tak pergi jalan
when was that bro that's not in bedok actually dekat somewhere else
it's dekat ah lain punya branch eh not bedok
I mean same company ah but different cook what bodoh
I never tadi aku makan ayam masak merah seh like I only eat a little
okay but then kan aku ingatkan aku makan sikit cause I want to buy that that chicken kan but then when
okay wait I finish I wash all my plates already then I open foodpanda just now ah I was I was looking at GrabFood and foodpanda tu then like whoa eighteen dollars
ah ya ya ya you can't deny that it's pedas
entah eh
maybe the chili dah absorb or something no
apa the noodle
okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah
kan dan dia pun tak tahu apa yang dia buat salah kan kita susah nak
nak cakap kan
mengganas ah

the maximum kalau the best ah
um and eh nak join tak muay thai gym together
everyday you pergi
no limitation and there's going to be like macam coach
um they are gonna be there macam ada certain slots certain coaches ah
tak tu tu lah soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu
if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
I usually run um macam about
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat kan
two K two K plus pun jadi seh
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah
serious no joke aku tak pernah tengok
I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's
phua chu kang yang adik
oh betul
kan rambutnya poof
okay K K salah salah
I thought they were itu
dia memang jelaka ke dia every movie pun dia jelaka
ocean eight one is jelaka
he cute I got see him before as in like I mean like nak
alamak takde chance lah
banyak okay K
that time aku kat rumah abah aku then he say uh he ask me ah eh do you want to watch mulan or not then I say
but people say don't support mulan then but then I do want to watch lah macam
tapi I want to see if the cinematic is good or not so
so aku macam okay ah maybe just watch but I didn't really pay attention to it ah
I was not fully there but I watch macam sepuluh minit lepas tu chao
and then after that I came back I oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so I didn't really focus but I kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
ya why kau dah tengok oo on the cinema
oh apa dragon tu mushu eh
aku sedih bila mushu takde because that was that played a very important role you seh
alamak aku tak ingat [ah]
tapi it changes everything seh like the jalan cerita is not there anymore what
I remember seeing that one the the guys macam fooling around mandi
the mandi part I saw that one
ketawa sial like apa jer K but anyway then aku ingat bila
cause yang lagu dia it keeps playing that's all everytime I watch the music keep playing sia then I was like what is this leh why why the like in the real cartoon got so many songs you know everybody's happy
but then this one it's like keep playing reflection reflection reflection sini reflection sana abeh
alamak ku tak dengar
speaking of movies when was the last time you pergi cinema
kita pergi tengok cerita alamak I forget what was the movie called err
it was like err X-men punya series ah
ya macam this group of kids with super mutants ah new mutants ya
ajak aku then K lah
eh aku tengok ah sia
tak semua ah aku tahu the first one
no not the first one lah the first one is normal apa yang dorang
ah apocalypse aku tengok
back to the future dah aku tengok
aku tahu yang err
err yang the first one the first one ya normal kan the second one is the dorang balik right flashback kan the third one is
ah ah si jean tu
mm wolverine tiga ah tiga
bila semua cinema semua busak busak pula buka bila cinema buka
baru err it was one of the movies that was being released together
takde lah when no lah after COVID bah
eh after COVID eh macam COVID dah habis juga
the there's the scooby doo new movie yang macam merepek ah honestly
eh tapi yang the one that I was the the one I was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
aku macam siala
sakit hati tak dapat tengok it's not released
ya abeh dorang semua orang dah get ready ah I think it was
aku dengar bila but it was going to be released
sekali when the government announce yang the circuit breaker period kan lepas tu dorang macam sorry cancel lah ni semua ni semua and it was like a couple of weeks maybe two or three weeks
aku sedih sia I was like walao so close
tapi boring ah bila kat cinema we were separated see and we were three people
so I was like macam mana ni then kita okay lah terpaksa lah I just ask uh apa
I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's
so apa ni
so kita tunggu lah macam McDonald's begitu
even at Timezone tu kali aku pergi
ya aku pergi Timezone
eh Timezone bes seh but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true makan duit a lot
uh same lah like they just kesian aku tengok a lot of people do a lot work seh then macam to me it's extra work ah
oof kenapa pula
ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
all right okay jadi yang abang guide to grabfood ni

ah tu lah
too and and and then they dia orang like buat videos yang can make you pause for a while and like oh I'll double tap that
entah aku tak tahu but we'll find out soon
so like um like you're not you know that that meme yang the person is like um like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see maknanya kiss kiss my teeth
like once you respond habis that's it mm
I do it you know I've got come my adik I do it at nasha when I ask her to like get me something
I am a minah at heart
it's six o'clock that's it I tutup my laptop I roll over to my bed and I buka tiktok
and she was like you tak nak makan eh and I was like oh right dinner I totally forgot
today I learn so macam like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say oh that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically yang bodoh punya
ya betul betul betul
yes yes and we know that musically dengan vine tu semua budak kecil
yes like the budak mana from clementi tengah buat dancing
eh how long have you been going for the uh apa afro ah afro class
so for physical classes macam dia orang kasih berapa orang datang
stamina dah turun
rentak and all
I guess I guess that's the stereotype lah kalau macam malay dance instructor confirm zumba
you lose our pintu tak ada lah
then pakai lagu-lagu seventeen seventeen is known for their very sharp um dances
it's ayam juga
ah it's okay sis dah malam kan dah pukul sembilan fifty fifty
oh my god aku ingat kau dah ada dua phone ni I'm a businesswoman ke
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus I I'm I just
you know what I mean ya to each it's own I trust you I know like if you say suara sedap mesti suara sedap kan
ha tu lah I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff anime you probably won't go the other way
um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer
because just now tak ini packer packer kat dia bilang kau pack apa
toy R us actually okay eh quite good eh aku nak ni green party apa kedai dia okay dok kau tahu kan the kedai jual apa no the green party
you don't know that store dia macam miniso eh
it's okay though that kedai
what if kau kena tengok shift dia juga shift dia dengan
shift dia dengan dia punya working hours
jauh oi okay true
I don't know kalau kau nak aku boleh
kalau kau nak aku okay I don't know ah I feel like
but semalam aku ada bilang kau kan yang apa tu
yang aku screenshot lah kerja tu
mana eh
ada safe distancing ambassador eh kat sentosa eight dollar per hour jer kot
kau just uh they they what they say is that
bodoh lah kau
kau kan
entah lah everything's okay though I can say belum ah baru submission oi
tak kita tak ada kita dah tak ada ah
okay I understand I don't know ah I feel like those abeh macam general studies and all right I I don't understand macam nanti like apa kita buat then like what we dapat is like the hell
mm entah eh
eh legit ah makan ramen stall aku nak try ni ah ball
tu apa bukan tu boat noodle ramen stall is the japanese punya ni sebelah dim sum punya ni kat haji lane
macam aku nak tunjuk aku tengah record
a'ah eh betul juga eh
but then I don't want to spend so much today eh aku dah tak ada duit I spent but tipo honestly is berapa eh berapa dollar ah
allowance for this month and then kalau aku tak kerja aku tak ada duit kalau dah habis
oh my god don't say aku punya printing jer one time printing fifty five dollar eh I have to print my uh board I have to print my
apa tu photo book
ya because our now is like macam
apa tu macam buku ah kirakan
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat abeh macam mana
entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month dah one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya tu masih suka eh aku masih uh kerja kat seh baru baru oh my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast eh really really fast

you know like it's pointless if we keep advising but they don't really ya honestly aku tak kisah kalau dia tak nak ikut ke tak because it's usually up to the person lah but at least consider of what I say lah or like try to say it in a way whereby kau kau akan kena you know or like just reflect prepare you ya ya so it's like you are not you are not actually hearing what I said ya
what again I thought they have been bestie again daripada dulu sampai sekarang

ya lah it's just the makeover you know entah lah
kau jangan merepek lah kau aku pun tak tahu kadang-kadang keluar kadang-kadang turun balik I'm not in a constant mood aku dah malas already
no it's not about that dengan shah aku memang tak kisah
cause aku tak pakai makeup uh aku pakai makeup aku pakai makeup that time kan dia cakap
uh you tak mahu pakai makeup ah asal
uh tak ah tak ada apa-apa then like apa dia ni berbual then aku aku that time insecure gila ah cause aku tak pakai makeup aku dah penat gila then dia cakap
tak payah makeup makeup dah lawa then aku macam okay ah ya but actually I don't know cause aku dah biasa pakai makeup so it's like a routine lah so once you tak pakai makeup it's like shit ya so ya that's me ah but honestly
entah eh because seeing back me and year one right I actually
aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh
apa tu dressing up and all when you're school is how many hours jer
entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G
oh girl same class then kita just all the way together ah plus from there aku tanya dia like
uh why you not rapat with the other girl semua like our class semua okay aku cakap gitu ah macam all about the worried about the class thingy
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
hidup mesti ada concept
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh so dah okay eh
tak lah nama nama samaran ke apa tak tahu
masih oh okay okay boleh boleh okay good
so apa apa safian buat dekat dia
a'ah nama dia siapa
oh tak macam mana macam mana safian buli lah
macam mana safian buli
habis tu dia happy happy ke marah ke sedih ke excited
dia nangis alahai
asal mm tapi I think dia ada love hate relationship with you ah
alahai okay lah slowly lah slowly slowly tak nanti
oh oh so so apa tu nama dia so dia dia dia marah ah macam mana macam mana marah
then apa tu nama dia
oh habis tu dia tinggal kat mana
tak issue lah hmm hmm
macam bedok tu semua ah okay
you going to do apa satu hari dua hari
is it yang apa ada satu part ni dia orang daripada
ah tak salah lepas tu macam dia orang macam staycay dekat one of the hotel eh
tahu-tahu ada yang dekat east coast or something like that tu jewel eh
ah tapi dia orang take three days what
and some more you must take note eh apa tu hujan december time hujan ya
maybe your your plan may work on other month macam january february ya tahu
tapi safian punya school term sampai bila ah

that statement melayu tak setia is it by your friend punya experiences or what
then your friends punya experience

mana tahu you ada kawan perempuan lepas tu dia break hari-hari pula every month
so your friend is the one yang yang wah player sia playboy

apa A&W
okay what if like what what what if like someone confess to you that that she got a crush on you ada
makan kat mana mcdonald
boleh lah tapi macam you guys are still schooling itu semua macam it's a bit too ex for you guys
mm safian dah graduate then now you are in
so got like at least macam basic pay lah I don't know how much then
err habis tu perempuan ni okay this girl like like interested in you tapi dia pun nak pergi high class how will you react
okay what if like macam perempuan ni macam okay lah she she nice tu semua macam dia dia cantik cute apa tu semua okay you like her tu semua
dia punya attitude just
how would you react ataupun dia macam dia dia dia kaki kikis dia macam mesti macam everytime
everytime dia dia cakap macam nak keluar kan mesti kena pergi high class punya tu serious ah
tak what what what if like tak dia punya personality semua bagus okay dia punya attitude but ah baik bukan sucks attitude dia bagus tu semua and all that then dia macam
is like a dream girl macam you know she got everything itu semua
tapi kan
macam she just want to go out with you macam high class restaurant tu semua lepas tu bila kau orang keluar kan tak boleh kena hujan tak boleh kena panas
tak boleh public transport kena grab
tak tak tak tak I want to check the timing so you will like to like to list down pula oh lagi sepuluh minit so you will like rather go out with someone who is like average looking apa tu semua
kalau control macam macam
oh macam dia cheat lah that kind of thing
okay but then again if if someone ada niat untuk cheat right
anything any possible mean and way they can do it ya so macam it doesn't mean on the look macam sometimes dia macam boleh macam
even sometimes macam okay lah I got I got hear and and see before with my own eyes macam muka dia macam biasa jer tau still can cheat
I don't know I don't know how lah but then like is is just possible anything is possible also ya so I guess at the end of the day it's just niat dengan hati

ah ah macam confess ah
okay for girls right sometimes we like to jual mahal like me legit legit so
tak lah I mean like macam ya it's just a phrase like macam
okay then then in order to know if like she is really not interested in you ataupun like like nak jual mahal right you just continue talking to her if she still like continue talking to you right
macam like a few months later then like tengok ah your your chemistry with this person lepas tu try to macam go out with dia tu semua
tapi jangan jangan cakap lagi yang you interested in her so macam if you guys macam rasa macam there's a chemistry between you guys there's like something going on with you guys right
ya lah I mean like I mean okay because you already told her that you are interested in her then she said she's not interested in you what betul tak so so you already accepted accepted that then that's macam for you for you now you think that she treat you as a friend jer so in order to proceed to the next level tanya dia what do you what she see
macam itu because some girls are like just just not interested lah gitu
tapi kalau dia macam fickle minded macam one moment the she she treat you as a err more than friend macam you know macam
more than friend ah macam gitu
cakap no lah we are just friend apa tu semua
yes tu pun fifty fifty ah

the haircuts lah I just go to normal neighbourhood barber shops like bawah block punya
and the pakcik will cut your hair and it's really I think that's more comforting ah cause cause I see all these young people do ah and then the places
that they make the shop that they make ah is very intimidating you know you know like sometimes you takut you know you'll be like
eh what's this ah why they all this abang-abang like
then the pakcik will be like eh ah sekolah eh
then like oh sekolah ke kerja then like oh kerja ah oh ni
wah gila eh thirty days

but then sekali kena the circuit breaker
cannot lepak lah cannot do this cannot do that lah but then we still lepak at zoom ah so is uh I don't know ah it's very it's very weird feeling I hope
semangat lah want to still want to lepak cause I know is is ah very very difficult for other people also ah those who no got no support from friends during this circuit breaker wah that one rabak that one sure rabak

we were googling on uh how to grow taller then ada they got sell some pills and stuff but then they say
lajukan your hormones or something like that
I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
macam that
but then you only do a little like sikit
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling ah
naik or turun
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me ah that like
so my mind is literally macam peanut
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
different tiktoks everyday kan macam like it like within
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and stuff like that and and like to reach out err to a bigger audience but macam
like I masuk also to tengok what people
no I masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to macam
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
the first time apa ah
who was like cause like his his profile he put there macam
I was like oh he is one eight one that's tall then I was like oo I'm going to talk to him sebab dia tinggi and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
like atas sikit
macam like a higher angle you know
you know my dock marts punya sandals
so it makes me taller sikit ah then tadi I was walking beside my mum
then jalan jalan jalan then I was like
then she was like because if you do that nanti you will imagine how aryan will see me
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay
aku nak tengok ni drama perempuan tiada dosa eh perempuan yang tidak berdosa right ya

macam quite cloudy ah chey cloudy ah
eh kirakan eh like we were quite um active in performance ah back then ah
ya kebun or I don't know it's something to do with a farmer ah
wait let me guess let me guess you are the cow right you are the cow then err wait wait wait oh this one I can remember bro okay okay err I think err that time kita tak ada topeng right
oh then kau kena kau nak kena stick out your fingers right
actually kesian ya I a bit kesian ah
aku itik ah

confident because I had the mask on you know people knew I was the the itik of the moment you know
I were itik
oh okay I had one I I have one tak apa nanti aku share
err then err there was one in a masjid ah eh was it masjid or apa eh
ya because kita how to say like want to you know like perform we don't care about the world bro kita just like want to perform like really perform and then done
which was a bit macam irritating ah kan okay at that point of time um
err from my father's point of view ah kan okay then no no no kira in my father's point of view it was irritating ah
like err I think kira macam macam back then right um probably he was a
maybe he was tired then we got him at the wrong time so so dia bingit ah kan
eh my memory ah kan okay so um remember not we used to go to err rumah mak long for another purpose
we actually kita macam like we go tuition also macam
I don't know eh like forced ya forced but then I was quite um looking forward to because you were there ah sia abeh
touched ah kira ah
so anyways um ah macam eh jom ah lepak
even though our our houses from here from our houses to rumah mak long it was like what five to ten minutes walk
abeh kita tumpang bro
asal ah

apa tau we didn't smoke but
kita pakai mancis bro kita we use matches to actually what okay err we burn the matches so we we took out the fire and then there's like the remaining smoke right and then tu asap we'll actually put it inside our mouth
but we didn't like tarik right then we just actually like

like I mean you it's impossible to actually keluar negeri you know you to to to get out even to you also because we love to go to like um macam nearby like your um furthest okay malaysia is lah
I mean to do that now is err sad to say it's impossible because of the current situation abeh macam kita rindu like we really miss our friends in in malaysia you know then there's japan korea and blah err whatever not but
yes yes live shows meaning macam err letak ah like facebook live then err ada
ada ada mm
tak active lah
direct lah lagi lagi reliable lah kan
mm iya lah tu
eh but ya aku faham ah like err because at one point of time also aku like I want to delete facebook
tak tahu eh macam it's it's actually a waste err like okay sometimes err or in fact most of the times ah when I look facebook right I look at facebook it's about it's news err like like err about the current situation than there's um
depends ah depends ya but is most of the time nanti kadang-kadang you know like like err news then there's err music updates abeh ah yang those bands yang aku like minat ah aku look up to their facebook then aku will try to see what's what's going on ah in their lives
updated ah but but but for me to macam okay for
aku nak post err benda-benda aku sendiri aku post like something macam bodoh ah like it's something funny never never serious tak pernah rasa macam leceh ah
mostly bila aku nak post tu is err kebanyakkan like err funny stuff ah I I don't like to post macam benda-benda serious ah ya macam entah life is too short to be serious
dia macam kelakar seram oh
oh ya ya the comments speaking of which actually we're supposed to talk about music right oh this is about music right okay okay sorry sorry sorry kugiran music(ppo
ya but anyways ya that that facebook thing that we are talking about sekarang ni kan macam I also agree ah like most of the time kan nanti aku tengok um the comments eh nanti aku kekek sendiri ah
very sungguh punya truthful
eh wait I'm sorry kau daripada penang kan
ni cerita betul lah ni
sorry to interrupt the the one in the picture outside ah oh that's your the grandfather that kau tengah berbual ni ah okay okay sorry carry on
speaking of many kids err aku punya cousin eh sorry kira mak aku punya cousin ah punya side eh

oh it's a kira macam french punya kind of err usually okay usually luke is L U K E kan
right ah so this is french kira french punya version of
luq apa ah
just err ya let's go back to like currently let's go back to the ya the which is music ah so kira like nowadays kau dengar what kind of um music ah
and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul
betul understood understood I faham faham
kira him selfish lah in one way or another
mm lepas tu
oh macam gitu eh
mm betul
I mean in your situation now of the fact that kau macam you I mean you kau kau agak you are quite
you are in a situation you are in a difficult situation right now lah like like does your family macam help you out do do do they do they like err do they like give their their hand or shout out to you like eh do need help do they even ask you eh syaf kau okay tak
macam mana babe
understood understood is it intentionally atau macam
ya lah faham faham
dia pun tak tahu dia I mean in that kind of situation dia pun macam ah don't know what to say
wah the quite young ah you shavana your your brother dah ni kan oh ya ya ya ya so should be
you are now kita twenty nine
and your mum has not remarried eh sampai sekarang eh
your mum has not remarried sampai sekarang eh
understood lepas tu
kecoh ke oh my god this is so macam oh my god
yup betul betul
mean he lost it lah tak dapat
oh your oh macam your father is the macam very the old school punya ni eh
very dominant macam apa tu match up begitu tapi ni lelaki punya
ah kalau old school ya betul betul that's true it's true it's true
mm faham faham faham
mm betul
eh no err not bumi err in syurga syurga
correct correct so your your your sister said your mum said tak nak lah
betul betul to repay him back like you you you guys feel like macam aiyo kenapa aku nak kena kasih dia duit sedangkan time aku besar dia he was never there in your life
mm betul betul
so he he I mean he's I mean not not it's not calculative it's just that he likes to compare and count like that lah in money in belanja
ah faham faham faham
ah faham faham faham
mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam
babe kalau
so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
so kalau tak kesah ah kalau it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself tau tak dia tak err like I don't need to put duit inside lah biar dia biar pakai jer refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu err I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu ah
top up ah top up tapi bukan kita yang top up ah
uh tak tahu siapa yang top up ah tapi terima kasih jer
nak kahwin oh tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu ah
terus suami eh takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
tapi korang ada pernah macam uh fight ke apa ke
so far belum ah mm okay tapi sekarang kan
sekarang kan macam COVID kan so cannot really meet each other that much apa
oh but how frequently tu
but like for me I remember bila I was dating kan uh we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin I also know that takkan jelak ah
tak serik ah tapi okay ah dah dah come on ah dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine lah kan
eh panggil dia apa makcik cik
apa-apa jer jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
oh tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
oh ya ya ya oh dia tak tahu
mak dia jer tahu ah
oh asal dia tak bilang
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret seh
okay so do you guys like macam
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know ah middle chair honestly I don't know
problem with that so far takde lah
bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
a'ah so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
oh movie apa
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
lelaki tu wah
memang macam like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya lah but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
kedai ya
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think kena tengok right
your abang is my adik
I think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like eh like macam like when I watch it I was like oh my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know uh macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
then lepas tu he I think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because I also because like dulu kan macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
because like I remember one episode kan like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
school like not really a professor lah by research scientists and then lepas tu like um banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
kan and then like um dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in lah but then lepas tu then he realise that oh my god
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing lah because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan ah kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that um apa tu to like
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
terus jump to it
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast kan dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like eh let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
oh because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
I know you said you show me the photos mah and then macam it's damn nice what
no lah but waffle kan macam murah takkan they will charge you lah
okay but haji lane is overpriced sebab tu lah you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore kan it's usually cheaper
ya lah that's why it's cheaper lah kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
what no lah but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
so you become like ibu
design the place itself kan macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai lor
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes kan you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa tau cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool lah like
you know like your makanan K cause your makanan tak sedap kan at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
ya ya lah you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
actually I want to ask you kan macam like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts um if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam K if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like oh I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like kan like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar kan tak fun
cause like I feel like I'm macam sangat lost
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like I think you will only get like
like kan siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world lah because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so that's why I like I like the so for me macam like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working kan like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
even though I know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay lah maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya bukan like the
ya cause you know like if you go jakarta like I don't know you wait did go batam ya you went batam before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care one ya
they do though because that time I went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
ah dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik sia they were like oi is you new like why
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend lah then I was like oh my god what's this maid doing ah
ya I tak kisah so I just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
tapi like
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
ya so we all ya I think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips sia so I think it's like I think that's a good thing eh
dia sounds like internship kan then I was like wah
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
macam like banyak orang that like
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business macam it's easy to
okay lah it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like macam I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
you should go with afal adik
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know macam tempat
tak bersih sangat lah also it's okay ya ya they don't care one
science kau ah
kak ya you know inshira right she's working like so called full time in nurse
who's kak epah
kak malinah that one is
ya oh tapi K takpe kita boleh masa baru
oh I see semua busy
ya but I used to be sociable but then I realize like eh okay because maybe I tak I think I know why cause you tak you've not enough money
bagi set aside budget berapa like berapa duit
wah lama sia
oh you nenek say that
mahal is it
like cheese I don't understand yes ibu also don't like but ibu okay with it you know why
I setuju oh you ramen
no ask kakak to help you lah
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but I don't think macam like podcast kan ada
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya I know what you mean like macam but for me right if I clean I'll be happy
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap
tapi you kena pergi yang macam err healthland lah that one professional and thai odyssey lah tapi jangan pergi yang um tepi-tepi jalan punya that one a bit scary ah
ah ah kaki
kan sedap
sudah habis ya me also
itu lah
err boleh cakap pasal err apa eh nama dia makanan favourite ke
oh pedas type sudah try mala
msla sedap
oh plain then you should try apa itu green curry
should try sedap sangat sedap
it's creamy and then after that dia ada macam a bit pedas-pedas then got manis like all the flavours ada lah in one
I tak tahu
oh oh yang tingkat bawah itu eh
lah I always thought itu tak halal so I always buy the drink sahaja aduh yes now I know oh my favourite thai green err thai my favourite thai drink is thai green milk tea
oh carnation tahu dia orang pakai
no haven't sedap ke
I always eat at this macam err outlet dekat mana eh dekat far east plaza I don't know if you know
huh uh dia tingkat bawah I don't know if you know cahaya cahaya tingkat atas tapi yang thai food ini all the way tingkat bawah dekat belakang
huh uh dia tingkat yang sama macam yang korean supermarket itu
ya authentic thai tapi halal
yes I'm more of a cahaya fan tak tahu kenapa
preference ya err what I like from cahaya is the apa eh mushroom dried noodles itu mm sedap
oh sedapnya
ya I also aduh then dia punya wanton pun sedap but I haven't tried I haven't tried puncak one
why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya
cause I find like big bang punya new music is like different tau now dia orang sudah disbanded kan jadi macam sedih ah
ya I listen to those two band sekarang kan banyak orang suka right
but sorry to say lah I tak suka dia orang
I I kalau cakap I tak suka kan kawan I semua kutuk I jadi I say ah ya I like their music
ya sudah tua bangka pun suka K pop
aduh dia orang have a pop up store dekat singapore tahu dekat plaza sing
I pun tak ambil
ya now I never listen to shinee shinee I used to call it shinee you know shinee shiny see sampai sekarang dia bawa bawa
shinee aduh so like last time masa I kecil kan I obsessed sangat dengan big bang um so my file every page of my file kind of the film kind
thin film I akan tulis quotes from big bang
ya bedsheet pun big bang bantal pun big bang
ya I memang crazy about big bang dulu
ya I think so dia punya story very pelik lah dia punya story it involves almost everyone that you didn't expect
ya macam gitu kan like uh I tak sangka I was really shocked
ya sedih duh I was like genuinely sad when I heard that he's out of big bang like wah I grew up with them tau
tapi if you follow him on instagram sekarang kan dia macam a bit siao ting tong ah
uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang

orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know

ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians

oh bukan yang hood punya dia tak ada hood
I bought it err okay last year masa I kerja I pergi rush pergi uniqlo I don't know why during my lunch break lepas itu I pergi capai itu oh my god it is like the best spend out of my pocket money

uh ke I bought it in malaysia no lah I bought it in singapore
twenty to thirty dollars macam gitu ah
but what am I saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best ah
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt kan cotton on is still the best though
okay I tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya
dia punya how to say graphic dekat depan itu cantik then I will probably buy it
if macam tak cantik I tak akan beli lah
tapi honestly
banyak orang suka pergi thrift shopping

then when I was primary six we went on a holiday then after that I kena accident
then in the accident like I was at bali then I was going back to singapore from malaysia then after that uh the car swerved cause like something hit my dad's car dari belakang tau then after that he swerved inside the longkang
then after that he went atas balik like he swerve the car back up lah but then when he got back the car on the road was like the other side you know like how it apa tu the car cars are going this way his car was already like this side and he stop then after that four of my siblings were out of the car like tercampak keluar then when I suddenly I was in this longkang like nasib I sedar diri if not they wouldn't like find me cause I was in a very deep longkang but then my legs were all in pain so I cannot like panjat the longkang ah cause I wasn't that steep but my legs was really really in pain then I shouted for help then this guy piggyback me up cause ambulance wasn't there at that point in time so I was put inside this car then my adik was also inside that car also aiman aiman
dia pun kat dalam kereta tu then after that bila ambulance datang I was like vomiting a lot lah because like the apa itu how to say ah traumatic

then after that they almost like took another person like cause my bed is here then another granny's bed is here so it's like tepi-tepi tau like side by side then after that she went like the person dah already angkat the grandmother
my dad wasn't there at that point of time and then my dad was like eh this one yang pergi singapore bukan itu so the the granny almost went to singapore then the the nenek was like very confuse lah

my dad had to angkat gini
when aku sakit dorang like like a lot of people was around then he was stitching some stuff aku tengah sakit tau then after that they keep like talking loudly

so like like it's terbuka the flesh all terbuka they didn't clean the the wound properly
then after that um my mum also not happy you know malaysia right they they ask you they insist that you go to apa itu that you stay in the malaysia then they ask you for money every single time they ask you for duit every single time
uh they ask for duit everytime then you know even my my adik want to wants to go back to singapore cause my mum already dah already going to inside ambulance you know the nurse have the audacity to say my mother that he cannot bring the baju that he was wearing cause that is hospital punya baju

their school pun their atas eh their top was plain plaid blue it was very very nice then the guy wore the plaid type
sakit ah mata
hmm ya lah you can kau tak amazed dengan senior jer kan
aku I didn't pandang seniors at all

sec eh eh sorry sorry primary five primary six sec five eh primary five primary six apa tu uh I had this friend nama dia alia
um she live near here also sometimes I see her but she looks the same anyways ya then I was very rapat with her lah I thought it was like we we will be best friends that kind of thing and then after that this amira came into the story then when amira came dorang started to be rapat then at first I was okay lah then we can all rapat together what then I tell her like you know we have this stay back during holidays for primary six

ya cause that time we went during raya what
then after that she also satu hal ah I think she don't like me also then she
her mum pakai tudung I think she is religious
disappointed she she ah dia pun ada adik the adik I think now secondary school still
me uh um buka cerita this one I had
cute ah dia dulu
shut up diam ya every morning
then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes

like he made fun like cause there was this girl she's not wearing hijab but he can like sengaja see the sepender

so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh

aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play
ya then after that you baca
they they cari you cause you're the only one who can baca quran kan
like the where they simpan all the sets semua
he panjat
exactly pukul satu pagi sia why you telling me this now wah you fucking asshole
then dia orang tak dengar dia pukul pukul dia pintu ah
tak tak sangat ah
so you say later you sneak out again malam malam betul

three girls then me and another guy so the girls already got the baju then she want all of us to have like matching colour so besok we have to go cari like a baju that matches the colour
go cari the baju
the semua tempat jual baju kurung ah
kat tampines
huh like her tempat kerja offer then you just get free flu shot
oh ya you what you doing tomorrow eh wait so kau kerja

kan ah itu susah
ada pekik kan a'ah
um kat sekolah selalu kena check in check out temperature taking semua
tak suka ah
nak minum air pun susah kena keluarkan mask semua
macam lek bro lek bro cuma nak minum air
a'ah kena kena nak kena sepak muka
oh oh did I tell you about kat sekolah kat sekolah kan got this girl dia macam irritating gila babi tak tahu
a'ah dia macam bites off macam gitu you know
dia macam tengok aku macam stare stare macam gitu
tak ada tapi like I I cakap dengan dia like tapi her vibes macam really off lah like dia macam suspicious dia macam cakap dengan aku like one way then she will go out and then she will talk to someone else another way
okay tapi kan like
I felt very petty lah tapi like um what's another like do you have any like macam petty reason
you like don't like somebody even though like macam
just met ke atau
macam Tinder ke muslim match ke
but it makes sense because macam like if you going to get to know that person
and then they they are like the way their vibes macam tak link dengan kau so it's very weird of course of course you would say no
kau gen Z
ya semua semua online
like orang can find like what they need to know about you through online social media semua tu
if you going to use normal you going to use a different name itu kan catfish
okay kau betul kau betul
kalau age lain sikit macam um please remove remove ah kan I mean as long as you're over twenty one so it's
macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way

kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody
macam overly clingy
to get kan duit susah
I just macam
kat padang padang killer yes oh it's farm

ya ah a'ah macam gitu macam gitu macam gitu macam abang bulat abang bulat nak cakap macam chill talks kat midnight ke
um probably macam I'll talk about my
two elders so gizmo's one of them and then like precious is the other one ya I feel like she will be low key macam
hidung tinggi a bit sombong sikit because she's very pretty she's very pretty
ya but tapi right I think she will be the macam queen bee very pretty tapi dia very macam
oh banyak sia
I got four other cats eh macam mana
alright okay then my other cats dulu dia nakal dia nakal banyak so like she's she's like those smallest
dia macam cili padi a'ah ya she's a cili padi I love her

like she got she got ya ya ya ya she got high she got high energy ah so sometimes dia macam like lari lari lari lari from left to right
ya ya dia lompat dia lompat like on the rack semua on the wall pun dia macam spiderman
but I think kan she'll be like macam
the sweet one tapi dia got probably dia ada social anxiety
cause dia takut orang
ya tapi sorang dia macam hyper gila dia macam takut a bit shy malu-malu ya then like got another one um her name is peppy
I found her kat bawah blok dia tinggal kat rumah tapi kan we found her macam wondering macam like a lost puppy

nine nine nine abang polis
sorry ah dogs are a bit macam susah
you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever
a'ah the only time dorang macam very noisy is macam they belum sunat ah
a'ah belum sunat
ya ya ya when they belum sunat they macam like itchy then they cari cari mata air they cari lover so macam of course lah they very
but dogs dogs sometimes they just bark for no reason like kalau like if you have jin in your house like they would just bark
oh got one time when I was younger lah dulu-dulu macam primary school there was a
and then it broke through like one of their glass panels so it's ya it was like a there was like a macam
it's so tiny though I don't know it just like okay first macam it was already at the door then I was like okay
tapi got panel so I'm like whatever I'm just going to wait for my lift then
then suddenly all I hear is the dog barking and then suddenly he's at my ankles so I was like what do I do macam mana ni
cili padi ah
macam macam short people
but like of course these people who already got their doctorates from like nineteen fifty two dorang macam aiya I did it before you can confirm do one
ya but but right okay um so singapore always says like hi it's a very difficult time so like if you need if you need um help please go find it and then they like give you macam like all this like hotlines to call if you're having like anxiety having depression blah blah blah
that's why otherwise macam
bro tak boleh lek lek pe
kan macam like stop demonising tattoos or like macam or like piercings
macam it's very bland it's like macam you you masak ayam masak merah but there's no merah
ya so so can we can we bring it back um I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise ayam masak merah with the merah
you close your eyes tutup mata sudah
err just now the chinese lesson err was err was uh I was feeling very very tired uh sebab uh penat cause tadi pagi uh saya pergi ke sungei buloh nature reserves

err semalam uh I spend like almost for the whole day at err I was studying for my studying for my exam for my finance exam so most of the time err kat kat lah belajar jer sampai from pukul satu sampai pukul enam gitu
ya I just study makan uh belajar makan belajar makan belajar makan ya uh
err uh actually I bought food from bukit batok bukit batok I didn't buy anything from cause macam nak macam nak save duit eh nak save duit kan so err I bought from a like a bukit batok store a store from bukit batok yang jual yang kat bawah that kind
ya so the food there macam nasi lemak nasi ayam is like uh macam murah-murah kat sana it's like dua setengah like one satu satu satu setengah gitu so macam very murah then harga dia harga dia murah so err kalau tak sedap tak apa lah ya so that's what I had for my lunch yesterday
mm kat mana it's like bukit the bukit batok one
dekat kan
apa err is it nice
err maybe macam dah lama tak makan burger king
I went out for dinner with someone so kita err we went to try out this cafe at jurong east um the new cafe ah so yesterday dia punya uh it was its opening day um I forget what is the cafe called lah ya but it's near err area that that that jurong east area ya so uh when the food macam uh it's boleh tahan lah macam
um not the best not the best decent decent food ah so I tried err fish and chips err I tried fish and chips and err order also mushroom soup ah so the fish and chips macam apa tu uh boleh tahan lah macam lebih baik kalau it's apa tu lebih garing eh lebih garing ah and dia punya apa tu dia punya dia punya flavour eh
err is not my taste lah not my taste ya then their their mushroom soup is fine err macam terlalu salty for me ya
no the taste macam masin ah masin salty ah so I had err this tea called strawberry mango tea which is err interesting it taste it's just not bad lah it smells not bad the tea is like any other tea but the smell is good
err just to try out new stuff lor like he's a foodie so macam uh just go go around try new halal food see if it's nice in singapore there is not much halal options right so you just want to see see macam just take a look see see eat eat a bit here and there
we shared the food because err the err he he ate in the morning like before he came out so macam he's trying to I think he's trying to like do a bit of weight loss also lah cause he quite big size ya
twenty four hours so there's also a drive through kan ya so we we just it's a drive through ya so we just uh we went there for awhile just to macam have a bit of dessert lah macam so we we ordered like err two mocha iced mocha latte
ya I suka
ya so it was it was not bad lah macam it's uh is a bit uh ex apa tu a bit mahal and a bit uh sweet ya sweet tapi just sit down there macam just to berbual-bual jer lah berbual-bual talk about stuff
kat mana like how much
oh I think it's the mi Maggi one right mi Maggi noodles
tak nampak benda-benda halus eh
a'ah seh now now like uh sekarang tengah hujan right uh it's hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu ah kan ya tapi macam dah it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like macam it's mendung it's cooling
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and it's just nice weather ah
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy lah ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit err it's like it looks very wet basah cause of the hujan
which is what you want teleport
so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
you go kerja is it
ni hari today I wake up then I never do anything sia like I wake up right I wake up quite early but I got no school today so like I don't know what I

she reply pun like after every two three days lah um ya
eh should I mandi
motor kuat bro
my father hantar me to school naik motor since like primary school
is gonna go and pergi mandi
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak
oh you mean that time uh masa masa uh masa collect that time eh takde that time when I collect kan takde orang pun dah habis dah dia orang cakap ada seribu jer helmet

ha cerita dia kalau nak tahu pasal bunuh-bunuh dia ada nicole kidman tapi bagus ah dia dia thriller cerita dia ah okay lah cerita sikit eh nicole kidman ni dia sebenarnya psychiatrist suami dia doctor untuk cancer uh untuk budak-budak so kirakan dia orang dua ni kaya ah lepas tu anak dia orang sekolah atas high satu hari tu ada budak baru masuk sekolah pakai scholarship budak tu bangsa sepanyol
jadi mak dia jadi kawan dengan nicole pasal
anak nicole pun sekolah situ kira macam antara dua darjat ah yang sepanyol tu miskin si nicole ni kaya pendekkan cerita
perempuan sepanyol tu kena bunuh teka siapa dia punya suspect
suami si nicole padahal nicole seorang jer kawan dengan dia
pasal si suami nicole tu ada affair dengan si sepanyol ni
tak habis tengok jadi kita tengok sendiri series tu uh pasal tu potong-potong so tak tahu lah apa jadi takde nak kena tengok online ah dia main kat jer so nak kena stream ah
uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just
hey sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing gini
yeah tapi like luckily I got like direct bus ah I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides
yeah macam
like forty minutes then like I was thinking to myself like shall I take a train or what then macam like
suprisingly ada eh cause macam like apa
newton or something then I have to keep like tukar tukar actually no like last year I at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff tapi like
macam so leceh you know like I'm still so
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for yungblud and rex orange county tapi like COVID
mm begitu lah nak buat apa kan
apparently like supposedly my ah first ah music festival lah kirakan so macam like excited kan
habis COVID habis like pun tak boleh masuk I really miss you know I want to go like
you know makan sate malam malam
murah and it's like so nice to
then like she sell err she her husband sold those like bakso cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe dah tutup seh then macam like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like
then ya then anisa pun
I come late also lah cause dia kata dia nak datang pukul tujuh eh tak tak tak dia di
rumah pukul tujuh setengah then sampai pukul
lapan setengah begitu then the end she said because err

macam kan I don't know how it works but maybe ada profile serious how is it
one hour one hour terus dah dapat
I tak perlu upload gambar sendiri
then what if like the person dah kahwin then lepas tu ada masih orang nak try hit on the person
menarik oh god
oh it's like didn't see lah cause like your apa tak nampak apa-apa pun kan
eh then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their halal meter or haram meter thingy
oh cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this halal haram ratio or something
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves ke
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say orang kat Muzmatch macam dia orang serious
ya it does oh ya about apa yang you said
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then macam physical
kan kan tak macam kalau dekat
kalau physical physically macam desperate tapi kalau dalam dating app tak desperate ke
apa-apa lah nak buat apa-apa apa lah apa korang lah
oh so much sia on topic ini
paint tengah picnic oh my god that is so cute
ya oh my god then like the apa
but then macam kalau the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
oh then I will stand up lah try my best to stand up to him then like if macam
dia tak kisah pun like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother lah I will just walk away
wait apa tu catfish
nineteen and this boy sudah gatal
I think I do cerita pasal dating apps or dating
wait cerita netflix oh
dating dating semua
oh kan apa ada some cerita-cerita cinta pasal
where the parents just like apa pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
macam dia orang beli under the fiancee skim thing cepat kan then when I see it I was like ah
nah ah just say they macam I wouldn't want I know that through all these apa
bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab oh multiculturalism at its best
then I saw one uh caption uh bukan caption ah macam post
dia cakap pasal the politics then I think it was about this
uh like it's so sad macam because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
uh kadang dia orang tak sedar diri tau
macam sedih lah macam what can you do also
tak kadang dia orang akan suddenly berbual pasal the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
mm kenapa orang chinese tak percaya ah macam
ya kan orang-orang chinese tak faham lah
then lepas tu dia orang kata apa
hidup dalam susah hati ini dalam negara ini
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like apa macam eh kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur lah sebab
kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
entah lah
kelakar eh tadi berbual pasal dating abeh tak pasal-pasal berbual pasal politics pula
it's just so campur up
ah tak nak
I always stop dekat second around
macam banyaknya rajin budak ni kuasanya rebutan
oh then kita orang sama lah tak tahu lah kalau this time dia orang akan
um accept ke tak we shall see
a'ah that's why like I thought we hari ini nak keluar

ya but now but my apa algorithm is more of ya human babies and cats
ya no but actually banyak seh macam
tak tak hendak tak apa lah just get over eat I just get over eat
other house on TikTok and stuff and they've been doing macam ni
mm mungkin dia orang pun macam nak
ah tapi ada satu macam
macam quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
entah macam ada beberapa challenge
oh tak there is one challenge that I like
is was like um calling my um my girlfriend or wife a third name lah I think that's quite cute actually I like that one but some other challenge macam questionable
tak tak she doesn't follow me anymore yeah tak nak kecoh sia
and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
that macam abeh tengok sunset kalau sunset dia lawa oof lagi best then kita boleh tengok sunset sama-sama
like the whole family tengok sama-sama
then macam at the same time I'm scared like hujan tempias even if there's like shelter ya and confirm mahal seh ya would you want to spend so much
like I want a small majlis jer
tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam baiklah
like I really hope if I end up getting married macam the
okay baiklah itu sahaja yang kita ada untuk hari ini sesi perbualan
dan hazimah
tu lah eh bila eh kita last jumpa each other
oh that time kita
oh apa ni yang
oh ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as jumpa lah because it was on google meet
and I think just because of this recording baru lah kita nak jumpa
kalau tak aku rasa next year baru aku jumpa kau
macam for me leceh seh you know like
for me lah for me like kau nak
like kau nak kena work from home then kau kena go back office might as well just work from home kan because your job pun doesn't really require you to like
you know it's like very easy what you just err turn on your laptop and then duduk depan screen jer
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan
but you know like I feel like I've been err apa ni stress eating tau
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like macam apa um
brody um brody pula err body project
then macam
macam he the guy is very
macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend
eh no but I actually kan aku feel you should like makeover ah your room
no kau kena macam letak dari sana
but what colour was your light macam is it like the macam
but you also bought yang the the stars thingy right the constellation punya lampu
but tak macam
macam mana nak cakap eh macam kau tidur tak tak affected your sleep ke
bila kau nyanyi kan
tahu selalu nampak kau punya story
bila kau tengah aurora tu maknanya kau tengah nyanyi ah
kan kita kindergarten tak sama kan eh no sama
your kindergarten yang dekat sana tu kan
bukan oh your kindergarten kat gek poh
your kindergarten is under the punya kan
sama lah
but mine was like err near the pioneer area sana
or maybe tak lah maybe we met in err primary school
bila eh kita start
it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh

ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
wah kalau gitu ayah kerja lama seh adik tak boleh imagine seh kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years eh ayah kerja dekat alfa laval
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun hais macam tak pernah dengar seh ah
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat uh alfa laval then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning kan dah kan
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu ah
wah kira kan bagus seh pakai allen key jer senang seh
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing kan even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction ah pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
ya ya ya ya actually true ah so macam dia orang ah actually dia orang nak buat kan benda tu ah datang jer kan
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish ah
ayah rasa the houses eh because now they actually want to do a house
ah yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine eh macam the whole building
mm actually kalau macam they use wood kan dia orang cakap ah it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend
dia cakap on construction site kan cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa seh pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction wah bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa a'ah satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no I need to to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start seh
tak cukup ah ah habis dia orang cakap ah they keep saying eh macam oh ah they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
uh still go to the construction site mostly all cannot ah itu dia punya problem ah
ah so ah itu yang I don't know when to finish ah dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen eh
habis kau imagine eh macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance uh tak boleh kan very weird lah dia punya rules
ah tapi tak tahu ah ini bila nak habis kan mm so tengok ah macam mana
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us
uh ya so apa ni executive committee
nicholas aaron khoo macam familiar jer nama tu
last kakak kerja dekat intern twelve cupcakes
um kak kerja as baker um tolong macam
ah kakak dalam err cupcake department macam tolong
apa um ah scoop cupcake better err tolong decoration lepas tu tolong macam taruh
dekat oven ah bakar lah jaga oven semua uh apa kalau ada macam bahan-bahan yang kena refill then akak kena buat
of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
um dekat kerja kakak belajar untuk uh apa selalu ada keyakinan diri um
um saling bantu bantu membantu antara satu sama lain uh haruslah komunikasi sebagai pasukan kerana uh apabila kita err ingin melakukan kerja bekerjasama
kami haruslah berkomunikasi supaya kami tahu uh uh dan dan dan kerja kita akan jalan dengan lancar yup
um kadang-kadang ada jugalah ada ada yang kadang-kadang rasa macam mereka lebih tahu
lebih lebih apa macam mereka lebih tahu lah and then ingin menunjuk-nunjuk
ah tapi ah saya tidak apa ni uh kerana mereka rasa begitu kerana mereka takut um mereka rasa ditepi diketepikan semasa bekerja then ya um tetapi
mereka juga um um ada juga merupa bakat yang sangat bagus lah mereka dah sudah mahir dalam bidang itu ya
um selalunya ada ah contoh seperti kadang-kadang aku terlambat ah masuk kerja ah
ah saya pernah terjatuhkan uh apa ni
terjatuhkan cupcake batter di lantai
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
um yang apa yang saya telah berselerakkan eh apa ni um
saya pun juga pernah tidak mengikut arahan err kerana semasa kawan kerja saya err
ingin ke waktu rehat dia telah mengatakan saya untuk jangan membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven tetapi saya degil then saya tetap uh lakukannya
selepas berapa minit kemudian saya apa uh uh bila saya tengah buat kerja saya masing-masing saya
terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja

eh alah nanti dengar I will say this after the recording ends

ya aku rasa kalau kau ada if you have if you had one superpower I think so it will be will be the world will be fuck because like
imagine kau kau marah kat aku tapi kau tak puas lepas tu seluruh singapore
tapi kau kat dekat sana kau tak puas so instead you go for the whole singapore
and lina pula be like why you doing this who will kill me
apa eh

aku that's why aku no it only show I'm fucking tired
jap aku nak adjust aku punya
the doctor said that because I went to check out from my eyes what the doctor cakap tau apa is because aku rabun too much then the skin is lose then the muscle is weak so what I have to do is
rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
ugh serious nye
appreciation so far macam like Singapore nights festival all this
you're going to say about the penang right the padang kari that we had in Thailand right
oh my god okay jap jap jap
apa eh okay you say yours first ah
bukan kita nak pergi ice skating ke
and leisure park sana
no kita nak pergi bowling ke apa
atas tu ada ada movie
kenapa kenapa lah manis sangat diabetes tau
then kita makan Nandos dekat berjaya time eh
apparently I kena santau
yeah I kena santau abih lepas tu I tak ada mood apparently my mum said I was someone else then I diam je then my mum belikan makan I didn't even touch it I didn't even eat it then mum hold me ah she felt like my body was ice cold
and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong
or macam kari ayam lemak cili api macam this kind of but she never masak any birthday for me then I feel like eh
how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya
then she masak me birthday and then I sakit on that day
okay what how how bodoh is it
if one horse size otter eh that one seram seh
tapi kalau hundred otter size horses
kecil kecil macam miniature gitu
ya ya ya that's true you like tendang tendang tendang then it keeps on coming back
yeah that's true that's true I think ya I think I also ambil the
is macam macam imagine kalau you jumpa lipas abih besar punya ee seram nya tapi tapi like
tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah
ya but if you have to kalau you nak kena pilih satu je
Jollibee atau Arnold's
simple gila dok
ya lepas I think we can we go again
ah belum buka lagi
I think central kot like
ya dia punya fries dia punya cheese tak lokek seh
gila dia punya dia punya cheese
dia punye cause its potato bun
so is different but at the same time macam rasa muak
no lah still can go cuma tak ramai orang ah
my friend semua dah pergi seh this week I see all of them
semua pergi jewel
tak tak ramai but dorang semua pergi pergi jewel
tahu lah you ambil I lah
tak ah kata tu pe dating dating mestilah bawak kena ambil orang must fetch me from one side then must bring cannot complain you know

gila ah
kita pergi kita pack ah
kita kita makan kita pastu kita ciao tempat lain
okay apa
okay okay ah kita berapa lama lagi ni
lagi lima belas minit eh
kena does does it have to be one hour
mm fikir fikir
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your muka haprak but then your personality is nice then okay lah
and if you manage to macam you know capture me with your humor then
topic topic perbincangan
cause yellow is a good energy punya
like you look at yellow then you just like oh you know sedap mata memandang gitu
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
macam like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
and resale and kahwin everything
itu lah you don't have to worry
nanti what if you jadi pervert ke apa
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then macam blackmail them
entah dia macam merepek ah
dia macam world ah I guess
to me dia macam world sikit ah
ya dia macam tak serious come on man you are the avatar man
I rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
for so macam tinggal
tapi monday I have to like upload
I mean macam I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
I don't know how they can just like not explore lah I I like exploring I like to macam
yeah I like to macam
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so macam
cause it's sunday kan
but I feel like this year macam I don't think they they should actually have
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute eh for nurses
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun I macam makan
okay lah is it bubble tea or macam Boost
kan I think so I also prefer Boost
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example macam you pergi interview that time I gi interview then after that I just
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean

hmm biasa biasa biasa ah last time I also like that ah tapi wah sedap [seh]
tu ah like personal experience right then wah every year confirm hor you open your cabinet raya finish already still confirm got a few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth
I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me
you buy the which one I heard the paling trend nya kan is the colour pink tu
yang pearls dia colour pink then when you go Playmade what you drink sia
eh abeh kalau compare kan semua bubble tea kan kau rasa mana satu yang paling mahal
tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it
but I bought also the mochi punya dough the like circle circle tu
uh mochi okay aku Google eh sebab uh kau tahu newt dari TikTok
oo sedap oi
and I was like aku expected it to be sedap ah
yang Dunkin' Donuts tu
aku I was feeling it cause these days I really love like sweets yesterday aku beli apa crepe
punya cake kau pernah rasa crepe cake

halal punya baker
bukan Chateraise um one of those like malay punya J&C ke entah apa

uh so ya I I really like love sweets these days sebab mm aku kan manis

ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving

if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
I saw your posting bro not bad ah kau dengan kau punya baju suit semua very classy eh not bad eh
berapa lama kau kerja sana ah
ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap saudi arabia is a very corrupted country tau
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince kan the prince sulaiman he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries ah have a lot of war and then his ties with the america nya
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic abeh kau bila kau kat saudi arabia selain solat kau buat apa sana
oh so if you were given another chance kau will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try negeri lain
so speaking of football kan abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah stop macam kita orang juga
ah negara luar macam messi ronaldo ni semua kan dorang masih main ke or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
tapi sementara jer bro cause ah
kalau kau tengok betul-betul eh sekarang kau tengok electric punya tariff dah naik nine point three per cent abeh so I think the government will first
for for them lah but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa ninja van eh
oh savings eh tapi slowly your savings will also
jadi kurang kan abeh kau tak worry ah
tak bro that one was just uh interview that I went to went for
um not bad lah you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not aku just try to continue so for now aku just uh aku kerja as a clinic assistant ah
which is quite tough ah banyak patients and
you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
kau ambil train ke kau ambil
bro jangan kuat sangat
ya tak aku ingat kau jalan dengan kat sini
aku mimpi aku pregnant babe then the mimpi was so real is like macam kau tahu bila kau tengah give birth
ya I can feel the pain it's sakit gila babe
ya habis baby tu keluar babe I I don't know who is the father also but ya itu jer lah mimpi aku
err nobody ah it's just me and the baby and some other people that aku tak kenal
dia macam baby biasa I guess like anak perempuan habis cute tapi nakal ah habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu
no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak
and also kau boleh baca quran babe
I can play ah but sikit-sikit jer it's not like mastered level tahu ah

aku tahu float jer
err about james charles dia kan suka nyanyi tapi nyanyi dia macam tak sedap kan so he went to a vocal coach
allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
apasal seh
aku tahu tapi I didn't like
so it's like okay lah kan nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really macam judge too harshly
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah

ya I know lah some of them macam they everytime will find an opportunity to just say eh kat belakang kau ada benda or whatever but I can tell lah that is fake lah
I think I tak tahu lah maybe dia orang gila ah nak attention but then why would you want attention that way

cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my

I know which right now currently sekarang tiktok is doing it
tiktok has a live um ya tapi for one thousand followers and above
not in the future during the future I think it will apa banyak orang akan jual barang dekat tiktok

actually it's true you know because I I don't know why I think it was back I was like really into those yang bikin body bikin body
ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about
the live punya video
apa live video quality I'm not concerned about that that much sebab so far all the phone kalau yang rabak pun dia punya quality is very good I'm concerned about pictures that coming out and gonna post it on my facebook
no lighting is a need as well tapi I really have lighting okay I already have lighting I just need to learn more
eye to see which one is nice which one is not ah you sendiri have to tengok sendiri lah mana satu yang cantik mana satu tak for free
you ingat photoshop senang you ingat photoshop senang
tak kenapa you cakap dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
kenapa you berbual dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek
huh okay part buli in singapore is not that rabak hmm kalau buli in malaysia is the most rabak eh
okay lah let him be lah okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay dah berubah
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at choa chu kang tapi asal I jauh
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier ni pindah for the second year pergi dekat yang college central
hujung sekali kalau kelas you hujung sekali your canteen is hujung sini
to my defense I didn't know sebab bila I uh apa apply for this sekolah dia orang cakap oh this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable wah but when apply kerja horrible
no they do not recognise ah apa private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even kawan-kawan I yang kerja
eh yang
yang apa yang M yang macam you know is private juga kan ataupun apa
entah lah that one private also kan that one also not recognise tau sebab private
tapi is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you korang bagi kerja korang tak nak accept
takde lah
takde lah culinary job is I understand
so I understand that part is like macam okay lah but then
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I bilang
basically alah macam banyak job banyak jer orang yang tak ada kerja but I tak tahu lah maybe I'm looking at the wrong places mungkin my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them macam I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
a'ah like dia cepat-cepat sangat dia progress
ah I'm grateful that we jadi ita tak ke belakang tau jadi kita tak ada slow
future kids you know future grandchildren you know dia orang akan dapat macam a lot of privileges lah and then same time makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi
pintar pintar eh wow bahasa melayu pintar is pintar is pandai lah ya I don't know tiba-tiba
ya lah nak pakai lah ni pandai okay pandai tapi
ya but I'm seriously like grateful lah sebab singapore macam very multiracial multiracial and then macam we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
for me singapore job is ah ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job sebab kena banyak mandarin mandarin kena banyak berbual mandarin then macam
okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam

or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories
alahai dah banyak privilege
lagi people sayanglah aku ni yang kat depan ni sial
mm lepas tu aku gi normal sebab aku boleh sports dalam rumah
it's like you would have like I don't know macam kau ada kan
tak ada script and you have obvious obviously you have a script in front of you you know you would have practice it at home
tak ada ke macam someone like err no one plays sports in the house go normal and
ya tak ada ke like just a
ah of of people's voice actually marwah punya ex ex secretary also so like the moment I heard that I told azmi like alright
yes my vote is not a secret undi awak adalah rahsia
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend
oh yes ahmad is there uh dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada uh think four or five kids
no lah it's okay ah rezeki masing-masing ah so are you not going out with your family today
like kesian kan
bagus lah tu boleh jaga anak-anak
bagus seh masak untuk husband all
ya but ni adalah satu uh precaution for us to take ya so kita perlu berhati-hati lah
so penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah jer
ya lah stress lah at work macam-macam
since it's the holidays kan banyak orang-orang datang uh visit museum
so kalau you nak datang dengan family nak kena datang on weekdays
uh weekend tak boleh lah pasal terlalu ramai
uh until nak queue under the hot sun pengsan pula
um tak ada lah semua kena queue macam biasa
ya so ya lah kind of sad pasal tengah holiday sekarang but we have nowhere to go
oh ya ya I've read about it but belum ada time lah to redeem tour voucher
oh I don't think ada
for kids ada tu vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
online ah so it's not that bad lah hundred dollars pun jadi lah kan
biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
aku tak tahu ah actually I feel like
aku tak tahu mana nak makan sia these days I feel like
oh aku nak cakap dengan kau just now okay so like since last week ah
I aku everyday datang balik sekolah to like do do my work
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then tiba-tiba aku just macam
aku keep telling myself that aku ada banyak masa
then end up like push push everything until macam friday which is the set up day ya then aku last minute rush abeh like
dia dia macam confident gila lah that then she she was proud of her work
then uh all this while she okay lah I can see her effort ah that she did she did put in a lot of effort tapi dia punya dia punya
then dia berbual pasal hijab
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades lah tapi tadi time assessment dia kena buat rabak gila ya
then err because err my work is painting paste dengan aku add four D element which is projector lah then err mm aku aku end up being the last because
I had to set up my mini projector then it's energy saving what so kirakan aku aku end up from register number five to aku jadi last
ya then aku nervous gila ah because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya tapi like aku aku like just macam like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
so dia dia leave lah in the middle of the
the presentation then err mm cause my artwork aku berbual pasal family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya but then but then again right I had another classmate who like
err dia berbual pasal family then dia kena rabak script
lagi pun dia tak ada dia tak ada script
ya dia just berbual kan then she fumbled over her words ya ya
tiga because satu dapat err I don't know why but
err from the start dia cakap dia ada dengue
dia kena dengue then
ya then then he obviously had to stay home lah but it's been like since august sampai sekarang
ya I think he was hospitalized for like a while ni sampai ni dari august tau
ya tapi okay ah class lecturers ya satu presentation jer
but module sama oh what
ya tapi dia orang semua baik ah but
tapi sama sem
kita asyik tukar class
ya then last semester we were doing something else like we we experiment with like two D three D four D ya kau punya is kau terus masuk kau punya ya
uh huh tapi shu dengan naj masih sama class ah
eh cool ke pe

figure drawing at least macam rilek rilek jer
ya tapi ini ini this one is under graphic comm ya lah
ya this time round kau ambil berapa eh oh ya aku kena six sia six credits ya then the the the packaging one was actually four credits and
tapi aku tak nak because it's like four hour class lama gila
asal kau tak ambil yang performing tu sia macam interesting jer
oh jadi macam tak match mismatch gitu lah
next semester kau ada professional development uh so like that course so it helps you like helps you like uh macam choose what ya then at the end of the semester tak salah aku we will have an artist speech
ya then artist speech kan you have to like really go all out for that one minute one minute jer tau kau boleh berbual and then they will invite artist to come then like on the spot if they like you they will hire you ya but I don't think I will get it that's the thing because because class aku ada banyak orang yang stand out
what ours because ours kan you can choose wherever you want to work then like one of my seniors also he he he wants to be a tattoo artist sekarang dia kerja kat tattoo studio ah
uh ya year three sem one but by the time by the time next year kau kena dah ada kerja pe

dapat sia ya lah ya it is ah the thing is okay so so we have to we have to have a spot in a in a in a ya
it depends ah cause like I feel like because like we have to like find ourselves a job ya then tak ada cikgu yang nak tolong kita I feel like I don't know

aku penat gila serious uh how was it
penat gila kan
it's always like that this one is what is a mall I mean like it's a stall right a'ah ah bukan kau ambil temperature
so what position is it now promoter huh so so sekarang kerja kau buat apa
then then how did you say you wanna quit kau cakap apa orh abeh abeh apa uh paid pula

is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship
wow ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
is it tak tahu lah sekali five hundred juga eh
ah then go ahead bro ambil jer
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar what I'm not so
no need lah ah now I'm like thinking nak ambil ke tak ah tapi tak apa lah no need ah
ya I'm thinking of that lah but tengok ah
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving
tapi nak kena tengok juga jangan potong too close
apa semua nak kena ada allowance
so I think it got a bit derailed sebab exam kan banyak focus dekat exam so dah tak fikir sangat lah like I think
ya so I think maybe selepas
yes selepas exam maybe dapat masuk balik lah then
ya tapi bila buat sendiri is tak as senang as dia tunjuk
ya memang banyak video tetapi I underestimate how
mm I thought is macam yang
speaking of I think my kawan-kawan are planning like a dinner or something
uh tak dah bangun selepas itu tertidur tapi bangun balik dah macam terlajak
mm tengok cerita incredible tales
tapi cikgu itu forgiving lah dia cakap okay tak apa lah it's late but I will mark as present
mmhmm apa dia
err ya I agree as well belum buat banyak pun macam uh
nanti dah tak ada moral lah
ya tapi bunuh satu pun dah macam mana
otter satu biasa pun dah besar macam mana
okay lah at least dah tahu lah apa nak cakap
for me kerja dekat bakery pun masih ya allah pun masih boleh can

bila dah hidup sendiri kan tak akan ambil
mm tetapi kalau fikir balik kan if you're not there at home is
what's the point and ya menyeksa lagi ada

no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge

so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or

then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa

we watched that so many times and I still cry tu so sekarang I'm watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
um ah there's dia ada reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety eh nineteen eighty eight

ya I I tahu tapi from what I read is
orang clone so they tapi dia ingat macam oh this is actually the person tapi actually bukan
of the people in the past something like that macam gitu err jadi
tak tau lah
dah habis film sekarang ah
sekarang tinggal production lambat saje keluar pasal
dia dia orang tengah kira-kira pros and cons of
yes so they dia orang takut impact
mm video on demand ke apa
lagi apa ya lah Netflix ke apa all those kan
games movies ada you bayar untuk
something like dia orang ada
they don't have the new movies belum lagi berani lah go into this
but you those not produce by Netflix is those produced by Warner Brothers the they dia orang masih belum berani untuk
macam tu kalau this one keluar movies
orang orang bayar untuk subscribe to Netflix to watch their movie
dia punya tu advertisements semua
kalau dia orang buat letak kat tu people will unknowingly buy it mah
nak beli juga I
nak beli juga or maybe some merchandise or or apa I beli juga
bukan tu jer yang dia orang look for they look for streams they look for
err people new subscribers masuk people who
upgrade akaun dia orang
boleh tengok to
three people or five people family punya account ah that's how they make the money
and also from the advertisement lah because for every movie mesti ada the sponsors siapa masuk
nak macam let's say Nike wants to be in in
ya lah macam gitu dia orang buat duit
dia promise
ya maybe dia dah promise
for like maybe dia nak tunjuk satu kopi
where your coffee maker say for every minute that you show me I will they will bayar a certain amount

ah ya takpe ah
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad

aku would want to be invisible
eh bocui sia nah tak payah tak payah we don't snitch
but what about kau
eh by the way kau watch uh umbrella academy
aku rasa they talking about like
kau tahu like
but it's like a natural thing ah for kau kan and some it's honestly called talent ah to be that smart at that young age
yes correct ah betul
so in a way pun kau like grateful lah for what has happened because it made you too because
a'ah overrated pun
aku still wouldn't hear it lah to be honest cause
but also don't need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
if kau realise
eh I wanted to join eh come on lah aku nak join sia
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat Singapore kan kitanya country small
oh mak yes
low-key kalau ada ah eh
but kau imagine though
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree
work is a an activity apa
ah we can call it a food lah that I know you won't be jelak of is sweets lah
because normal lah everytime aku nampak kau selalu makan gula selalu makan gula ada benda ah kat dalam mulut kau selalu
K kau rindu sekolah sangat ke huh
standard confirm oh yang that sebelah drink store that western the burger
betul lah betul lah cause before you eat with your mouth you eat with your eyes ah they say
but here's another thing though aku nak kena tanya kau
takde no such thing
dia kau dah check up
awal pe
ya I know aku dari tadi nampak ah so that's why but it's okay understandable
so kau boleh cakap dengan diri kau macam
takde I cannot
just a little bit just a little bit eh perang ah just a little bit jer
head ah kirakan head of department
but I mean actually not that bad especially yang that time ah
aku dengan cyprus kena caught kena kat toilet
err suruh jumpa miss tan mister adrian and that time mister adrian was a ah
then dia cakap dengan aku pasal all these actions
then dia cakap dengan aku oh your punishment is going to be you have to go to
no thank god he he just he just then I'm like eh serious ah aku stress sia twenty twenty class what the fuck
mmhmm eh macam tahu jer not bad macam tahu jer
ah a'ah sia lagi lagi NITEC let's be honest ah NITEC has more girls that higher NITEC that's a fact
ah sorry ada orang ada girlfriend takpe takpe takpe
I mean in a way kau boleh train kan that shit too
oh like macam straight away not bad
not only macam pasal discount price and shit cause
ah apa lagi soalan kau tengah tengok ni
dia ada berapa soalan sia
yeah that few is berapa lah
aku definitely heard of the word
apa ah
macam detective ah aku ingat aku ingat
but honestly ah aku like just like that ah the aircon on the bus
sekarang most to most yang buat joke is
aku lah
ah susah sia
okay ah but I understand uh pun kau have your own things going and you know I wish you well and shit lah
no the best time was when we were year one kat J seven
uh kau setakat kat belakang I don't know why you looking at fish hooks and okay lah that guy interested
ah ah aku masih ingat
but if I had known earlier that kau akan like you know quit soon
I mean aku understand lah aku understand
oh merepek
ah yes oh my god kau
that's why aku agree ah with kau on that
you are better off now kau tengah buat what kau love honestly we still keep in contact so that's also good lah
kau wait ah kau tunggu aku I think I got told you this before bila aku ada motor aku datang situ kalau tak kita lek lek jap
uh tak aku kalau lagi four more
tapi takpe kau tunggu jer
ah boleh boleh enjoy that's that's my main goal lah to be honest lah eh
ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi
tu ah
now she take lesser naps tau macam she can stay awake for longer time cause she's like almost two months already I can chill I can chill
mm the other night I didn't I didn't I I lambat change her ni kan change her diaper wah she melalak like kena pukul seh she rimas
aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct
but it's funny because I I do your right side more than your left side you know cause I cause tadi I put like that right then you see so fast ya then this side yang tak then this side I've been doing like I'm very careful
she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg
cause the other side also hari tu sakit tapi orh this one more painful
that time sakit dua-dua tapi this one the left side is more painful
then I was like ni siapa seh at first I saw the name lah but the name kan bukan aiman dia letak dia letak is it aiman instagram
oh he put aim E S R eh aim nama
ya lah aim nama dia apa aiman amsar eh ah
mana dia dapat that idea you should ask a'ah as in aiman aiman jer lah then suddenly the mother put aisar oh adik dia adik dia apa
a'ah ya ah semalam I heard you talk to shakirah pasal nama why ah like suddenly you you say macam dulu her name is aura nur sofia about her
mata dia gini jap lagi nak mandi dah tidur lah pula
aiyo nanti she cannot fit some of her pampers dah tak boleh fit dah masuk S oh ya I don't know whether you know kasi baby punya susu macam mana like how the increase right but I read at the tin kan eight weeks to twelve weeks sekarang kena kasi hundred fifty seh
then I like hundred fifty hundred fifty is this full you know satu is it okay
then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay
I'm going to make like that if not you tak habis susu wasted wasted wasted
masih ah daripada semalam does it really look swollen ya slightly ya slightly yes
nanti ah nanti lah
mm dia yang respond
boleh nampak ke oh it's so dark right now my eyes are so painful
since yo are there on lampu sekali lah on lampu sekali
the cake apa seh

nanti ah nanti tanya bapak uh I think he he save a voucher or what
but for me I I use only macam about ten gitu lah
ah tak banyak ah ah
phone ni six S plus ah I think since um which year ah since twenty sixteen uh remember that time we go which wedding ah medan ah medan ingat

no I mean uh bukan yang bukan tau the the one at uh what you call that
that one you that one tak boleh search apa online
um tak
yesterday there's ada satu interview eh recruiter kan
what's the word ah macam
like you know like you ask them to call back kan abeh dia cakap ah no only two minutes macam a bit annoying ah you know
orang melayu cakap um jangan apa
most of the job dia orang cakap aiya it's like contract it's not really ah
that is that makes sense what kalau tak nobody will also macam
full time but because sekarang kan I teach tuition kan
no but tuition only left lagi dua bulan ah until um october kan O level atau N level kan
last week I just start um this new student ah budak melayu ah budak apa N level ah N level dekat bukit batok
no I think now they they make more centres ah I think they I think dia orang there's no way they can do in a big hall what kan
then yang students yang lain all pergi normal classroom ah
I think same time ah the the whole singapore mesti same time what kalau tak later how to know that you know
I think part time got got a a lot job ah macam yang this um
kat mana eh um
for part time mesti commit
for me best is um data analsyt atau business analyst
atau system analyst ah
kena twenty four seven support
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
I think python macam python for me is okay lah because it's a
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable kan so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
ah there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya C hash eh apa C hash eh is it
but it's um the pace is what like dia ikut which um which language
I don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
ingat tak um during the year twenty
my job mostly like ah then investigate ah gitu
ah error error dia akan email kan so times ten kan times ten
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the I really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone ah
the like not say down time ah macam
nenek boleh pergi balik ah nenek
um I think tak boleh ah but eh but dia right yang syakilah iman is maybe ah I think
eh I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think berlambak ah mail dia
no ah oh auntie I always just say cik cik rozi ah cakap something ah
then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
okay okay hello me okay berbual berbual okay hi

okay kalau umi tukar conversion dah seribu lebih lah then
um ya but umi kena consistent ah umi post video like hari-hari post video every two days you just post tengok um just keep posting and then ya that is youtube kalau facebook pun boleh buat tapi facebook is like facebook facebook bagus untuk orang ngaji-ngaji pasal banyak orang tua tengok kan
um for dia kalau depends on the view kalau bulan bulan ni boleh dapat seribu lebih lah pasal this

tak okay lah  nak cakap senang
hantar makanan hantar makanan tu apa no lah umi umi kena
ya yang K yang ini untuk makanan jer ni memang khas untuk makanan jer channel ni dia takde post apa-apa lagi selain makanan jer orang makan because pasal kalau umi buat satu channel umi tak boleh campur-campur
pasal kadang-kadang orang suka tengok ngaji tengok ngaji jer you know what I mean umi kalau nak umi tak nak kalau selain melainkan kalau umi dato aliff ke dato vida nak tunjuk kehidupan takde orang kisah pasal umi kehidupan
so kalau umi nak buat channel umi buat satu satu topic tu satu niche umi boleh buat macam kesihatan ada orang buat macam err buat duit anything lah okay lah okay contoh eh contoh contoh let's just pakai contoh orang lain
okay um kita tengok channel channel orang lain eh kita tengok berapa banyak dia buat okay contoh um channel siapa siapa yang ustaz ustaz apa ustaz kazim
kazim kan kasim ke kazim eh okay ustaz kazim kazim okay um
ustaz kazim okay lah tak tahu nama dia siapa how to spell
K A Z I M okay ustaz kazim tak tahu lah dia ada channel ke tak kita tengok okay dia ada channel ustaz okay jap
channel ustaz kazim jadi satu website dia boleh macam anggarkan tau berapa dia dapat
oh tapi dia tak dapat oh ni bukan channel dia ni bukan channel dia
ini bukan channel dia ni ni macam channel orang buat jer
okay lah kita tengok kita tengok channel yang betul-betul ada orang buat eh ustaz ustaz ebit ah
ustaz ni banyak orang tahu kan ustaz ni popular sikit okay ebit liew eh terpicit dia ada lima puluh
okay jap eh kita tengok dia ada lima puluh ribu juta view gitu dia punya langganan ada lapan ratus umi umi check umi punya recording is it still masih record
okay lapan ratus enam puluh satu ribu kan subscriber
okay okay lah ni ni anggaran jer dia buat dalam three point two K per month okay tapi the thing is benda ni kadang-kadang dia anggarkan jer it might not be true macam sometimes dia boleh buat lagi banyak lah you don't know okay lah let's tengok macam channel um celebrity eh
siapa ah siapa yang buat channel err okay lah aliff aliff syukri okay dia suka buat youtube kan
okay jer bonda rozita
um ni bumi ratu channel okay ni jer
okay dia buat dalam empat ribu lima ribu lah okay per month
ya ini channel dia okay dia pun channel dia um bonda whatever
K ni tak banyak ni channel dia ke nine dollar jer sembilan dollar I don't know maybe bukan okay tengok aliff syukri aliff syukri dia banyak buat crap I'm not supposed to type
anak dia lah
aliff aliff boleh kita boleh cakap crack lah umi tak kisah
dia orang tak tahu okay not
okay err kan dia okay terlajak laris ni dia banyak tau dia punya
okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok eh dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih ah video dia dia dia naik kan okay um and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama kan banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that
lepas tu ya lah that that's what you can do and then you can do a lot of things

tapi like circuit breaker tak boleh keluar rumah pun private how to say
kat rumah masak jer
I still go out quite a couple of time lah pasal kerja
apa eh aku masak
like the only memory I have is aku punya adik tiba-tiba cakap nak
buat macaron macam
as for me aku ada bake ah I still got bake at home with my nenek
tapi aku punya adik like don't really bake abeh tiba-tiba you want to start then you start with the hardest thing you can think of aku ingat siapa punya birthday eh aku punya maknya birthday eh
then macam dia nya plan macam fail tau dorang buat macam first batch macam tak jadi
then uh simpan dalam fridge sekejap
abeh second batch pun macam tak jadi
the capsule ah ya that one susah
like the apa ni dia nya height
abeh then you need to like coat it
oh a'ah korang exam
okay ah tapi like the past mm dua minggu tiga minggu macam kat rumah kat dalam bilik macam
dekat mana eh dekat rumah chloe eh
alah dorang dua neighbour
aku pergi sana end up aku masak mac and cheese
abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya coffee
susah kan
tak tahu cukup bro
like I didn't cook a lot macam I cook a bit just for myself just to see apa ni
whether it's good or not lah like the combination tapi macam all four macam not that
berapa banyak then the low heat
tapi yang actually susah singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
the slice punya ah abeh the third one I went to
aku tak ingat ah aku beli Cold Storage kat kedai tu ah yang Cold Storage yang Fairprice Finest tu
dia ada aku beli jer ah
confirm I cannot remember nya
korang masak like during is like not really
masakan melayu kind
so that time I tried my nenek then I just ask
what was it ah some sambal
can't remember I think was like ayam masak merah
then end up the only thing yang aku ingat kan is like there already aku masak tom yum nasi goreng tom yum seh
like korang korang masak is like
like ikut measurement berapa sudu all those kind of thing
then when my nenek masak then she ajar right then she just like oh ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit then I macam stress sia I don't even remember what is sikit what is banyak
that's why part ramadhan susah nak masak
so end up macam nak masak sayur pun depends on the age of the sayur that kind of hing
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the orang tua tengok
I don't know lah my datuk nenek always watching lah
but is not macam it's not macam Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
ya like bring back the last time lah like hady mirza menang pe Gegar Vaganza that time
I never show you meh yang hady mirza nya
uh cinta luar biasa
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw dia nya starting that was his like second or third episode
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza pasal like
that's why end up before that also dia buat macam
belum lagi early bro
then I will wait there duduk depan then dengan phone is like mana akid I just press record
ah dia nya kakaknya wedding ah
tak ada lah
cause dia nya cake was from my shop
aku ambil dia nya cake then I took Grab then I go there to her house ah
I think initially dorang buat they were looking at hotel tu semua
went on with it ah kat rumah but okay ah
okay lah but I never actually ask how much they spend that time aku punya kawan pun kahwin
then I think dia nya masak pun is dorang masak sendiri
dorang tak order cater tak I don't think is cater that wasn't cater pasal tak banyak orang datang
like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends dah tu jer then her bridesmaids lah
so it's like even as the bride herself dia tak invite banyak orang
okay ah but now banyak dorang
as in the company dorang buat is like cater hantar rumah pe
like the thing like that like that that time that mariam punya mak
with some you know the you remember the the the link that afiq sent to the silat group
about some gym bag yang you can sign up
tapi nak cakap apa eh
melayu aku err melayu aku melayu aku sekarang pun aku sekarang tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual
oh okay okay saya faham saya faham
it's just quite funny then wah my cat just manja like you know no tomorrow you know
okay but you know esok I tomorrow I have a meeting again
no not silat only I responded sia
cause I cause I'm reading the mail now apa
ya lah memang bukan main-main tapi afiq ada cakap pasal err kan syaz dapat kerja baru then syaz ah dia cakap macam aku boleh rasa afiq dah tak ikhlas sekarang
no tapi so aku tanya dia like kenapa dia err
okay so like I ask afiq like why he keep why does he keep holding this on macam for so long then he said that uh because syaz just got a new job then he doesn't want to err like ruin her spirit ah or something like that I don't know then I'm like that's damn that's damn bastard lah serious like damn bastard
I don't know I think they wanted to go out makan or something and then like they wanted to like because amar didn't want to be like so exclusive then he wanted to invite the two of us
because we have to keep we have to fill up the one hour usually when we talk we don't fill it up what it's like kita ada we have blanks you know
so amacam eh amacam so how
faham tapi itu so basikal bapa dia apa
ah takkan faz minta izin bapa dia habis bapa dia tak boleh ikut
ugh kenapa
apa yang okay
tapi kita nak berbual pasal apa eh
apa just just ini cakap nak berbual
apa yang kau merepek eh
eh kau punya melayu rabak juga eh
kau just just berhenti bercakap okay apa kamu
tapi aku dah lama tak berbual melayu macam gini ah so susah juga ah
kau nak kau nak kau asyik berbual bahasa baku jer that's why kekok
tercakap bahasa inggeris ah
memusnahkan recording ini recording dalam bahasa melayu apa
so kita sekarang tengah merakam pe
kenapa dah lama tahu bahasa melayu kan jadi macam gini
yang tertiba okay okay aku faham aku faham
err aku just tak faham ah kau nak cakap apa eh
dulu kita err apa eh
apa yang kau tengah berbual eh
ya allah susah
kenapa kau kena pakai saya awak ini ah
oh gitu
okay jadi kita nak berbual pasal apa sekarang
boleh juga lah kita buat gitu
kau asyik cakap benda just
kenapa eh
aku rasa tak ah
tapi sekarang ini kita speak in full sentences ke
ah okay ah macam gitu ah
dude your oh my god your malay sounds so kekok
kenapa eh
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
um wow that sounds great aku past few days aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah jer tengok
janganlah kita buang duit nak beli handphone yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada lah beza sangat dengan handphone yang lama kan
mostly kalau aku boleh mimpi lah satu hari healthcare percuma lah untuk semua orang
susah kan dia orang nak afford untuk bayar dia orang punya hospital bills kan
nenek saya pun masuk hospital pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh
pun tak murah lah kan nak bayar dia punya itu
um obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future kita boleh hilangkan diri eh in a way that
kalau aku pun aku memang nak lah sebab macam dia kata kalau during exams kalau lah masa O level aku boleh baca minda orang eh yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya results lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke
ya betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan lah kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu lah kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
yang pertama if kalau boleh aku nak
dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia lah sebab pertama sekali um daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh err nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
bahasa german dengan italian
aku kalau boleh lah kalau dapat lah nak cuba
um master lah dengan beberapa cepat lah yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak
um belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik
macam faidil kata tadi dia boleh look up to orang macam gordon ramsay yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak
ikut lah gordon ramsay kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan
kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita so
mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya lah dapat senangkan untuk semua orang
movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon
tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat tiga ke malaysia astro ke dapat tengok
kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar lah tapi
memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye

then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh
yang wave wave pool the big one
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power
no longkang longkang yang jalan sendiri lazy pool
ah longkang longkang
and the actual olympic punya swimming
you you try move your apa ni paket you taruh depan you
pasal kalau you tengok you punya sound wave kan dia macam when you kill let's say
grey tuan
oh cause my one dia gerak banyak seh maybe because my voice is loud ah
okay okay you see ah my my wave besar tahu
I I jauh begini pun boleh dengar
there was this one girl yang
I was with macam sama sekolah
so kita just grow like from nursery K one eh
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever kan sampai P six
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik kan adik dia lah
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu jer lah tapi
it was just like macam
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
bila primary six
kan then I tak tahu kenapa ah
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah eh wait eh belum habis eh jap
ya so macam uh apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
macam cute kan P six
eh eh eh eh dia ni
ni what do you mean by you like the person you like err you eh
I thought eh sia ah dini gerek sia kalau dengan dia pun best
but I think I think my one is amplified eh like berbual
tak pasal I berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like
you know there's in a group there's that one that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay lah kita gini ah then everyone macam okay ah go ah no problem macam yes
actually when the robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot dengan dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
so ya there's leader ni
actually just just two people tahu
so macam let's say okay
so everywhere they go kan ah okay lah jom ah like then okay lah pergi makan ah okay lah jom ah jom ah main bola ah
okay okay lah go ah that kind of ya so macam primary school what I did was
P one P two begitu
yang tapi yang ah
yang indian uncle under your block

okay P one P two I always go home so like one forty five habis kan so one forty five
uh primary school lah the those macam textbook and workbook
in textbook is macam
they teach you then there's fill in the blank punya itu eh
so there's this one point of time during my primary three kan I just got bored of this at the speed yang the teacher was teaching
so then that time I don't know if your your time masih ada lah tapi my time ada macam
ya so that time A kan when dia baru habis macam
basically chapter ke two chapter of that activity book I dah habis the whole book

ya it was from the eighth level eh nak campak bawah
and the thing is kan yang kat bawah kan the like
yang public punya I don't know it was raining or not I don't think it wasn't ah that's why they panic
so badminton court kan usually this timing macam ramai kan like these days kan cause they cannot go macam indoor so they just play at those
neighbourhood punya badminton kan
then ahmad naik dengan botol
I think macam sama ah ya
cause secondary school was where macam

every time oh just like that gitu gitu gitu pass belakang gitu dah
then at at one point tahu kita

oh duit kan ya ya ya ya ya
I help them count the duit dekat apa ni coin coin kat dalam kelas
at the class ya during class kan habis
I don't know why at that point of time I had to go inside the class and teman
err gitu I cakap eh you check how much money you have
check how much money you have nanti dia later got I remember seh this scene
they just take out dia orang punya wallet just put all the coin on the table
okay you got this one you want to eat what today then I cakap ah
eh my buddy like dia macam senang nangis like err easy to cry
I realise cause that primary one I kat sekolah lama kan
dia macam cool tahu macam gangster gangster semua macam err
then I macam okay ah mampus ah
I macam tak nangis I was just clueless
I didn't cry I was just clueless I macam more of like err was apa ni
err shocked at the atmosphere ah then macam cool lah
tapi in primary school you get to move around
kalau your class also lain macam malay class you have to go somewhere else right
ya have you ever received homework macam okay
you tengah belajar kan then tiba tiba the teacher say
then we like okay lah baik ah three question
then question two pun sama question three pun sama pernah
I legit boleh gaduh seh dengan cikgu
I pernah gaduh tak tak macam awak
err sorry for the red lines again okay you know you know I pernah ah
then gitu gitu then I was joking around I was laughing at my friend's joke
then my laugh kan okay you usually tahu lah kan my laugh is like loud
okay then I I laugh laugh laugh kan then I kena scold dia cakap
why you laughing ah you got listening to me or not macam this kind of typical
gitu habis dia cakap I want you to answer
that time it was science punya tissue punya topic
dia cakap okay zai what can you tell me about the tissues in our body
cakap huh teacher why why why why tissue go toilet ah take tissue
so I pergi I went to staff room
he he I ingat ah apa lah kena marah or what lah
he terus masuk his his desk take his phone
ah dia macam
ya habis dia cakap no no no I want you to call you've been disturbing my class
habis I macam
before I kena marah because I laugh
okay then I cakap err okay lah okay lah let me call
cause I I had to call I had to talk to my father first what before I give my phone so I cakap uh assalamualaikum ya
I at work eh ah ni my teacher want to talk ah I I laugh in class then then err
apa lagi lah janaz okay okay okay
then kita berbual berbual berbual berbual lah then after that
bual bual bual bual bual bual kan
then dah berbual then my my dad want to talk to me again so my the mister tan give back the phone
then I laugh back lah he was like ha ha kenapa lah buat joke macam gitu
ni merepek jer something like that then I macam tak tahu I I then I was just laughing ah then the mister tan was just looking at me eh weirdly tahu
so I I think in his head lah pasal apa seh dia ni tengah apa tengah ketawa
dia cakap okay okay okay nevermind ah you just you you don't you don't so loud ah you just pay attention in class ah then I was like okay okay okay then hang up
then I masuk class kan semua tanya ah I remember seh
tengok eh what did you do
ya that's why macam tak kena
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything
tapi before the ending you all go around each table ambil gambar with everybody ah
okay jadi
hello hi so kita nak start buat err recording
other than that semalam you cakap
err arab street nak top up your stock jadi pergi
tak tak ada tanya never err call you is it
later the nadia punya do you need to ask anything else

and you know we we've got these we've got these dia macam kau macam you just look at this guy
and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu
aiya the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called eh yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
tak lah serious
ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those
standard pokok I don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
the youngest means macam early twenties twenty two ah wow I feel old now
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ
wait your house is dekat fuchun fuchun primary baru ke fuchun primary lama is it near marsiling primary
ya ya ya ya I know mm you know what is keras right one look you know that is keras
I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
ya because zaman tu right zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah and masak
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like

yeah I stopped at like episode seven then I just baca the synopsis online
yeah that's why it's I want to love it so much but oh cannot err cannot tak boleh tahan
err eh is it ah ah ke dalam pukul dua gitu gitu check-in
eh tak lah wah we play mm wah that was the first time my layang-layang flied so high eh it was like wow
think we checked-in then we what did we have ah I cannot remember apa kita makan kat sana I think oh you know before that right kita pergi Arab Street makan dekat this place near Masjid Sultan
I think it's called err ape minang kah ape I can't remember the name
like um the minang err the cuisine name
no eh it was cheap like it was considered macam atas street food
but wah the food was so good until now I'm thinking about dia punya tahu telur wah sedap oof
yeah then we wah we nasib baik ah kita dapat err swimming slot for both for all three days
oh tu tak tau but I know they have like satu jam punya slot habis tu thirty minutes for cleaning
oh no no like we boleh masuk untuk satu jam habis tu before the next slot they will clean for thirty minutes then there is a next slot
yeah we lucky lah cause some people tak dapat so yeah
err oh the last day kita pergi right we went at err I think lapan setengah pagi habis tu hujan
tak ah mandi aja lah
sejuk ah
no err hari kedua we went to ape tu Garden By The Bay
yeah masuk dalam
okay lah I will lagi
tak eh cause they limit the occupancy
and I'm like wah tak banyak orang
uh tu pun pergi boring seh pergi banyak kali
err cause is like if not for this situation kita pun tak pergi nya cause mahal seh on normal days
I think around there kat sana tu
wanted to have like graduation staycay also tak dapat seh
uh tak dapat reply nak buat ape
wah actually dia punya shift panjang seh
belum the result only coming out err bulan depan there yeah
yeah my siblings say I'm a bum a home bum so I'm like okay tu pun jadi lah
yeah I mean some of the requirements also I don't meet lah macam what ada kan diploma lah atau experience lah then I'm like I don't have any
uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
I'm going to be wearing this nonya kebaya lah it's pink and it's gold
tapi bawah dia actually is kain daripada indonesia dia javanese punya batik ah
tak lah kawan aku cakap dia beli murah jer kat indonesia she said you can get like cheaper things in indonesia macam kalau kau nak buat kebaya-kebaya semua just buat kat sana
no kita just
kita just kena pretend ah macam this conversation ah kita boleh tukar-tukar background kau nak pergi paris kita boleh tukar pergi paris
boleh lah kita just tukar nama dia orang as A dengan B
habis begitu jer ah
kau kan gemini moon
bila aku single
sekarang aku tak boleh tak boleh gila-gila sangat doh
oh my god did I tell you ex aku tulis surat kat aku lagi
aku delete ah lepas tu aku deleted the the surat
I got the notification ah so out of curiosity I went to go and read it then when I read it I'm like eh aku seriously just eh
aku tak sabar nak makan nasi pengantin on sunday

aku just malas like what is the point of you telling me this ah like
kau just boleh ah like pretend that nothing happened like
bila kau beli rokok dia orang tak minta ke
bodoh nak jer cuci mata dia ni
that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya

we are going to entah
I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast dah ada
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that lah so
then he was okay he he still can layan okay ten thirty aku tak bangun kadang-kadang I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then ah because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay lah my alarm ten thirty uh no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep lah bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because kau orang pemalas
I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he makan lunch already he go back to office
with andre I'm thinking whether I should get him a batik shirt ah to match me but kedai mana ada jual sekarang

cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or tangs I think and then I was thinking okay by the time kita habis we will probably be eating dinner
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking kalau dia orang buka pagi then I can go and buy first
and then harap-harap ah dia boleh muat
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got baju that will match that colour dia ada baju yang boleh match ni
he will eat lah he will eat he he he likes food in general babe dia tak picky when it comes to makan dia tak picky like even when you spicy like deepavali aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk

I know little should be near little india punya station
what else I was thinking like bring like um sportswear macam I want to go to the gym
feeling jer aku eh I think so like usually
oh okay I will Google aku dah macam wah ni kalau nak maximise apa lagi aku boleh ni eh buat kat hotel ni selain swimming
weh carpet buat apa
kita kena fikir tau tiga orang nak tidur kita kena tidur macam gini melintang
aku rasa ah
aku rasa ah tak nak lah extra bedding tak payah lah untuk satu malam jer
kau takde kau benda-benda gini kan ada
abang kau lagi lah
aku rasa macam abang aku ada nanti aku tengok eh kalau ada
tapi sleeping bag eh tapi kita tiga orang aku rasa aku minta
tak okay katil
that was you you are being told to sleep there kita takkan suruh kau tidur situ the three of us sleep on the bed but if let's say the bed is a king besar right then we
we tidur macam
macam mana uh kita tidur melintang
means kita tak kita tak tak ikut cara
boleh eh aku pernah buat aku nenek aku dan kakak aku pergi holiday kita
kau jangan aku tak suruh kau tidur dekat bench aiyo
a'ah betul tak payah fikir banyak-banyak eh
actually aku tak tahu kau cakap apa tadi aku cakap jer
tapi tapi tu kau kena bawa as in the hassle is we have to be
okay I I think you can get at nanti aku tag but I don't know when I'm going
maybe Daiso punya is for
oh because I know that it the trend is macam you know like like baru-baru ni ah orang baru nak cycling
ni pasal ah
okay lah ini semua pasal COVID lah orang semua
cari cari apa kegiatan eh
kegiatan eh
ah riadah seh
eh uh apa tu ah next year ah we do something
actually I'm supposed to go out just now to collect something then I tell the person can I come tomorrow instead cause like I saw the it's scorching hot then I was like ah apa aku boleh buat productive hari ni okay kemas bilik
tak sweater lah this is this is not sweater this is
no it's tak tebal it is tak tebal
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around

pergi sana beratur going there

sekarang apa stadium pun dah dibuat baru very macam high technology it can it can actually consist of banyak
uh apa uh spectators you know fifty sixty sixty thousand so
with apa the ability to macam so much apa
ah apa ah the good facility why can't we revive the apa

tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan

bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke

okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
no tak payah lah just stop jer
I don't know ugh I I don't have access to the the Whatsapp right now kejap eh
and then she jeling at me
it's called sekali gus
ya because if a goose goes out and buy things and carry everything in one trip it's called sekali gus
I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti
a'ah during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also nakal ah but the girl quite angel ah tapi macam devil lah kan but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible lah

I rasa macam
so so they they drove back home dia naik naik kereta balik ke mana
rumah dia kat mana lah
tapi is that macam intentionally or
so dia tak
you tahu tak yang like
crazy lah macam it's a wild thing but then
budak-budak ni semua belajar dari mak bapa dorang pe
so kalau dorang kurang ajar dengan mak bapa dorang sendiri
anak dorang confirm ikut punya
tak akan lah anak tak sayang mak bapa
memang lah
tapi sedih tau like I see my parents kalau dorang
dia kan tinggal sorang
hope yang kadang-kadang dia tinggal dengan kita instead lah macam
she's alone dia sorang-sorang kat rumah
so if anything happens siapa nak jagakan dia seh
telephone dia ask her how is she all these like
quite old already kaki sakit
dari dulu tau dari kecil dia kata

some more she stay alone tak akan lah want to work so hard also
nobody's taking care of her lah like bills semua
like kita punya families semua jaga kan
and from bills electricity bills kita pun bayar apa
kalau you kan
if you dah tua
dah ada duit tu semua kan
you nak pergi mana
ada tak tempat yang you nak
or attractions tapi jangan lah tua sangat ke macam like forty ke
bila I pergi kan
tembok tu cantik tau
the culture there is different okay lah dorang racists from what I heard
they are racists tapi macam their culture like how they move is like very free
the tembok tembok tembok bricks
tak faham lah tapi macam
tapi like
ada lagi ramai orang tua dari orang muda kan
um this orang-orang tua semua ni kan kena kerja keras pasal
like tengok
family dengan lima anak
abeh I pun macam tertanya tau macam
ah even the government helping them pasal macam like you can see tau macam
tak tahu family planning ke apa
like okay maybe they they love kids dorang sayangkan anak-anak
kids tapi
it seems very chaotic macam dorang tak tentu arah
dorang betul-betul suka lah anak-anak semua
but then not so big lah tak nak besar sangat
nanti siapa nak jaga seh nak kerja habis tu nak kena
I tak boleh masak I tak boleh

I nak
cause a snowball effect to tau tu pasal I
dapat degree
pasal I see all my friends
kawan-kawan kan
semua dah habis degree tau
you nak tahu tahu you tahu tak
I malam-malam kan
kadang-kadang I fikir tau
kenapa I ambil

didn't do anything I tunggukan boyfriend jer
I betul-betul harap
dorang accept I
pasal kan
I know it's gonna be tough tapi
I kena cuba
like if not now bila
I perlukan pertolongan lah in that area
marketing is on demand tu pasal lah susah nak cari kerja
tu lah kerja I dulu
betul you know like
pasal kita nak experiences kan they think they don't really take us
tapi actually I think yang if it is a very good
pasal if
tapi did you know that I mention
like I kata tadi like
even intern job dorang minta experiences
that is the funny part to me lah pasal dorang nak experiences tapi
they ask so you boleh imagine tak like
tapi you gotta
you gotta work hard for it lah macam
that's a very good question actually tapi kan talking about movies
you want a genre yang you suka tak
I suka
perlukan itu lah bantal
untuk cover muka

the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like

uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that
it's a funny show ya it's comedy it's like eh dia nya genre is like comedy

um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right

so I nak kena cari
uh)<malay>baju-baju yang macam like that I would wear
for ya so I thought okay you know what I don't wear like baju kurung I'm going to wear I'm going to specifically choose kurta
okay jadi kurta ni dia macam
it's very hard to find kurta dekat mana like to find where kurta is
ya so we went I don't know why but we decided tekka tekka confirm ada kurta
so but there was there's a lot of like err you know like indian wedding costume which is like lawa gila but ya oh ya that's true so so we found like a cheap one cause like I I macam I felt that it was err the first one that we tried was macam dia macam forty dollars
and lepas tu ya and then lepas tu kita went and find some more there are ada satu twenty dollars
ya ya so so kita ya so kita beli that one err without the pants you know just the baju
and then pakai baju and then okay kita nak makan sebab dia nak belanja dia nak belanja makan
so dia belanja makan and then dah belikan baju like it's a very good day so kita makan kat tekka kat bawah
it was so good macam sedap gila sebab ya
ah yang yang ada kaki escalator
escalator abeh ada escalator ah dekat-dekat situ abeh pastu kita cari tempat duduk nasib baik ada tempat duduk but err remember when kita played chope the card game ya we kita bilang each other macam ni kau punya tak dapat kat meja sebab kita main chope selalu kalah so err khalis maybe

tapi susah lah I don't have that ah woman attraction ah aku susah nak dapat attention daripada perempuan I don't know why but
tapi kita punya uh syarikat ni kan ada satu yang ada satu macam punya perangai ah
macam mana eh
tapi macam mana kau bilang aku eh kita kat sini berapa orang jer manpower habis tu
sampai sekarang takde takde ah lagi satu placement untuk orang
abeh macam mana sia kerja
ah the apa tu works that they have done for the ah and then ah ya correct correct
boleh ah I think I think can get ah
korean ada eh
jepun punya orang ah
you can try ah tapi kalau
yang cement part where they want to pour
yang belakang tu belakang glass

macam mana tu kau handle aku pun sorry for you ah but
nanti appraisal dia kasih pun it's up to
bagus eh
ini tak boleh lah
down here ah the way they do appraisal macam mana tau okay appraisal time I give you the appraisal form you you go and grade yourself
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
kereta I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of kasut
so like so pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main
pakai apa apa-apa kasut lah
actually pandai ah

then after that he try to subtlely cakap melayu with me then I find it so cute seh
cause like he trying to say that he tak ngam with his
then he was like cause actually I never ngam with my ex-supervisor then I was like LOL LOL LOL
termenung jauh nampak then it's so weird to hear him speak malay seh but at least he made the effort
he also penat he won't talk one ah we just like so glad that then he said eh tak happy ke nak off day
biasa ah tak ada kerja
tak apa if you nak I masak kan I think dapur tu terbakar terus
cause kan I have a friend uh nama dia amelia
I don't know what she was cooking ah tapi kan dia kasi bila dia kasi family dia makan kan semua kena food poisoning
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie entah
I think untuk raya ke pe but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya selain dari masak is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did
he spam zi qing asking me to like asking her to get me to accept him tu semua and then it was like I don't know how many days he did that but then zi qing menyampah so she she she like scolded me lah like eh can you tell ateeb to shut up or not ah you know he keep on texting me and spamming me non-stop huh asking me to like get you to get together with him then like oh my god I don't even like him then because of that
uh kitanya clique broke up ah
so so everytime he ask me out like it was to buy stuff for zi qing or like to plan a date with zi qing then I was like bro what am I you know you ask me out you bring my hopes up and then like all for her you might as well just wah fuck I got friendzone so hard so many times man and then ateeb tak give up so apparently kan did you know this apparently ateeb spread a rumour and like a lot of people believed that I was dating ateeb
okay never mind apparently he he spread it to his friends ah so like the guys tu semua
so so I was like huh since when then tala kata apa oh ateeb kata we've been dating since sec two ke sec one then I was like bro I have never liked him that way I never accepted to be his girlfriend I never said yes to him or anything
menyampah seh and then um after that we go off contact ah then in sec err year one poly he texted me uh
begging me for forgiveness then I was like okay you know what we're in poly now so I should be the bigger person and maafkan dia you know matang tu semua
so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen
kan wait don't tell him that that's why he's like he has a inferiority complex against his abang but anyways then I told him like oh um sorry ah but my friend um I just made up a white lie like oh my friend's already dating someone so she's not interested in you or like in dating anyone else and they will I felt like they will be together for a long time cause like they are they are very um into each other tu semua then I I thought he gave up tau

then it unblock him again ya so and then then he was apologising tu semua then I was like okay never mind you know last chance tu semua so I forgive him then he he was telling me about how err apa he he stuck in cause he was he intern at a ship
right so I felt bad for him ah cause like bulan puasa kan lepas tu bulan puasa dia lagi kat situ tau
so I felt bad so I was like okay lah takpe lah text jer pe bukannya apa then he started asking me eh do you know anyone uh who might be interested in dating me tu semua then I kata you duduk kat hotel pe tengok lah situ ada budak cute ke tak kan
and then lepas tu um he was like what about you you know um we we don't have to be anything exclusive can just be then I was like bro I don't even like the way you look I don't even like your personality I don't even accept your money
I'm not even desperate enough to start dating you what makes you think that I want to be with you huh you and yourtiny ass dickwhat are you going to do man I mean I kata ah you nak you desperate sangat you pergi geylang you cari perempuan sendiri

kan lagipun you sebagai orang islam you nak paksa-paksa ni kenapa hmm takde iman
nak nak nak main-main I tak kisah lah I pun main-main selalu pe tapi you nak you nak cakap you nak paksa I buat ni untuk apa and then I mengamuk so I I just block him on whatsapp then he started spamming me on text then started calling me non-stop
ya but I didn't I didn't open any of his messages like I just baca the notification then lepas tu I tutup yeah and then lepas tu he found me on telegram
telegram satu benda you know now where he's texting me

how could you and then like he was making it up to be like I cheated on him ke pe tau like we weren't even friends we weren't even doing anything I already told you that I wasn't interested in you and then you yang nak mati-mati nak dengan I you yang desperate sangat and then lepas tu I ignore you lah I tak buat salah pe
I dah bilang you I tak suka and then you tetap nak so I ignore lah and then dia mengamuk and then lepas tu dia kata I'll pay you just to reply me wah I was so tempted to say each reply will cost one hundred dollar
you nak you nak I jawab sangat kan ah bayar aku seratus dollar dulu but then I rasa macam mak I kalau dia nya family dia dapat tahu abeh dorang buat police report mampus aku
so I was like okay lah takpe<malay> lah nak duit pun takde lah aku aku desperate sangat
this this monday ke tuesday
err I think I saw him saying like D why you ignoring me please I really need you right now I really need a friend like you then I was like huh you fikir I bodoh sangat ke pe oh my god
then lepas tu we also started talking pun recently juga
ya so then diana main-main dia kata what if ateeb jumpa aku punya address
tak nak ah
so um he I think he bought her a lot of stuff juga lah and then lepas tu uh the one that crystal like was I think it was justin
oh my god dude you know that was my favourite time you know why cause kan um everytime justin tertidur kan then uh he will like depend on me to like take down notes for him tu semua then I tolong dia dengan homework then I betul-betul jaga dia tau so everytime I selalu bawa bekal gi sekolah pe then he would makan my bekal like we would share share tu semua tau
abeh dalam kelas kita selalu main-main sama-sama like
we would play with our phones under the table tu semua tau and then like he he started like suruh I main-main dengan rambut dia
sedih<malay> seh we wah we could have something on damn it but ya I don't know man sedih
hais okay lah um it's been one hour lah so kita end sekarang
 semua ke
 bagus ah  macam gitu
 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
mm aku rasa pukul enam eh

so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old
berapa episode berapa season
satu jer ada
okay bagus
ya it's so sad uh banyak
banyak but
shows nak kena
either like postpone their dorang punya release because of COVID
bila dia when is it supposed to be
ya same as apa tu yang mugen train also what it was released quite super damn early in apa tu
in japan lepas tu like only came in singapore berapa bulan jer nanti
ya macam
not transfer macam how they send over copies to
macam but what what cloud can carry that then how we have google drive
ya I'm I'm so interested in that macam I think that's what
to datang in like in a dalam ada bawa briefcase
wait so back then actually dah ada
err apa tu portrait on
ah nak kasi nanti lah sekejap lagi
ya twenty more minutes sayang
speedy nak say something
okay tunggu kejap jer just now I give you food you don't want to take
pastu macam gini ah how how how anyhow like that can ah
tak don't breathe on the thing
ya macam
apa tu err different types of
jap eh do you want anything from pasir ris
tak nak my brother can get Gong Cha you want
ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering
I dah apa lagi err vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
I kering I dah squeeze dry
I dah compress tu jer
ya I dah I've done quite a lot of things lah
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai

you sudah kenyang kan
what ice cream tak kenyang ah you sure you just ice cream I can buy
at first I thought like bedek lah ini macam global myth ah tapi macam then a lot of people was really cause there is no confirmation you you hear a lot of the story on the internet
bersunat ah
can semua boleh work from home
ah nampak lama sangat
cause turkey turkey has always prided itself on being a a circular state like they are they are muslim majority but they are also like very very proud they are very proud of their progressiveness like err women don't need to wear the the tudung and ya lah I mean it's good but
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that eh dia ini macam macam mahu but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up
macam brotherhood lah
oh he got to K so he he got tahan because he take itself lah you that's the border the demarcation then you of course he gonna get in trouble they cross the thing you got the
I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle
kalau sound uh
actually any sound tu I takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if ah I tak pergi where what is ah my favourite place to go I will pick uh
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers bunga basically like I said lah bunga cantik like I really really really
you know my favourite ah bunga matahari bunga matahari is my kesukaan bunga matahari tu lah macam every time I tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia
the colour dia colour macam cerah kan colour kuning kan dia macam what ah it it will lift up your mood
to to plant and to jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga rose tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena ah selalu
kasi dia air so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well lah from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
bunga matahari I nak tanam pokok bunga matahari ya
plants and looking at ah flowers bloom bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak eh
pokok eh bunga cantiknya
ah it will make us macam it will make

exactly exactly then I macam like
I tak I don't understand
he already dah buat like perangai he got buat perangai already last night
he like you want me to change so you want me to change now because he cakap

ah you really masak maggi ke masak apa
but sederhana lah you know

kalau phase three they allow us to you know
I feel like malaysia sekarang macam
dapat pergi malaysia fuh full on
pergi usually if I go there I pergi mana eh
johor bahru yang
ah pergi johor bahru ah dekat apa tu the mall nearby
ah city square mall also pun kat situ pun ya
murah-murah pe barang

kakak famous
I feel you I feel you okay ah there are also macam there are also perks to wearing masks ah like you don't have to tegur
all the time like you see people right you don't have to tegur what because you don't know they don't realise that it's you you know
ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah
panas sia
so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya lah it's always like that lah the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right

aku terus cakap dengan kau lah eh
tadi kalau kau pernah pergi kat one north kan kau akan terlihat seorang perempuan gempal tau kau pernah nampak tak
siapa eh mesti kau pernah nampak dia kirakan uh yang temperature screener dekat sebelah one north security kan
iya lah kat luar station tu lah so sekali hari aku dah pernah jumpa dia tapi dia ni pula kelakar ah cakap dari sini eh dia masih bersuami
ada anak dua tinggal dengan suami tapi dia ada matair lain kat luar matair dia pula dalam case kau faham jadi aku nak kenal-kenal dengan dia pun macam mana ni
suami lain matair lain abeh aku ni siapa ah cina buta jadi aku cakap ah tak payah lah aku korbankan sensasi bontot dia kan aku korbankan aku punya niat
aku tak nak teruskan tapi aku nak tegur dia dia takda aku rasa dia dah tak tahu entah resign ke apa tapi budaknya baik abeh aku rasa umur dia tiga puluh dua tahun
K kita punya segment macam segment segment apa segment rumah tangga pula eh kau ni jauh-jauh seh dari kau punya line
jadi sekali hari tu aku balik naik sampai ke choa chu kang lot one K hujan lebat aku ikut dia babe dari jauh sebab aku kirakan macam dah buang tebiat kan jadi
pada ketika tu aku nampak dia bawa barang banyak tau lepas tu dia belanja tu bulan puasa babe bulan puasa recently
dia nak balik dari dia punya lot one nak naik bus kan lepas tu aku nak ikut dia sekali aku aku tak dapat cari dia punya jejak lah dia hilang tanpa jejak
kemudian hilang jejak dia pun um the next day aku jumpa lagi aku ikut lagi ah this time aku beranikan diri aku approach dia tak silap aku that time oh okay
aku approach dia aku tanya nombor telefon dia ketika dia tengah temperature screening so aku rasa a few days later berapa hari yang lalu
the next day aku jumpa dia ah aku minta tanya dia lah nombor telefon dia lah eh
dia perasan aku bilang dia aku bilang apa yang terjadi lah aku bilang dia saya ikut awak gini gini beberapa hari yang lalu dia bodoh bodoh ingat aku ni macam psycho takde lah niat saya nak kawan-kawan jer takde apa-apa
so lepas tu aku tak kenal sangat pasal dia kita pun jumpa ah ajak keluar makan ah
keluar makan pastamania itu kira bila bulan puasa lah jadi aku tengok dia
so far okay ah tinggal dekat choa chu kang anak dua tapi dia kasih tahu aku status dia ah
so suami dia kirakan okay lah cakap cakap kira cakap pendek kirakan
bawa perempuan tu datang rumah kat atas katil dia kan dua dua terancang lah dia dapat tangkap she came back jadi
dia benar-benar rasa marah kan so aku tak tahu apa terjadi
tapi dia kata demi untuk anak-anak dia masih simpan perkahwinan dia tapi pada masa yang sama dia jumpa satu abang grab ni lah dia naik grab kan dia jumpa satu abang bawa grab ni kan abang tu pula pun kat dalam case nak ceraikan bini dia
jadi masing-masing mungkin dalam situasi yang sama jadi masing-masing pun kantoi mungkin uh masing-masing berpacaran ah for the past like seven eight months sebelum aku nak masuk dalam picture
tapi kalau aku kaji kembali aku lihat eh
aku rasa tak boleh kan sebab apa ni uh complicated kan betul tak
kalau aku nak jumpa dia sekali pun nanti aku pun rasa tak sedap eh kalau aku kalau aku ajak dia keluar ajak makan mungkin aku belikan dia barang ke apa ah kau rasa sesuai ke dia dia masih bekas bini orang
abeh lepas satu matair orang aku ni siapa cinta buta takkan tiga orang dengan satu takkan nak takkan nak gang bang pula tak boleh babe takkan tiga dengan satu boleh gang bang
tak boleh jadi aku rasa macam alamak tak kisah lah kasih dia lepas ah betul tak
aku dah stop jadi apa yang aku buat aku punya cara simple aku delete aku hilangkan padamkan nombor telefon beliau aku hilangkan aku ah buang segala
record record ataupun ah history eh
aku punya message message conversation dan juga eh so that's it so aku tak payah apa-apa ingat ingat lagi
so lepas tu dia pun tak message aku aku pun tak message dia jadi kita pun buat macam takde macam buat bodoh lah faham
aku dah lama tak contact dia jadi dah dekat dalam dua satu minggu lebih dua minggu jadi aku ingat dia masih kat sana tapi ni hari tak nampak

telefon aku sorry eh itu siti eh saya nama saya manap saya ni suami nya si
perempuan ni lah eh
eh kau kenapa kau tak ada perempuan lain nak cari eh this thing akan terjadi tau kita tak tahu apa yes walaupun lelaki dia main tiga sekali pun tidak bermakna yang aku boleh kacau bini dia

ah betul tak itu aku punya cerita
iya lah sebab ni pun datang asal nafsu buat apa kalau kau nak jumpa seseorang tu apa sebabnya kau nak kenal perempuan tu agama dia ke kecantikan beliau ke
kerja beliau ke harta ke kau tahu aku pula dalam case nanti aku cakap dengan bini aku very simple aku berdoa kepada allah subhannallah wa taala kalau benar benar
bini orang isteri aku yang cina ni sanggup berubah untuk aku dia sanggup convert agama huh aku bersama dia lapan tahun berumahtangga tak ada anak dia bayar segala-gala untuk aku aku terus cakap dengan kau untuk pengetahuan kau lah kasih kau

duit rumah dia bayar duit tong sampah dia bayar even macam dulu aku bawa kereta kan sometimes lah bulanan punya deposit pun dia bayar tau kereta tau
dulu aku bawa kereta kan mitsubishi dengan aku bawa C class kan jadi dia banyak membantu aku dari segi kewangan dulu aku pernah ada loan dulu aku pernah
ah apa ni ambil loan sampai sini tau dulu-dulu lah dia bayarkan aku punya hutang dia banyak berkorban wang ringgit untuk aku
tapi aku terbuat silap aku terkenal-kenal aku aku terkenal kenalan dengan satu seorang aku aku bilang kau kan
yang perempuan tu yang celaka tu kan jadi aku bilang diri aku kenapa allah bagi aku ujian besar jadi aku bilang dia okay lah untuk aku menghilangkan segala-gala aku punya keperitan aku malam aku kerja aku lupakan si pinoy tu
aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan
ini benar-benar berlaku lah aku rasa sukar tapi pada masa sama walupun sukar aku dah buat keputusan kalau katakan lah aku ditakdirkan bercerai kali kedua okay aku akan bergelar duda
tua duda tua eh aku akan bergelarkan duda tua lah tak kisah lah tua ke pun tak kisah jadi aku bilang diri aku kalau aku dah duda tua tak ada duit lagi teruk jadi aku nak jadi duda tua tetapi ada duit kau faham
aku nak jadi orang berduit kirakan aku nak kena kerja kuat aku nak kena banyak berjimat cermat aku nak kena banyak cari kerja dapat kerja dapat allow tarik tau dapat kerja malam pun ambil dapat rezeki ambil simpan betul tak jadi kalau duit ni dah ada nak buat apa okay aku ada hutang kakak aku bayar sikit hutang kakak aku kasih sedekahkan mak bapak aku faham aku bagi apa kau faham keluarga aku dulu aku nak focuskan keluarga aku dulu

dia sekarang status dia okay lah aku
kata dia dia bilang aku yang dia sudah denounce dia bilang aku dia dah denounce bulan may last year
jadi kira dah setahun lebih lah dia dah denounce tapi aku tahu mungkin dia buat itu kerana perasaan marah jadi
yang allah subhanallah wa taala dan tuhan kita dan nabi muhammad salallah wasalam kita punya ah rasulullah kita punya ini
aku rasa tak jadi masalah aku rasa masih boleh bawa dia ke dalam akram kan tapi pendapat ustaz sana kan dia boleh
ah peluk balik lah agama islam kan tapi mungkin nak kena bagi course lah kan

kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal
nanti walau dia boleh bayar kau dia boleh sponsor kau dia boleh
ah support kau mungkin kau tak cukup duit sebab aku tengok kau kadang-kadang sesak macam aku juga kan
nanti dia kata eh azri you okay tak you you nampak macam apa ni takda ah I punya motor
dia punya ah spark plug meletup ah gini oh berapa tiga ratus ah nanti I transfer you
dia orang akan kalau perempuan tu kan kau dia akan buat ni semua babe dia akan beli kau dengan duit dia orang tapi bila kau dah termakan budi mereka
apa yang berlaku kau akan rasa bersalah sebab aku ada anak bini jadi kau mesti ingat tau kalau kau nak pinjam duit kalau perempuan nak tolong kau kau mesti hati-hati
nanti perempuan tu nak kau punya masa nak kau punya time commitment kau faham

nak himpit kau kau berhati-hati tau kau jangan tergoda dengan bisikan syaitan
siala sini muka muka muka izzati abeh muka si kak zarina abeh muka sumati muka si kak sabariah
bukan ah kau tak akan kau tak boleh pandang remeh ni perkara kalau satu hari kau berjumpa dengan si girls macam gini kau ingat pesanan aku
jadi kau kau kau senyum dan kau cakap satu jer lah kau cakap
jangan marah ah itar saya ni
ah ada plan tengah hari mungkin nak jumpa I punya wife nak makan sama-sama kau bohongkan gitu sudah
itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi
I gave proposal tapi yang dapat kerja orang lain aku tak nak ini punya cerita
kita dah berbual selama empat puluh dua minit alhamdulillah jadi tak mengapa

ini tak kena mengena dengan kita tapi aku cakap nevermind kau just tengok kita punya issue you see our air issue
ah kita part kita dah maintain lah jadi tempat kau orang nak kena buat sesuatu so
we just let him know that what have been done and what required by the tenant ah faham
ah aware aware aware ya he will tell victoria meter punya cerita very simple as per fiona's permalas fiona said
this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin
apa yang dia nak gini tapi so far aku rasa based on my understanding is like
ah cakap dengan fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
that is a requirement tapi kan he said masa tu cakap tak payah there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause ah
tak boleh dia mesti ada submission you must do a proper submission
yes I know dia bilang apa tau dia punya orang gas will do a submission
kau nampak message dia kan
that's why aku bilang kau okay lah I I give myself this one two days lah a latest by friday cause friday

okay lah back to covalent so tomorrow covalent akan datang we will show him
contractor for the aircon based on covalent punya ah ah apa ni specs
and then aku akan tengok apa dia punya sambutan boleh then kalau lye boleh bikin aku boleh minta lye quote juga
ah tapi bilang lye lah kalau engkau nak quote be careful lah kalau lye quote terlalu murah

okay ah biasa jer how about you
oh banyaknya
so um we actually met at bugis so then we went to walk around at bugis junction first because we want cause uh we want cause we met late afternoon so we decided to not we decided he ajak me go solat at masjid sultan
so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to masjid sultan then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really um masuk early kan so we had to waste our time first before we go to masjid then
then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
yes ya and also macam
when I think bila fikir balik kan
um datang balik pun
if really then I'll give in ah but if not then malas ah
philosopher tak menjadi
yang online friend tu kan
wait wait wait where is he from dia dari mana
is neil the one that it's like the best friend of the one that you ask me tu
so jadi
sekarang kau tak berbual dengan dia ah
I kau ingat sampah
ya that's the first one which was like in april bila aku masih berbual dengan lelaki lagi satu tu
dia masih chat aku lagi
how dah tak boleh balik kan cause
dia masih sekolah kat china kan
any feelings for him again right it's just like macam why why do you want to talk to me like I thought you went back to your ex that she don't like
aku fikir dia fikir macam kita kawan jer kot
why is it taking way longer than when I date with sampah sampah was like
yang lelaki yang kau message kat imessage tu tak berbual lagi
kau babitkan aku though
I want to get back to the online punya
bro I just aku cuma nak kawan I don't want sex
got there was once I met a nice guy and he okay and he's muslim then abeh dia cakap why are you here then I was like why can't I be here like he was trying to be like you know macam mak bapak gitu like why are you here
administrator punya
then I had to angkat the boxes up to the sink
like macam aku fikir
in dalam kepala aku kan aku macam
aku tak akan baik cause
but eh sampai mak aku risau seh mak aku was like
jangan lah nangis
like I asked my mother urut also
tak hilang so I was just like
I don't know how to explain it it's just macam
aku dah cakap jangan pegang kau pergi pegang then I was like
the previous day punya bread
macam boxes of it
sedap cause
kiosk is the macam mcdonald's tu
mcdonald's yang kau order kat depan tu abeh dia picit picit yang itu ah
in front of the masjid
depan um
then you take to kembangan station then you have to walk to masjid then cross
but the restaurant okay the restaurant is okay but makanan dia sedap
paling pendek is
so nak kerja susah sikit
okay tapi kalau kerja sana kan
kurang ajar sia
I mop everything sapu
sapu the outside and inside the office also
what the heck and they went home already and then the kitchen was dark then I was like takkan nak biarkan ni kat sini nanti
and wash it and then the tempat
cuci pinggan is at the back near the back door then the back door
naik motor woo
then now pakai mask kan
I'm not blaming aku tak blame lecturer ah but
punya course kan
kau punya lesson plans macam mana
I would aku betul-betul tak berbual dengan orang dari kita punya sekolah
dia dia boys
I don't know eh dia
but I don't know aku tak tahu kenapa dia orang stop
dia macam what
get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah

orang kan adik adik tunjuk ibu kan gambar yang tadi kat corner itu ibu nampak
corner sini pun ibu boleh nampak I see a light like
different colour like ada macam

who say dia gelap
no I said because inside dia punya
facebook dia ada taruh inside nasi dia kat dalam
so that dulang is I know is for four to six pax punya makan lah
so far tak ada yang untuk two pax
so actually I already ordered semua individual before that I already order all because I tengok tak ada
for dulang for two pax is always uh four and above
err macam not so nice like nak kasih uncle one packs two pack like macam
tak lah uncle dombang like kasih like one packet two packet like macam you know

in a dulang
you look like macam apa pre pack your food macam ini you taruh dulang like cantik ah nampak ayam nampak semua ah
instead of that ah so that cakap possible not to do this dia cakap yes possible
so ibu cakap okay lah since dia cakap possible so I make a table lah put there
tray lah dulang in a in a dulang lah I cakap
dia cakap ya possible
so after that I send him the table to show that dia jangan salah lah
then okay they can put now dia pergi buat satu dulang

I cakap hidup
if I known I cakap I won't ask you is it possible I ask you is it possible then you said ya ya can
itu that time kelmarin yang
we order takoyaki uh that day satu then after that we order yang nasi yang masa mika datang itu ibu order the tray satu
ayah satu buang lah but we actually ibu nak buang sekali ayah pergi cuci so ibu okay ayah sudah cuci put aside lah so ibu pakai that tray lah
so the rest pasal ibu ada tupperware besar sikit then okay lah put there lah ya
ibu purposely bikin table tau
uh ya lah like macam I I put there berapa eh
okay I put there bento mandi chicken

then three bento uh bento mandi chicken with add on kofta kebab
okay that one also correct ada tiga mandi chicken with
then I book one set mandi chicken uh buffet for five pax itu yang
dia bikin yang ibu cakap untuk kita kan dia cakap for five pax itu pun okay I he understood one set
then in the end dia kasih kat ibu
ya lah after that ibu call dia lah pasal bila sampai dia kasih ibu like packet dia ibu cakap macam tak nampak that round tray ada empat it's it's only satu but then I don't want to make a fuss I I ah cakap eh this one is only satu jer habis dia cakap ya lah ya lah I'm like just carry jer
just carry bring back itu lah then bila sampai rumah nenek ayah nak pack pack lah kat situ habis kat sana macam panas kan then ibu cakap no lah hantar rumah nenek satu then after that
kita pack pack
uh habis pergi rumah nenek then baru ibu buka ibu buka
satu jer that big round tray with itu habis
then I call her lah I say cakap you know when I say you put in my table I stated there four set what so by right must have four set lah why it's only one if not I just put one set right
otherwise ibu pun tanya dia it's possible because in your photo it's already show what is only five and above punya tak ada one pax for apa one round tray for two pax
entah lah jiu yang hari itu kasih habis after that
dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap

habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming
jadi takut dia tak tahu jadi ibu cakap uh I'm sending apa
to you lah habis dia kata no need lah no need save money lah now COVID lah save money I cakap I pay already lah cakap dia cakap don't waste money like that I pay already lah oh you pay already uh uh okay
so I promise ibu sudah cakap aunty bait dengan aunty lisha saja so the rest ibu tak cakap then just imagine kalau semalam ibu sudah balik ibu balik dua belas setengah dua belas setengah balik sini uh pack pack pack sudah pukul berapa orang pun hungry nasib baik ibu tak bilang yang lain ada orang tunggu tunggu kata nak hantar lauk kat mana uh
tapi dia orang hungry macam mana
the one who make noise is ayah bukan ibu lah
of course ibu uh huh angry juga lah but then ibu tak
you know ayah kan the way ayah cakap kan that's why ibu cakap no
sometime we plan but allah yang tentukan yang whether
of course we will nak macam gini tapi we plan but then if asal allah tak izinkan allah cakap no it cannot be planned as what you want I will change the plan so uh if you can like this lah
ah dia bila dia gitu dia diam lah nanti jap ya lah tapi
uh tapi bila ibu cakap allah itu dia diam lah

anime ada banyak type like what's your genre in anime
aku pun agree
selain anime
tak tahu ah this one is your favourite or not but it is two days one night
oh he's I don't know when is the last time I watched two days one night tak tahu ah bila

kalau aku ingat it is
agaknya that time
kalau uh I

I also think macam itu juga ah
kalau for me
um selain McDonald's what's your favourite fast food also
yes ya dia dari uh datang dari filipino
I boleh makan like three piece or five piece of chicken
it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news
kalau free ke apa tengok lesung
sekarang ni I watch bara
aku rasa uh
dah ada dekat uh mobile
uh habis senang untuk kita just you know
you pay one-time fee habis senang untuk
can watch your favourite anime tapi depends ah
sometimes not all the show that you want ada dekat dalam
apa cerita you tengok dekat
yes so kadang-kadang my class start at eight
the latest that I arrive paling lambat I think pukul lapan
tapi I will try my best to come school early next time
cuba juga improve my
now I have a lot of projects so tengah nak habiskan semua
lama seh
I think nak apply kerja
susah lah nak cari duit
err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places
macam we get to see the apa itu
scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that

itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you

makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak

but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again

there's one video that shows that uh satu okay there's two video ah after dengan before ah there's this two cat before video
ada dua kucing then
so yang cat itu the other cat is he keeps looking for dia punya partner
macam you can see that body language dia he's like macam he feels sad ah
dia macam roaming around the house looking for the person

then bila I salam ya I salam nenek abeh I cium dia but obviously nenek is a bit uncomfortable with it then she like elak-elak
you know when you salam her also she's like that what ya
ya she will just immediately retract it back which is damn weird so I macam mm okay lah whatever then I told nenek
oops tersalah nak cium mama alah cium jer lah nenek sekali
no but like the doctor issue is still fine the muntah issue is still fine but the fact that it's so bad that you have to be sent home from work like like
I don't know lah but it's a bit it's not like ngada-ngada ah I feel like I'm a bit like
I don't know maybe maybe ngada-ngada is the word ah I don't know maybe just annoying
ya because I was busy at home if I'm at mama's house I'm usually like talking to nenek and mama
I cannot believe we have to gossip for a good end ah one hour but it's okay these are all juicy details so at least people will actually be entertained when they dengar and dia macam wah actually this couple quite interesting we have to vet this we have dude come on this is not a chore

dia cycle daripada pasir ris no ah apa bicycle

kepala otak you I don't think that's possible

I ada lagi berapa bulan ah for recontract
I know but yours is twenty four months contract but then you took twenty one month so that's three months short if you keep doing that every two years obviously you're short like three it means twenty four months contract dia dah habis

ah dia something like that ah ya so that's why dia mesti like collect ramai orang gila punya that one
punya punya conversation
I think a lot people are willing to speak for one hour actually it will be very smart of them to just tap on a conversation because it's very hard to talk bila you kena paksa macam sekarang ah tadi kita nak start kan punya lah susah
I think the other parts I'm not so worried for because ya that's true exactly tu yang I takut
macam lah I tak tahu you punya password eh esok nak masak apa ah

we are the hardworking we are the hardworking student who actually give an hour no I'm very sure it's an hour lah I don't know why you keep saying six minutes six minutes is the content of mother tongue faham tak
no actually we we did a very good job in mixing both melayu and english together
pasal generally kita dua do not just strictly speak english kita dua actually speak both I think so as in like from based on my own observation

and then ya mama loves to watch al-hijrah punya news because the news all like macam
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the err adik ipar pakai motor dia motor dia hilang
so rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi which is true lah dia curi lah as in without the permission lepas tu accident
ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star
empat league jer tau
tak tahu ah kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa ah malam aku tak kesah
aku balik jer terus aku boleh jumpa kau ah
abeh kau fikir aku familiar ah kirakan aku pun baru ambil download jer semalam
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay aku tak I never touch the app
aku tu dah jumpa kau pe
correct aku download aku jumpa kau after aku kita berbual semua and everything aku balik dah pukul satu pagi
aku buka tu computer aku tukar cup sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi
there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh
ah tu kau nak
eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap
tak ah
dalam empat tahun jer lah
aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main ah I mean
sekarang dengan situation gini camne aku nak main bola sia
so what this guy did was dia tak slide ah
I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah
time kau tau
time kau
time kau CISCO aku tak datang rumah kau tau
ada sekali kau datang eh no there was one before after kau CISCO juga aku baru masuk so time kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak
balik rumah kau nak change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so aku teman kau aku datang rumah
then aku lepak-lepak kat living room kau
second time was cause kita nak keluar makan dengan parents aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa that was the only two times ah
to sit down and properly lepak dalam rumah kau ni the last time I did that kita masih secondary school
most of time aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah pe
masih ah kau
tak tahu lah
kau tahu kan the situation sekarang kan you've been unemployed longer than I have
teruk siol
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere kau tahu kan
so kapal terbang dia keluar
pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik ah tak gi mana-mana
no just to maintain airtime and to apa tu free up ah parking space
cause kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang for very long
it can run down macam let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes ah
which is why most of their ah apa tu employees all retrenched
kau masuk if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
kau tak leh compare
mahal that's why they
so the apa tu the postal macam okay ah aku nak buat deed good deed so ah aku nak send out
free masks to every household just for free ah aku send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no aku tak approve ni tak boleh masks tak work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside macam fish nets
kau tahu fishing net kan ada lubang lubang tu kan so mask dia berlubang
and then kau pakai so case kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung ah tapi kau masih pakai mask
ah ye mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work ah kirakan
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
okay today good day for you semua okay
location penting but
provided let's say there's no more COVID there's no kan macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
hey okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat novena which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places
to go to let's say you are very hip and you like there's a place for you too and let's say you are you are someone yang macam suka
macam gini ah
I am stating the facts of the funan mall and I am I like that mall I mean you dah pernah pergi dia punya rooftop right and the views from there thanks to me who brought you what do you say about that
aiya ya my one of my friend pun tried to go up there dengan kawan dia juga then macam eh okay
but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma I think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
but wah kalau
your drone kena shoot down seh kalau you fly
mm betul juga
I just read this article um one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu ah so they are offering
ya tak ingat
do you think mothership articles are like legit and kita boleh percaya
hmm macam
what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind tapi they are more seniors I tak pasti
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
okay I'll make a guess mungkin SGAG
well as compared to my point of view macam I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
wow so old fashion macam zaman-zaman dulu bapa bapa
tapi checkers macam
wait dam
oh dam lah okay okay
cause sampai sekarang kan I don't know the difference between dam dengan chess wait chess is the one dengan the horses things right

um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch

and then you need to macam every rental car they provide you with a shovelish kind of thing
I hope one day I mean all these will go away lah inshallah you know just dua for the best
that much anymore macam I get so annoyed cause of him

after a few days pun it's the same it's the same thing
kau pun dah nothing much to do abeh ah like err after a few
weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah
ah ni kasut dia ni ni kasut dia tu
eh hari ni datang ada kasut baru ah ni ada budak attachment baru ke okay ah ada member ah siol aku ingatkan
local poly ke apa ah local student aku dah excited ah at least ada member eh pasal kau hari-hari kerja pun muka muka sama mendak ah
sekali aku buka pintu masuk office buda china ah siol
dia dia err and he he's he's not from a local polytechnic lah he
bukan bukan he's he's a he's he's from china tapi dia punya course is from
err err err apa ni err building construction authority kirakan macam mana nak cakap eh
ah macam
okay ah it's to put it simply macam
ah aku
aku masuk fire fire fighting apa eh
dia orang ada separate course apa fire fighting course eh macam
tapi untuk building building punya sector ah kirakan aku masuk ni course
aku dari poly tapi untuk some students hantar
ah so so okay ah dia so bila aku nampak dia alamak budak china pula eh aku ingatkan pasal kau tahu
at that aku tak tahu lah sekarang still I think now still the same tapi back then
they couldn't speak english well lah and then they they just speak mandarin to you aku pun dah ibarat macam
err apa macam ayam dengan itik ah berbual
so okay lah  aku ingatkan ah okay lah at least ni ada attachment ada budak attachment okay lah
ah err just talk ah pasal
apa everyday pun got nothing much apa so just try to strike up a conversation
err strike a conversation pun like he doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say pun aku pun tak berapa faham
aku pun tahu like he doesn't really get me so okay lah just just
just err or just hi bye gitu ah
but the funny thing was apa ni
dia lagi apa eh err
dia lagi lagi laid back dari aku ah siol
a'ah ah dia lagi lepak dari aku lah siol
dia like literally
bukan nak kata aku like the model student ah aku pun aku pun ada juga ah memang ah aku lepak ah tapi aku pun err you have to be smart ah kau tak boleh
err macam selalu err apa err
tunjuk orang kau you have to balance it out ah
macam aku bukan aku hari-hari pula err datang datang office lambat
ah so aku aku hari ever since office boy dah dah macam cover aku eh office boy dah dah macam
ah dia dah tolong tolong aku aku tiap-tiap hari datang office lambat
pasal aku tahu aku dah tahu dia punya timing bila aku datang office tak ada orang dalam office so selalu aku datang bila tak ada orang dalam office
ah ah tapi when
when it comes to bila kau nak tunjuk muka ah then kau
tunjuk muka ah
ah so you you just have to be smart about it ah tapi yang this this other guy like he literally like
err dia punya suka ah
dia ah
dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so kan aku bilang kau apa ni err
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that err they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje ah dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku err tak
tak kenal aku pe macam dia ni siapa siol abeh tanya oh who are you aku cakap attachment student oh attachment student abeh dia tanya aku err singaporean ah ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya siol
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where where want to work in construction one work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down siol serious aku dengar terus down
tapi ah ah tapi ya lah apa that was
I was still young ah you you you didn't really understand it lah tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry eh
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like
tak dapat pergi like a lot of things came into my mind ah
apa like
at that time was like really down ah really down abeh ah
aku didn't work for four months
ya ah apa
ah kau cakap pasal tu pun err apa
was at its peak ah aku punya office dalam office aku tu that same floor one of the one of the office lady
okay lah quite close so at that time pun like eh siala macam
err apa a lot of err uncertainty a lot of
err suspense ah like eh macam mana ni eh apa aku pun risau aku pun takut jangan aku positive sudah abeh nanti aku tak dapat pergi like you have
ah nasib baik ya lah eventually the lady she recovered from COVID and none of the office staff on my floor were tested positive also lah as in we we didn't we we didn't have to at that time belum ada swab test ah

younger person also they would be more like oh a younger person maybe I can hentam ah ketuk this ketuk this
beratur like satu jam dua jam ah but this one
for their own ubat ah they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference ah
you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like
sorry McDonald's kenapa kau selalu bagi mcgriddles macam sikit sikit jer
ya macam betul seriously sia
but uh everytime after makan breakfast I will tend to have diarrhoea sakit perut
the mcgriddles punya I think the heavy one is the egg one
ya ada
boleh boleh ah boleh ah boleh ah tak lah kat secondary secondary
actually I can recall almost banyak ah
I don't know ah chill eh kejap let me think let me think
okay lepas tu
my I join err apa ni floorball
ya macam C division itu semua B division
other orang yang macam dah tahu main floorball
to macam beli stick itu semua ah so I made my own stick
ya I did ah I used macam sapu kau tahu penyapu dia punya yang wood tu ya
but I use a normal you know kiddy ball macam eh kiddy ball
macam budak budak yang kids suka main tu yang bouncy ball
ah I use that as a floorball ball lah then the thing I use use use I play aku practise lah
aku practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua
because they never ajak us ke apa they just let us one side
okay okay tu bagus ah actually
floorball macam collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members ah so
then macam okay ah apa set ah then I then I go interview then I like
confirm malam I stay at bedok like jauh kan I was like
that's how I that ah then lah itu lah that's how I ended up in
tapi tak ya I think it's becoming popular because I think we're good at floorball
because I go to I go watch macam tengok tournament itu semua kan some of my friends are in the national team
I don't know like you minah like that eh I don't know why ah I damn scared of you sia
I know okay one thing for sure kau punya idea bagus gila like no joke and some
but that ni but I feel like cause kita tak banyak orang ah tak ah dah tak tak banyak manpower pun ni
points that kind of thing right cause got the apa apa
oh ya okay I feel like itu macam saja macam myth saja it's just to like oh just make you exercise
got music one ah ada music
kau kau join chinese dance is specifically chinese dance saja
bukan ada mix tak
vibing habis sekarang kau tak menari kau tak nak menari kau tak
so sekarang kau macam dance yang K-pop ke apa with your friend ah
eh we should kita mesti dance seh next time
ya but then because I don't know I I'm not good at following macam movement tahu
but kalau free style it's it's no boundaries up to me
but if you had a chance to like like you know like now people do the urban dance get kind of thing maybe like that kind macam gempak pun apa
oh the slow kind ah yang ni macam yang macam you know the ones that the choreography is like
ah kalau hip hop ke gitu okay ah you like you like you
it's that one takes time to appreciate it tak apa tak apa
rugged ah type macam rugged ah
oh tak kisah sangat ah
a bit err just macam sikit ah
then sekarang kau kau nak plan plan pergi university tak
macam mana nak cakap gigs gitu
I need to macam start from the bottom media and not
ya ya ya that's true that's true kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam
kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then kau belajar belajar sekali
but like but that's the thing though I think macam singapore kan dia orang they have like this emphasis on macam
kau mesti bagus at everything but like let's say
architecture okay then you major but nanti they say oh no you have to have good record
now that I think of it last time kan we always macam
oh aku nak jadi orang kaya then when you rethink about it now macam maybe I don't want to be a rich person
under under under under under us lagi you know like this so it's like
ah mata merah
apa bersefahaman eh why is does that sound like a paper kind of
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like
chose some baju that I want to give away and I'm giving away to rina cause she
she tanya lah ya and then but from eleven eleven ah what
I bought two jeans one white one black then I also beli ah two blouse ya one white and then is another blouse and then I also bought skincare which is apa tu ya
ya ya correct and the kasut lah
the hitam one the kasut is actually very nice
I actually nak pergi typo cause I want to buy some stuff from typo
ya tapi macam jauh ah cause I baru eh I pindah right
I pindah like from last two years I used to live nearer to like JEM but now I live like nearer to jurong point
ya if you naik the lah
you mean lampu raya
I want to apa tu volunteer
but like you know I tadi I went to the volunteer dot website and like most of the places like the volunteer places are like at the east eh
eh I I tak faham why I always so penat
like I sleep for apa like dua belas jam also I still can be so penat
wait you bangun pukul berapa
so actually I bangun pukul I bangun pukul lapan and then I
uh I tried to do stuff until pukul dua belas then pukul dua belas I went out mm I went out to ikea
macam chemical
entah it's like cause it's soya right
oh oh it used to it used to be apa tu from macam animals ah like dairy products but then now they change it to vegan
then macam tak sedap lah
ya actually macam takde apa-apa nak buat kat situ
tapi tadi I went there right and there was only like families
macam takde takde orang pergi dating ke takde budak-budak
mmhmm kan eh we also going skating right I a bit takut cause I tak tahu macam mana nak skate and then
okay dulu lah when I was like kecil like very young long time ago I I use the skates like the the that skates lah the fat one the wheels are very fat right
ya and then I jatuh you know and then I didn't skate anymore
no no no it's the roller blade the apa tu the roda is tajam right but then the skate the skating the indoor skating that we're going is the roda is like roundish and fat
so I a bit takut to go skating
I just tarik all of you down
I I think the the apa tu yang the round wheels right is harder to balance
ya cause like example ah you diri and then if you diri too straight then you can jatuh eh
ya you can jatuh backwards or if you sandar right you can jatuh also that's how I jatuh last time
oh my god I don't even kemas my bilik
I want to beli you know the like the mirror that is like panjang
but I also want to install you know kipas on the wall cause my kipas now is kat lantai
like cause I need to tarik my kipas everywhere cause
I'm panas then sometimes tertrip on the wire over the wire ya and my kipas also tak kuat sangat
cause now our window grille kan like we need to pasang the the mesh if not like our kucing can escape
ya so we want buy the grille that is like tak besar sangat so the kucing can like no need cannot escape lah
and we no need to pasang the mesh cause now like we all the windows got the mesh
ya no no no it's only the top and then the mesh like tangkap all the bulu
ya so we malas to bersihkan so we just change the window
eh when we keluar on the nineteen we should go to fatburgers
fatburgers ya is a apa tu sign
I think huda want to makan fatburger
no but apparently it's sedap
kat ang mo kio ada I think
oh ya kan kan tapi COVID so tak banyak ah
ya ya that time also I go then like a bit kosong and it was ya I think it was a weekend also cause usually banyak orang sampai tak boleh jalan or something ya but it was kosong ah
apa eh jap
you have one child but you have another one percuma oh
huh that's that's a bit gila
actually twins twins a bit fun when you grow up how many anak you want to have
your apa tu parents very cute
I mean they still muda
my my ibu and ayah they kahwin when they were twenty eight
ya and it's actually my my ibu still schooling cause she
she join like madrasah lambat lah and then she want to like continue islamic studies
so like like she like she never even kerja after she kahwin eh after she kahwin pula she never kerja after she like belajar
so after she belajar which is like she finish twenty eight then my ayah already macam apa simpan duit for how many years already so he sponsor everything
he sponsor the majlis the honeymoon all and then they kahwin at twenty eight but then they ambil like four years to get like my abang
so like they got my abang at thirty two
and you know they tunang for how long
they tunang for six years
dekat huh ya usually orang tunang apa dua tahun
eh I want to kahwin someone baik someone baik someone kacak someone
kalau boleh lah tapi tak boleh kan takpe
can ask nabilah nabilah got buat tu before
you want to berhenti here
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
boleh eh
ya I'm going under the apa yang yang suria viewership punya
ya ah apa tu si amirah pun join juga
apa tu um
I asked apa tu budak-budak sastera whether anybody keen
masuk benda ni ke tak so

I think I assume cause dia specifically
suruh aku tengok yang ah apa tu suria di akhir garisan punya
drama tau eh not drama like one of punya show for hari raya haji
ah like one hour plus punya show before attending this suria punya focus group ah
ya correct correct it was it was aired on suria it was aired on suria on hari raya haji
ah mungkin dia nak tanya kenapa ah did you why didn't you watch on suria ke apa did you even saw the trailer ke apa I think lah I assume ah
correct but it's it's a it's dia macam the storyline is very simple ah macam you know you nak pergi haji ada there's hiccups here and there abeh last last orang tu tak pergi haji pun
tau kesian juga ah actually
simple storyline tapi
dia punya cuma dia punya actor and actresses dia is not appealing macam tak appealing at all tau
um who is it ah yes syarif syarif tu syarif
tapi I wouldn't I wouldn't like just watch suria just to watch that faham
okay what what are what are your views ah kenapa kenapa why do you not watch suria
aku pun tak tahu actually

like your whole kampung can stay there
like you can just say hi mak
dekat sebelah like your mother house like literally dekat sebelah but you get your own house
nak ada apa durian rambutan
it's like so besar aiyoyo boleh jadi gila besar dia
is like must be besar lah kalau if it's like macam
kecil I mean like all singapore houses is like so small so kecil
a rumah sebesar
ah betul juga eh ya how come I never thought of that no but then like susah seh kalau macam
staycation tapi staycation masih like around singapore pe
besar ah rumah dia
so it's not made up of kayu you know like last time like they always made up of kayu
you like kayu or you like concrete
you got stay in kayu house before
never ee kentalnya
you know what they call that rumah panggung
that's why like malaysia I don't know eh malaysia like jarang seh
splinter nanti ada splinter then like mak tolong mak ada splinter
mak kau marah sia
north is like uh tempat macam sembawang ah yishun all the atas atas
what is happening there tak ada benda actually okay if you put right uh
okay you think about dia punya benda-benda yang ada dekat sana
nak migrate pergi mana
or to danga bay ya they've got pool you can just go out of the fray a bit I thought they are both right ni
jauh for what
north pun jauh seh
I think the red line super panjang seh dia punya dia punya line macam never ending
you daripada marsiling pergi
after the next stop after marsiling dia macam rasa macam forever dia just tak sampai-sampai macam
nama dia dekat like if you see the listing kan nama dia
tak tahu ha I don't know I don't what is it
oh ya balestier untuk orang kaya tau
untung lah ya man
landed mahal seh landed
wah so expensive seh I really tak sanggup like
kalau nak beli like the four room lah
ya like I would macam spend the
tak tak muai seh
wah like inflation ini semua inflation
empat ratus something empat ratus million juta no I don't think it's billion billion
banyak kan
boleh rent out
I think can make my own kilang
kecoh sia ya
macam oh aku ada kawan kat sana tak ya
tak ya book apa airbnb ke
and then some more you stay at the like two three storey house seram seh
because the currency also lain jadi macam
cost of living kalau if we kalau kita kerja kat sana
err you can also cause kita like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to then she say so aku kata like you beli rumah dekat woodlands
err you all err rasa macam you all save enough money to beli rumah dekat err
then you all just beli rumah dekat abeh rent out the rumah dekat err singapore ah dekat woodlands
abeh nanti orang cakap like imagine satu rumah like seven hundred dollars
satu rumah eh seven hundred dollars
satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the rumah that I want to go for is empat bilik
no dekat singapore ah so seven hundred uh times four
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even kerja
so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau
ah sabar two five
wow banyak pe
dia boleh pergi mana overseas dia pergi mana
sabar labrador park
okay apa apa lah tak tau
dah kata degree
oh shit mahal seh
tunda lah beli rumah tak akan beli
aduh peningnya kepala
tiga puluh ah tiga puluh
tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah seh
oh ya ya ya betul betul betul betul
eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham
dia tu lah
tak ada hospitalisation leave eh
lagi banyak kerja lah
ah kalau let's say the future
like lagi teruk macam mana
betul betul betul betul rabak ah macam betul betul macam for a moment kan
macam mana okay okay okay
how can the anak tak put aside
dia tak buat financial tu eh

kat singapore boleh lah tapi kalau dekat macam indonesia tak perlu seh then you want to do like at indonesia

combine ke tak combine
cause like you know like mum thing you like if you want you wouldn't want to friend to like you know like macam to share the habitats defence
sometimes they have like parents like ada dia punya own wish
okay lah tak larang kalau dia nak buat buat lah kalau ada duit tak ada duit nevermind
nasib baik got save save kalau tak save then like teruk sia macam gitu
sabar after like a certain period of time ke apa
ah ya lah macam insurance ah no it's not insurance it's investment
ya so kalau investment dia macam
okay so at the after twenty five years I keluarkan the duit
I keluarkan the duit like after twenty five years ah so
ya times the months and then after that dah tu dia punya interest ah
ah macam gitu
but ni semua masing-masing ah ya masing-masing like
sepuluh tahun up to you ah like what you want lor

err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
macam eh alhamdulillah weh eh um
menarik ah aku tengok kat a lot of people talking about this err politicians err president candidates ah
so basically nampaknya trump is no longer the president of america
so I've seen a lot of uh you know people talking about it a lot of people um cheering banyak lah banyak banyak gila lah yang
orang err apa tu support this joe biden instead of err trump eh
takde takde takde sound no song no
a'ah lah yes yes yes that was the if you did if you didn't tell me in the first place aku pun tak you ada ada jual and dekat dia punya Facebook eh
lepas tu pergi dekat dia punya shop now tu wah
I was so shocked by the apa by the things lah ada macam-macam ah baju seluar cake barang-barang untuk
socks with his hair ya lepas tu aku nampak dia ada apa tempat list untuk binatang untuk anjing untuk kucing aku nampak dia ada jual barang baju untuk budak-budak aku nampak dia jual barang um

dia punya benda lah
banyak benda-benda dia jual lah
souvenir ah souvenir tak tahu kalau boleh hantar singapore eh kalau boleh aku
I'm going to buy that eh aku nak beli ah one pair is like what three fifty on Shopee so ya I'm gonna buy that then
if I were to wear that socks kalau aku nak pakai itu stokin eh yang donald trump dengan rambut dia terabai keluar macam gitu eh aku kena pakai three quarters uh three quarter pants ah so orang boleh nampak
socks eh nanti aku kena ini sia aku kena pergi apa america eh

mm masuk news ah masuk news keluar kat news alamak leceh lah barang ni leceh lah
he have a plan B lah then the plan B untuk you know carry forward
mm betul
ya ya that's true betul lah
K the first movie that we watched was apa eh
err oh no yesterday yesterday night semalam yang kita tengok cerita um what was the title
dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok

I like the one that you showed me yang cerita unhinged tu oh that one you guys have to watch man
banyak emosi you know emosi tertekan leh aduh that's like ya
betul mm
actually aku tak expect ah
and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped
he actually got a try to find for his wife and then he actually stream live dekat dia punya ah social media when he got caught up with dia punya friend bila dia dah kidnap dia punya wife
yang ah this this this district attorney person dia put
sudah dapat tahu and then um
so ya she was she was ni ah she was ah

ramai juga semalam eh yang berumur-berumur jalan-jalan semua
I think pulau ubin not so bad macritchie is like wah kaki aku sakit eh
dia punya jalan dia is so narrow that aku
ya when I went back island wow my leg kasi pain
it's like aku tengah jalan K depan and she was at the back and then there was this noise like you know if monkey were fighting K if you don't know how monkey fight or how it sounds like you go and YouTube it okay so it was a very loud noise and she actually just take her hand and just pull my neck like
a'ah seh it's like boleh gigit engkau sampai cedera parah oh kau tahu tak
monyet business
the older one is like macam
dia macam sign kau ah dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ah pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
takde air because okay that time eh bila aku pergi bali kan then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there lah and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers lah
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam hmm primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil ah he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like err teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu I think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
I was shocked I was like eh ini biadap eh like I paid because it was so I was so err interested I mean I was so having I was so much having fun
so I kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so I kept buying and then I buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde eh dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so I gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor err apa err maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it lah
ya pasar basah ya
mengeteh lah kopi lah so
I think just old old songs or cerita-cerita lama ya atau pun err they will go to me watch and you know err um buka daripada handphone apps then buka YouTube ah apa
I also err apa tu download err yang apps untuk watch movie ya so wherever he can scroll he scroll ya

the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like

I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know

I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah
eh tapi aku tak faham ah kau punya kerja buat apa
jual besi dah dia punya sales really drop ah
kerja kau ni macam mak mertua aku ah
kau jual besi mak mertua aku ah mak mertua aku jual itu ah ya
right not enough experience lah tu
but your work wise memang dah
kau tak boleh function ah how to function
macam lyn ah sama
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion
ah can ah it's easy it's easy to get what anywhere just add in aje tak payah letak gula it's just to flavour your your air
semua masuk gasak ah
tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni

aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so
sumpah aku tak tahu nyah so he say because of that then they pay me to be the experiment punya person so the money I get I buy this one lah wah sweet lah sangat touched touched lah banyak-banyak
lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi
but it's not like macam okay ah this this this december holidays let's go like you and whenever you go to kau pergi sebab ada family business but then you macam okay we can also chill at the same time is that what you mean
seremban kat mana
I never been there dude the only time I go malaysia is eh I only go to pun macam satu dua kali
from there from um you from but you went there you drove or you naik train
huh what apa kau I don't get it you say thailand now you say england
the atas atas sekali
oh my god that's why I heard this person from singapore dengan kawan dia like naik the motor pergi mana entah like wait
the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view
pastu gi walk you walk from one country to another
I don't know some people do that you know okay some people do that but I swear people who do that gila I cannot seh
like that like that that uh I don't know for you know dekat malaysia this um this orang dia jalan daripada to like ipoh or something just to just so that they can see their punya anak cause of COVID
ya I heard something like that like the father literally walked from one state to another just to just so that they can see the anak
just the just the thought of it macam you think tak [leh]
okay lah I mean kau nak jalan buat apa ye you can take the bus you know you're not in the dire situation to walk
mak I
have you no but you know eh uh few recent juga I exercise my mum I go walk from here to jurong east is not as bad as me walking in the reservoir you know I swear walking in the reservoir is way worse I walk from here to jurong east to like JEM to go eat it's not even that bad
I'm not kidding it's really not that bad it's really not that bad bro I literally walk from here to jurong lake garden I really walked with my cousin I walked the whole time daripada this belakang ni I walk sampai jurong lake garden I swear I'm not kidding I that was really a few days after I balik you know
from the bus stop pastu pergi masuk situ eh
go jurong lake garden but then my cousin satu macam let's go then I'm like okay I guess
like aku aku ah aku ingat kita orang akan stop dekat you know the you know there's like a macam park or something behind science garden eh science garden pula science centre
no apparently where where was like aku jalan jauh-jauh that was only five kilometres
ya like half what almost to bila I nak masuk jurong lake garden that was only five kilometres
I was walking I was walking from behind here you know the old block yang dah tak ada
that that's how I follow the route follow the route uh with um ikut pergi science centre
sorry lah baru balik kan I don't know my directions yet pergi JEM pun susah
dude for real oh my god I felt so stupid my mak kan you know how you can tembus from JEM to no no from JEM you can tembus to west gate west gate can go to ng teng fong to
my dumb ass literally my mum suruh I pergi nak cari barang tau but then aku confident dah pergi kat JEM dah beli barang kan pastu you know how there is also another there's also another shortcut from JEM to be big box
I don't know why my stupid my stupid brain went to the shortcut tapi how you know it's close cause the big box also close so I went to I went I saw the sign and it was the the shortcut was closed tau and then I'm like
oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously lah macam I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital gitu
like the one day two day stay that dekat hospital that kind of thing
I tak dengar seh I didn't know that
chey I tak tahu seh I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
so kau nampak yang hospital
how many rumah dorang nak seh there are so many rumah sekarang kat singapore tak apa pun
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like apa saudi I don't know lah basically dorang nak kick out semua foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
but I mean alhamdulilah lah maybe rezeki it's better to also
actually dia kerja sana buat apa eh
no no there's this one type I mean I think it depends like sometimes he kerja in the office and then sometimes like there's this banyak kali aku bau dia punya freaking oil like I really hated the smell bro it like petroleum punya smell like it was so in the house and I thought was going to die you know
for real bau dia kuat gila
pakai oil semua kan
bila time kerja
it's not busuk but it's like you think you so chemically eh
like you you bila you smell you macam oh my god I'm gonna die
but that one is like macam refine oil macam dah
got difference it's like raw black oil so maybe pasal tu bau dia macam weird sikit
ya duh that's the thing no the thing is about oh bila bapa aku balik I I can't even see any stain on him you know
you mean so angry at the world or your attendance masalah
eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina lah then kan ni sebelum COVID jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama kan jadi saya yang kena pass
uh all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass err find me to another person kan err jadi I just do that lah tapi nanti
the person I pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
oh okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely I want to forget about intern
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
saya pun confused ah tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
um okay K saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school leh
saya saya dapat B three juga agaknya tapi ah
I do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal uh saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain
tapi tapi akhirnya tetap fail

minta break
korang apa dah mata air officially ke tak
okay ah continue aku punya eh
ah aku punya is um
when she said that aku just didn't know how to take it because tu first time aku pe as I said ah macam tu first time aku pe first in everything tau
aku just
aku just tried to apa ni
aku tak layan sesiapa kau tahu macam dorang ajak lepak semua aku nangis and then like obvious ah like nangis semua biasa
ah aku cam emotional emotional gila and then like
orang ajak aku lepak semua then dorang macam tak
or I didn't apa ni
uh didn't go ah macam I
I wasn't feeling it ah so cam aku just stay at home for you could say for someone uh like me
it was a long period of time where aku just stay rumah
and then aku cam
you know like aku stay rumah for like I think
two weeks ah aku rasa dua minggu ah aku stay rumah case bila orang ajak lepak
case bila orang ajak lepak aku cam tak aku tak nak aku tak kasi dorang reason betul lah aku just diam kan diri aku just
buat hal sendiri ah hal sendiri tak kacau orang
and then ya aku just nangis and I just couldn't accept it ah and ah dah gitu takpe aku when uh even though she said she don't want know anything already and like cry and I'm like I was
aku cam aku cam in denial
I don't know ah for someone else to judge for you to judge or what ah like aku cakap dengan dia cam like
ah asal tiba gini cam takleh berbual ke like
tak kan tiba-tiba nak cakap
ah heartless like tak kan dia tak boleh ingat apa like uh apa kita dah lalui ah like everything
and cam
aku dah cuba ah semua benda sia aku cuba in that in the first one but
slowly I realised cam aku tak boleh buat pape ah and at one point ah I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering ah because actually tu
err hari jadi dia
and then dah gitu aku wish ah
bila aku wish terus ah dia cakap her reply was very
and then uh aku diam ah then aku cam dah gitu takpe then macam then dah gitu aku realised aku check ah then aku check WhatsApp and then just realised dia block aku
on WhatsApp dia block aku on Instagram
err every platform yang kita boleh berbual dia block ah basically
and then aku cam but
the last straw and then so aku cam
aku ambil jer ah aku just angkat jer ah apa yang telan jer ah aku just telan apa yang
dia dah tu kira
the last straw so aku tengok that was the
so I just thought like okay ah I guess aku kena I have to let go ah and
it's over the healing process lama sia
like gentle sia healing process lama sia tu first nya but
you know most of the time it's not going to be ah most of the time kau boleh cakap ah kebanyakkan tak ada orang akan last sampai
kahwin ke jannah from the first one tau
so itu apa aku cakap
siapa tak nak kan semua orang nak lah banyak benda sia semua orang nak like cuma
as I said ah macam tadi like
kalau benda semua semua benda kau dapat dalam dunia pun buat apa hidup pe
tak kan apa beza dia kalau kau tanya yang tiga wishes
cam satu benda jer
apa link sia
pape free uh makanan ah
tapi aku tak nak siapa tak nak free makan aku suka makan siapa pun suka makan
kalau boleh hari-hari Pizza Hut pun Pizza Hut sia hari-hari
muak ah tapi cam
okay but ya anyways walaupun kau berbual tak ada link
takpe aku continue story aku pasal aku nak berbual aku nya story
aku feel bad I feel bad for feeling this way
pasal aku dah dengan
aku feel bad a little bad
aku rasa cam it's a crime
pasal for feeling this because
I already have a girl right now okay kau faham kan
aku cam this girl was like
the ah let's say aku rasa cam second minggu of my school week
so basically this girl was the second my second date ah so cam I saw her
uh at this eating place kat sekolah
kat sekolah ah uh terus dah gitu uh
ini pun tapi ya aku dah nampak dia actually funny story is uh
apa yang kelakar is macam
actually aku
kawan aku lagi dua kau kenal juga ah ah actually tak penting ah cam siapa but like aku lagi dua kita dah macam
uh kita dah macam tiga-tiga dah nampak like ni perempuan
and then kita semua cam nak ah tiga-tiga nak cam don't mind try ah kita just main-main time tu time tu kita main-main tak kesah pasal pape ah
because ah aku pun macam rasa aku heartless afterwards
a bit lah maybe exaggeration but I don't think maybe a bit lah and then so aku cam main-main ah tak kesah siapa nak next siapa nak
try try jer ah main-main ah pape jadi jadi ah
and then so cam
kita tiga ah dah gitu kita tiga buat bet siapa kalah pergi minta Instagram
perempuan ni ah and then ah one of them lost ah so cam dia kena pergi minta
err dah gitu kita dah minta
tiga-tiga ah err in the end tiga-tiga dapat pe Instagram dah gitu err
dorang tak jadi ah dorang tak jadi try
ke apa dorang just
dorang pun ada sendiri sendiri nya somehow dorang pun
so aku cam ya I found this girl
to be oh first aku cam
for a few days aku tahan aku tengok story orang dia semua macam mana
aku tak plan pun actually nak
ah through dia nya social media jer ah as in aku tak tahu ah camne because aku belum berbual
so cam aku tengok jer ah dia nya social media dia macam mana
dia okay
so aku cam oh dia okay jer actually
because like aku found dia punya stories to be entertaining
kau tahu cam Instagram stories dia
uh cam entertaining
abeh cam kelakar kelakar it's really kelakar even for me you know
dah gitu uh
you know uh I was aku tried to aku go ahead ah and then uh aku tried to her ah and then
oh but I thought I was a little heartless maybe exaggerate ah cam
aku dia and then err
to to say ah love at first sight cam
pun exaggeration ah cam lebih ah tapi cam I like her a lot ah
at one point kan I could say bukan cakap not bad ah aku boleh cakap sempurna sia
dia cam dia cam uh ya ni ni ah ni ah this is the one ah this one I thought like oh
so kita continue so we talk we talk we talk berbual berbual berbual
sometimes we misunderstood each other it's okay because uh benda ni semua normal pe
ah so dah gitu takpe ah then
on that day tak salah aku sejuk
nak mampus ah aku cakap dengan kau sejuk nak mampus tak tahu asal it wasn't dia nak hujan dia sebelum hujan and then
aku pun demam so menambah ah sejuk
bertambah sejuk aku cam apa ni time tu tiba-tiba kita berbual ah on that day it was normal tau semua benda normal
kita berbual cam biasa uh
and then tiba-tiba dia cakap err dia ada benda nak bilang aku
then aku cam huh apa dia aku cam tak fikir buruk ah pasal apa yang nak jadi
so terus dia cakap
yang dia dah tak terus aku tanya ah
what's wrong apa jadi apa asal abeh apa yang dia nak bilang aku ah and then aku cakap ah like
ah terus dia bilang ah ah she said that
sama ah sama macam yang first nya macam just tiba
abeh aku macam uh ah what do you mean ah
and then ah dia cakap ah macam
somehow dia nya feelings dah lost ah
abeh macam dia dah lose feelings ah terus
aku cam huh asal seh boleh tiba gitu I thought everything was going good
imperfect ways I saw perfectness ah to me lah I aku nak honest ah like ni I know it's like very
the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like macam guilt trip sikit ah but
ini I just learnt like okay lah I cannot do anything about it what
itu apa yang penting ah untuk aku like ah apa ni kebahagiaan dia
so kalau dia bahagia aku okay ah
aku cam cakap dengan dia then aku just cakap dengan dia okay ah if that's what you want then I love you enough ah untuk aku I love you I love her enough to let her go ah untuk lepas kan dia
so then aku cam
okay ah apa ni
the day uh apa eh
so aku just cakap ah I just give her a long note I said err all the best in life ah kalau dia perlu kan pape I will still be here you know I'll still be a friend if you want to consider me that you know ah whatever it is know I've always care for you
aku just cam
so aku just accepted how it was and how it is
and aku just wanted her to be happy
talk time and time ah again we don't talk everyday so untuk kau okay tak to be aku tanya kau dulu untuk kau okay tak kalau
kau kawan dengan ex kau
untuk kau okay kalau kau kawan dengan ex kau
okay aku faham ah but
okay so kita jadi kawan ah
and then like time and time I ask about her because I still care about her you know I always care you know to me untuk aku in my own
yang ni apa aku nak cakap ah so like
aku cam okay ah takpe as in I I mean lah I was already accepting it ah as it is I just want her to be happy ah kan ada
happy dah cukup
ah apa ni
uh it's just that sometimes we do see each other you know in school because it's the same school what so cam
oh terus aku I I found this girl ah this other girl at

craving for Krispy Kreme punya doughnut
sedap sia dia punya original punya flavour
eh ah ada ke dekat
ya actually aku dah lapar
oh you mean ada kedai baru kat situ
macam entrance ke apa
ah kan kita ada walk past dekat situ
that is like one my favourite and go to things to makan sia time
eh dekat orchard
dekat luar somerset tak salah aku
oh because ada purple line apa kat situ
dekatnya from your rumah
untuk just duduk duduk ke
makan makan sana banyak makanan seh
kalau dah bosan makan itu makan dekat yang luar yang hawker centre sana
ada eh
hari hari ni mak kau masak apa ah
say small portion banyak banyak pun tak apa
tapi kan aku punya small pun tak macam small sangat ah
in the end I I still keep gaining and gaining and gaining masih lah aku punya goals tak capai capai
ya but I want back that body right but okay it's okay reda jer kan apa nak buat
kau kau happy
aku pun happy macam gitu ah
aku aku pun dah malas ah nak jaga jaga sangat
kalau jaga jaga jaga tetap lapar juga so
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan kan telah tutup so like
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh ah and then I also like to tengok pokok
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window eh hari ini ada pokok this colour eh hari ini ada salji eh hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang I fikir macam like
eh then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting ah like err summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about orh the money
and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman

I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product
abeh aqil ada plans tak like to get married before you

then dia just cakap oh err entah just from the way he berbual and like
err interact with people he was very nice lah he was very open he say then he feels macam aqil boleh take care of you

kenapa but I feel like it won't be so much of an issue though
ya tapi takkan al-fatihah pun dia tak tahu
tapi it's it's not ah macam mana nak cakap eh it's not so difficult as
I mean if aqil is uh willing to work towards that I don't think it'll be much of an issue ah like he yang willingly nak try for try to do it you know instead of err dia buat macam gini sebab your parents macam suruh or dia buat macam gini just to impress your parents I think macam this kind of thing at the end of the day I guess it will affect you
parents semua gitu what even my mum pun macam gitu what

siapa my mum
no lah entah eh she knows I have my own perangai he has his own perangai also macam when we quarrel or apa

 macam mana eh  nak kalau ah dah eh  kalau salah salah tak dapat apa-apa buang masa kan ah then ah  cakap okay lah nevermind ya ya ah
then I saw on this cardboard ah gambar manchester  gambar of the city and then they on the bottom they said you are going to manchester
ah then I was dah stun ah  tengok dalam hati
 apa ni takde benda apa macam ingat macam boot or apa ah player one of the player sign the boot or something because is is like a shoebox size
 bukak cardboard  apa itu aja but it didn't hit me you know I was was waiting  macam very slow reaction was like
what like  terus dah  terlompat-lompat kat situ
so is a is a is a is a um fully paid trip for seven days  pergi uh their
stadium  jumpa the player  pergi their training ground ah everything was
a fan lah ah so so that photo was actually  kat the their  apa ni training training ground their training ground so we we had a a a small football tournament between the winners from other countries
okay uh can no worries I I'll arrange everything so I went back to  kerja they are but said this was during lunch time so  lambat ah so I went back to  kerja I went to my manager lah first she look at me alif where have you been K ah I have a very cool story to tell you you're not gonna believe it but
you have to believe it I it happen lah so I told her the whole story lah then after like ten minutes of talking to her  dia cakap alif  kalau dah  lambat cakap aja lambat tak payah come up with all these stories
 cakap ah are you sure
so ah I just had that as my proof so-called proof so I  balik I told my wife my wife  pun tak percaya
then the the whole night I was waiting at my email reflect reflect check check check then about two three in the morning an email came in and it's the confirmation lah everything lah they need my detail passport  apa semua
I woke my wife ah you see you see  tengok see is real I'm not lying I'm not dreaming is real
ya this guy replied lah okay okay I I can take you I can take you okay we go then  yang lain semua eh  tak fair seh  aku tak tak baca pun aku tengah kerja ah I didn't read your message ah then sorry man I
we so we we went for one week lah that was time of my life man ya  jumpa
player free travel free hotel everything I just need to spend  duit belanja lah
from from mana ah ah
if central central paris ke the outskirts
ah ah ah okay the  ada eiffel tower
that that that time we  kita pergi night train from london
so  kita jalan lah  jalan around the area
jalan from the train the the
train  semua what what's the train say the
ah  jalan through the streets know sightseeing always  sampai the
um yup then some ya pernah but okay lah they are they are okay ah
then from there ah yup ah  satu naik stroller ah  satu the the smallest one ah ah mm
ya ya ya ya banyak halal ya ya correct
 dari from  apa ni the loop  kita naik dia ada apa the the river tour eh
ah river tour the the sand sand river all that  semua ah ah
ah ya ya ah ah we are  kita punya is just the the sightseeing just the  duduk-duduk tengok-tengok
ah then then  situ kira macam rest lah
we still have the picture the exact same picture that uh it was that was on the news  yang dah  terbakar
architecture we ah  kita kita jalan ah all the way  jalan
apa from from gare du nord  jalan around the area
the english guys oh  paris is dirty but to me  dua-dua equally dirty the difference is paris has ah more sightseeing places
the the  dekat-dekat first ah
then there's there's this  apa shopping mall  baru lah  apa nama dia they
 dorang betul-betul cater  untuk singaporeans but because I went there
 besar-besar lah the poster uh you can use Nets here Nets is a singapore thing what right so
literally every shop in that mall I think is paradigm ah I I can't remember the name you  boleh pakai Nets so it's obviously catered for singaporeans what
mm  nak kena tukar
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
oh my god adik I think you're thinking too much eh
cause like I mean it's a zoo what dorang confirm jaga punya
oh my god I nak pergi
a'ah angin
spa and like massage kat Singapore but mahal seh
ya you know I kena gigit dengan mosquito
dengue fever nya mosquito seh
berapa ah dia buat
oh my god I nak buat my gigi juga seh
I takut dentist marah I though
cause I tak jaga my teeth
I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough
then macam
tak lah tu group member lain lah you tak dengar betul eh
like like I see like ramai orang macam
they just keep it in you know and lambat laun it will be very bad for them
so you pergi yang mana satu
northpoint asal you nak gi northpoint eh
oh ya I scared you tired seh besok you kerja so maybe you just take J cube
tapi I nak bawa
cause uh I think kat rumah
mentos um you know yang the
ah I not sure but I know dia cuma ada apa eh
kita boleh like
eh I suka seh curtain you
a'ah eh tapi your aircon seram seh dia tengok macam ada dua mata tengok
eh actually kan I tempted nak pergi funan mall seh besok sebab I nak beli cookie
maybe cause I nak cookie
a'ah I boleh pakai student
tapi I I belum um
I belum send lagi
I belum buat uh student pass
tak ah tak student price ah
macam my kerja all macam eh my classes all macam habis pukul enam right
so I takde time nak pergi
ya that time I nampak my bank kan dorang minus
macam sixteen dollars per week you know
and it doesn't help cause like my way of commuting is uh to naik bus what then bus selalu ada macam they take the longer route what so that's why ah
um means ada ke tak ah
wow mahal pe
which really makes me feel like macam oh my god to work really hard
kenapa seh
some of it is very very small leh then I tak suka seh
I don't like to feel macam claustrophobic seh
a'ah seh I nampak then I was like why
ya I nak seh but like hello helicopter for what
ya I'm awake kenapa
I know kita kena buat sampai enam puluh seh
okay bagus
no I ada cakap dengan you I just
no that time I bilang you dah enam puluh
why is it ah he like macam affected cause you you cakap kenapa tak berbual melayu dengan dia
oh why that day you rabak is it or what
mesti dia macam I remember dah penat
I mean I rasa
buat orang penat and like ya
I think it's good lah yang you all just
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
cause it's easier then later bila nak pergi kedai ke apa kan itu semua kan senang sikit apa macam I had macam
sekarang macam senang takut mengandung sebelah sebelah orang senang daripada jauh jauh daripada orang semua
eh tak lah merepek tak tak tak tak no lah
eh nonsense nonsense ah no lah then if like my other wishes is macam I want to have like a lot of money so I can do my business all able to do the stuff and all ya
ah nak banyak duit banyak
no as in cause ten K some money I save up and then I go like I do my stuff I do my own business cause nak
I don't wish to be that much to have that much straight way begitu you know I don't expect much even if it's a wish I don't expect much
then if it's you if you have this three wishes apa
oh sikit setakat kalau gitu the tiga wish is
to like tak nak jadi tua
I mean a friendly vampire is not that bad eh boleh pe it's like always
jadi macam goblin lor jadi macam goblin

marah pe
is it ada jual dekat your house area
oh cause bilik spare
pasal okay
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing ah dia
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier ah
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku lah ah this one guy
I mean I think you can guess lah who what what this entity is lah rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
kawan aku texted me
ah my our mutual friend dia cakap
eh apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
in a bit I thought he was kidding ah cause aku saw the pictures eh ni legit sia
so I call him ah called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet eh
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply ah
abeh dia cakap oh tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dah<malay>lama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor wafan which is our friend ah
aku tak kasi nombor wafan abeh I don't know how they got wafan number
abeh aku macam okay ah initially aku percaya dia ah then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone ah yang kena
eh afan kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from
ah clarifying you abeh cakap ah do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that one my friend
macam okay ah
abeh lepastu ah ah then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from ah standard lah nak verify
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak kan ya
so that afterwards aku macam oh
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this ah macam
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage pe semalam
abeh macam we were just
abeh terus when I call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly ah kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards I ask him
yang that time this one
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
what you claim it was ke ini
abeh dia cakap ah actually betul lah gitu then asal kau tipu
kau tell us lah when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly ah abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
aku dah macam dah haiya
oh tu aku tak aku tak sure ah but he can go there ah
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday eh this morning ke yesterday he said
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so I don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap eh yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
eh no ya five ke march I can't remember
ya aku okay ah cause he's been a good
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another lah that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
you know you know those kind of people apa
snowball anjing
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah lah
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks macam ye lah paiseh ah
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua kan
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh
tak tahu ah
ah aku find that
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer ah
masai sia tak iron
um so aku
you know lose not losing weight apa
he said he was at her play ah their place ah her place there there so long if he was their place he and din this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his balding tak penting ah but
both of them went over to fahim place abeh ah ruqayyah was asleep
macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six
tak not there's some most nya chart would say aku average ah
oh local nya eh
yup you have a point ah pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
I should look into the maybe atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai lah
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti ah
aku tak tahu ah
kau lain ah
ya takleh cakap sekarang
then they took a took a picture lepastu aku perasan macam
eh aku dah gemuk gila ke apa
then I macam
ya I show you before ya which which is good lah then I was not expecting that turn ah which really changed everything ah aku stop drinking sweet things exclusively I used to drink flavoured drinks exclusively and I stop
there's a while aku really crave teh then aku macam okay lah we go buy teh then I think so okay ah
not so lah couldn't not really heavily addicted to food kau tahu macam people some eat a lot of gluttony gonna shit I don't lah
german nya the vacuum guy
I think so but I forgot or you never did I am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
sardin pe
like some people tak change their passport semua they just
change for the heck of it macam kau tahu you get the conversion card kan
macam grudgingly ah
oh as in the whole ah like handling the zakat
oh ya ya ya tu aku agree ah I have to agree with that correct
so ni semua subjective pe
siapa they both
your dad ke your mum
who she she tak
is it one of those macam trial lessons
no some people think of it that way macam are you sure you want to stoop this low and want to marry asian some people which fucked up lah but then some people really think of it that way I can do it
ah so aku tak tahu ah macam maybe just tell her that
tapi if I know switzerland is doing ke australia forgot like german speaking country it's not
so mak
why the sewa murah
makan hotdog pun dah marah
in school setiap kali I bring back food then you marah

yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan kan
ya different dia tak ada then three years her course was just three years
so dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana
india pun ada north india
tak nak malas because very expensive what
uh that one aku dah check semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil
and then bawah itu ada spain I think semua
so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
nama saya nadi
enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora
macam step lawa jer shiny shiny macam dia setakat over then I dengar eh tak nak nanyi let it go
to jer dia tahu
fighter what is this dragon apa ini dragon rider
eh dia jadi dragon ini bukan jadi dragon rider
entah lah apa lah aku tak pernah nampak character itu ini lah what's in the league
I think kalau ada background music untuk aku punya balmond kan nanti bila dia buat yang ulti itu dengar quack
but okay lor balmond aku think
no okay why aku choose balmond kan because when my sister um she just started playing so you have new characters to play
so aku
okay at least kau sedar diri then boleh lah
kau jangan step jadi tank yu zhong ke apa dragon orang semua ingat kau nak dragon up ke dragon tales
dia macam hype sekarang
ah dia orang dia orang revamp hilda and like really give her
so korang semua recall kan this hilda sneaky dia dekat dalam bush and she's just recovering health consistently
kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh
entah masuk meeting macam mana itu kidding lah
nak buat apa dengan kita punya container tank itu eh
so nak plan macam mana
kita check in abeh tidur
I think I uh I ask him afterwards kita berbual lain lah but then
um okay wait let's go back to the main topic kita staycation
then he was like okay first day mm check in tidur then my kawan like are you serious bro
but okay lor I mean first day check kita can rest dulu lah but then
dia dapat one week tau one week like he don't have to dia tak payah kerja satu minggu seh
kau tau tak the company standard is before like kalau the end of you know before the new year eh new year the same thing lah before the end of the year
like everyone all the all the employees dia orang dapat one week
oh but his one week kan then he tell me so kalau that one week dia tak pergi mana mana
pergi gym everyday lah then aku macam eh
kau tahu tak bila itu hari kita pergi gym kan
dia dah baring dekat bench
dah dia baring abeh dia nak tidur then aku macam fikir kau nak pergi gym hari-hari ke are you okay girl I I don't want to see that happening man
no kita kena pergi
ada along the way oh wait ah there's andes
oh man I forgot where's that tak kan airport eh no we're not grabbing please eh he's already
aku aku nak split pun dia tak kasi
it could be a full court also I don't know why I say andes this is the first thing that pop up I think cause recently pergi airport abeh pergi andes
macam lain sikit ah
tapi aku andes pun bukan punya aku makan ayam aku makan
then after lunch then I think by two then kita
I can blend my nasi gorengnya my nasi gorengnya what is it called apa itu um
rempah you mean
ah yes rempah then like fast game boring lah
or is it too too melampau
nanti you take over cause I might just end up
you gonna spend eighty five dollars on a care bear punya baju okay wait if you want to buy the baju just the baju and then you wear like jeans
why why why would you spend on that care bear baju and then wear outside
with the care bear baju and seluar
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob kaki pakai care bear shorts
err okay first day kita check in then lepas check in
eh no no first day lepas dah pack
then lepas dah check in
I think we can save to say kita rest
dinner kita makan luar like around the area just get the feel of

lepas trampoline park kan dah sweaty sweaty semua the first thing that we're going to come out of haizat mouth is let's grab back ah I mean wait wait wait wait trampoline park dekat mana
okay lah I mean I don't mind grabbing there first cause like if we're about to I think I'd rather we just like wake up early then start our day early lah then macam

boleh lah time to rank up lah bro
wah so shiok to wake up on a monday to atas view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is ulu but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
no lah but at the rate like we are walking like ulu hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot tahan is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
their customer their customer base quite like a lot what people go there and makan like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like err sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like lim kopi like lunch hour people take their own time
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the macam the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like oh ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
no not ayam merah the there there is this minang store in lucky
ah indoor and I like because they have this sapi goreng or empal ya ya that one is nice it's not bad I brought risa there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because the husband kena heart attack what but that one heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also kena lah
macam over the past twenty years
diabetic sana
she was eating a whole plate of tauge
tahu and all but but the bulk of it is tauge and I'm like she is eating one big plate of tauge I'm like okay healthy people
ya they're forced lah like die die die die must do what because like oh shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin like quite embarrassing lah or like macam you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said ugh she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the Rolex centre cause we atas
at where oh so much for like not atas and then want to shop some more
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right habis
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like macam events like like events ah
you should wear plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like err hijab so it's not so jialat it's like
jangan berangan lah please
okay you know what if if we don't get it then it's okay we can just err balik I mean like whatever I just if if we if have I will dabao and buy
rabak lah this one if if they tow away no if clams still can remove if they tow away it's gonna be another problem trying to like find the freaking bike cause it's like where is your bike why you why you ya so
chai chee like really bedok chai chee like really very err what's that called it's just really very ulu lah
so if you staycay in dekat town hall to see you
err no merepek lah but six hundred is expensive mahal
mana ada momok it's it's padang what
no it's gonna be operational in jan but leceh because it's malaysia so they're err authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
hello adik how was your day
itu jer
kita tak celebrate
not tak celebrate like macam tak
but you know like macam it's not that special it's just another day gitu but we did we did wish each wish each other

five dollar jer seh dia punya template
is it raining I love the weather this past few days adik do you want to know what happened to me
and the earliest slot of is january so by the time like I sudah habis my is already

salah saya I'm just telling you
you know when she looks at the kakak she's like
because mala the rempah dia sama tapi like the ingredients you can switch it up you know what I mean
like macam this guy
his dia melayu dia
nama dia zul
a lot of the people in the like they always look down on him ah not look down lah like macam
macam cakap ee ketot then after that he cried you know oh my god
they'll be like eh kenapa kau kau nangis aku tak faham gitu
I say tapi kau rugi because
his whole tuition fee has been sponsored by MENDAKI apa
so kirakan it's like free education and you could just going to like
then dia orang punya written test also like he say is not that hard
sampai I don't know because I took a nap from five
like macam he thinks that he knows how to code
tapi now
is it like the japanese punya types of you know those big sandwiches

adik mirza
dia tak ada kids messenger right it's only dia punya kakak right
I think you guys should've like incorporated those old school punya
lagu like um lagus that they reminisce to instead of like now

dia mesti tak jaga betul-betul is it
tak baik dia pergi kidnap
this situation of like he thinks it's a pontianak
and they need to make some rounds lah around the ammunition punya dump area
tempat that is very keras you know
abah keep quiet I'm recording
yup and like this err tempat is like damn keras behind it's like
so this guy the chinese guy dia macam action tau dia macam like okay lah
like the forested area lah dekat belakang the ammunition dump
the chinese guy keeps keeps on like he was being persistent lah like eh jom ah let's go let's go plus I playing like some songs so you don't need to hear anything
like someone err I don't know ah like macam like you know err how
pontianaks in in movies like before they appear dia orang nyanyi macam mm
encik ah he say encik I I don't want to go back ah
ya that's it but he didn't he didn't like macam
ya then dia orang pun bodoh dia orang pun bodoh still want to go there not dia orang ah like
tapi like we are living separate life like I feel like as long as we don't kacau them they don't kacau us you know what I mean
but why sometimes when I listen to ghost stories they attack without like macam any reason
like you know the puaka
beginning of december dia orang
so in the end my my friend dia belikan dia punya boyfriend dia
then I told you might as well buy like macam Tommy Hilfiger but it's still the same price ninety nine dollar

tomorrow pukul berapa kau orang meet
okay boleh
wait avengers pasal apa
captain america tak nak
what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu
did you just see the the the one yang uh andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
ya aku tengok kat suntec tak tak salah
tak yang movie yang err real life action nya aku tak ingat siapa yang
sedih pe rumah kita kotak-kotak dok kau serious
apa dorang jual dekat supermarket
okay so kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam norway kau rasa boleh jalan
confirm ada banyak order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore punya let's say err four room flat
amenities tak ada
so ya I think you really have to see dia punya apa ni culture
eh siala rabak sia
aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash
kau fikir aku kena aku patut beli sekarang eh kalau sembilan dolar

ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so nanti dia accumulate accumulate ah then one day bam oh spark fire
eh dok Tiktok aku dah obsessed tau dengan Tiktok
tapi itu tak pakai that kind of idea untuk business kau sendiri
orh itu lah inspirasi kau orh dia filter tu glove putih glove apa lagi kau nak
kau tak ada glove oven sekali
yang penting aku angguk muffin
mungkin kau punya hidung boleh ni ah boleh sense kau tahu yang mingles dia boleh sense the weather berapa degrees
err aku kena unlock phone jap eh
um nak masuk tiga puluh lima minit
okay kita harus berbual
lagi sikit lagi jap maths aku tak bagus
satu jam enam puluh minit kan betul lah maaf ye saya mengajar seni lukis okay siapa eh
months adam has been obsessed with like watching documentaries so every single night before we sleep but he finds it as an entertainment so dia tengok um macam YouTube nya video semua
abeh dia ketawa-ketawa sendiri aku bingit lah macam like sial ah sis nak tidur sia kau takmo ah abeh buka kuat-kuat pula tu bukan nak pakai earpiece
then bro ya so like err I mean it's entertaining to them because like you know trump super confident so he's like in a way find this macam like a a filler for him to before you sleeps ya so aku first macam annoyed ah but then like err it's one day one night that I actually joined him is quite funny actually cause of the trump being himself ya allah
ketawa siak

so but tak banyak ah cause it's
aku tak tahu aku tak ingat ni semua adam punya ya cause okay aku tahu this is not a good way to do it but because my husband is a agent so aku serahkan semua kepada dia so macam like uh my mother is a bit upset ah macam like okay mean
um everything on the table what if you know what if what if right so that would be on me lah if let's say anything happens but aku sekarang macam like nak tahu benda ni semua pasal insurance investment aku macam segan sikit so bila aku nak tahu nanti aku tanya because it's just that that's why can you stop asking

a'ah dia macam like ah dia ada macam paragraph lepas tu ada macam like uh uh err apa ni bukan fill in the blanks macam just blank blank blank kat tepi tau so macam in this certain line kau cari idea dia
so macam like if the for example the word err the sentence is this is the is the whatever then error is the repeated lah the is just write there is
ya basically macam eh it's vetting kau vetting proof reading its a proof reading exercise I am so jelly they don't have summary anymore
aku tak faham sia

hey Alexa buka anak metropolitan
since last year tak salah okay I know this year dah memang ada
biasanya sec one sec two sec three
and apa-apa whatever small activity last one will be end of the year exam
ya so kalau kau screw up technically kau boleh screwed up the first three but then kau tak back up and kau tak belajar ke apa eh kau tak faham
but is that they want to like macam lessen dia punya
camne nak cakap eh
to the free time I won't say free time macam
dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit it depends on how you see it
sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful ada tiga major tiga exam tiga peperiksaan ada common test ada mid year ada end of the year
aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do
online tak online dorang tak belajar langsung
siak aku bingit siak nak ajar dorang online satu ah selalu problem apa camera
cikgu tak boleh nampak ah cher cannot see you pasal aku tak on lah bodoh its like err okay teacher cannot hear you then you unmute lah ada message cher I just woke up
kau ingat apa invitation apa so macam err
um I will have to ask I don't know why macam like aku tak tahu pasal err budak-budak ni kan dorang baru bangun ke tak biasa dengan online punya attendance taking so dorang macam lemak sikit
example eh budak-budak ni nama dia azmi
dia tak dia bukan online ah dia dia dia dia tengah tidur ke apa
okay can anyone call azmi please terus senyap
um everyone can hear me right nod nod will be nice tak ada sikit ah satu dua tiga budak aku nod okay can you call azmi senyap
then aku macam sial ah apa siak
kau tahu aku kena call azmi pe sekarang then lepas tu aku type dia punya yang class monitor ya aku err tapi dorang tak respond I don't know they are scared to talk online or something to show their face oh my god so difficult aku tak tahu how ugly they look dude I seen you in school I know how you look like for goodness sake nobody cares oh my god aku nya online tau aku busy online aku pilih debate so technically its gonna be very hard the thing is we talk and we need to see each other face
to react on the on the reactions lah ada budak perempuan ni err kat rumah kan so tak payah ikat rambut ah boleh rembang kan semua aku rasa dia baru habis mandi dia main rambut dia kanan ke kiri twirl twirl twirl abeh senyum-senyum sendiri kat handphone eh sial ah aku bingit sia aku ambil video abeh aku tunjuk kawan-kawan aku
super annoying why she trying to flirt with me oh my god I I dah stress then lepas tu aku message one of the err the student in the senior aku message eh tengok kena annoying aku cakap dia suka budak err yang dekat eh dia cakap ah ada satu laki dia nak cui
dia tengah so annoying oh my god gini gini sial lah aku takleh concentrate sia
pasal some kan that point of time they were having like like err field training so the coach was lecturing tak kan aku nak excuse me sorry ah

um entah girl ah jap lagi lagi sikit jer
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe

saya pegang your tangan
kita sama-sama jalan to the
to the to the to the to the tempat lah to the destination we don't
saya cakap saya akan tolak awak sampai awak to your destination which is become doctor
when I tolak you right
I have to stand be stand I have to diri belakang awak untuk tolak
so if I tolak you
oh betul oh serious
he too forward you very behind he think also like alamak this girl dah bodoh lah tak payah ya lah tak payah ah
true I listen to your story also my my hati very sakit for you
ah lelaki macam gini memang tak guna eh
he like think the girls sampah
eh no no not sampah sorry sorry girls uh she dating like girls like mainan no like toys the thick girls like as if they are like my stuffed toy you see my stuffed toy I want when at night I
ya that's why that's why I say um lelaki macam gitu the they think the perempuan-perempuan semua like mainan but actually no no no we are we maruah diri
saya punya earpiece uh low battery
the haprak ah the airpods
haprak sis airpods
tak boleh harap airpod
kalau my earpiece die I pause for a while lah must pause okay sis
but we left one minute but my earpiece I know arwah it's gonna die soon
I'm so hungry lah alah I want to go and makan I don't care after this
amazing ah I cakap dalam bahasa melayu
macam I know from your face
uh huh uh my one no need to enter the room my cahaya know is um dari dari my muka dah macam everybody look everybody like I need nili lah I need nili I no need torchlight what is torchlight
a'ah sis I wanna makan soon
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah
nak buat apa five year aku tak tahu aku cakap macam oh definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role lah but you know like also like macam okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
I was like apa seh nak cakap
I aspire to inspire kau nampak kau nampak
yes so ah I had like three interviews and then um so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews err no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so um I felt that macam this company is kan and and
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no lah no lah no lah satu tahun then coming july dua tahun
cepat juga kan I feel like macam wah all the job demands macam I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague masuk kan beberapa macam
berlega sikit lah hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like oh like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
but I really wanted that tengah estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five jauh seh
because my fiance dia tak ada passion nak pergi sangat to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
not not like what's in it for you but more of macam
uh role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem kan so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny macam we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy ah you know I want to save money ah now now tough time lah cannot spend lah
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists bukan bukan local aku takut
boleh bah certain certain countries can come in singapore already what
so macam like a the same thing lah okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot lah no cannot spend lah now err must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars

mm aku tak tahu ah macam mana nak bagi kau tips but because like it really depends on your course since I was in biomed kan more of my assignment was more into like theory based punya</malay

um ahead kau nak pergi staycation err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
mm actually that place one pun bagus juga ah I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio

tak salah aku ah
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat shangri la how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
he said the food there nice lah but tak halal lah
mm ya maybe we should ah but we really have to plan well I guess I mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it lah maybe I ca
ya I remember pemalas malas nak jalan oh I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
aku recommend kau pergi I mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff mm cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad lah it's affordable and other than tha
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu

I mean ya lah aku tahu during secondary school I was a nerd lah cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school lah lelaki semua pecah sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah
a few days you can come to work kan macam tak fair seh kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam</malay

tak ada tak ada semangat faham tak dia macam tak ada semangat nak pergi then aku pun tak ada semangat nak plan and pergi
you know macam like it's an outing with friends
but nanti macam
kekok macam kekok nanti aku berbual dengan afiq kena jaga jaga mulut sikit macam macam tak tak natural lah  tak tak apa ini
tak lah tak lah no lah okay lah no I just kidding ah but then like they already say what groups of five maximum but then they want to go break those rules
kita uh kita bermula berbual dalam bahasa melayu
kita just
kita just
kita just bermula dengan apa-apa yang kita boleh uh berbahas
though aku tak tahu lah aku punya melayu just rabak
aku punya bahasa melayu boleh berbual but tetapi
ini aku tak tahu kalau saya berbual melayu
tapi gitu lah
begitu lah
kamu kamu belajar um
anda anda anda belajar err bahasa melayu
eh kita berbual macam bahasa pasar aku rasa pasal aku aku mencuba
berbual dalam bahasa pasar kadang-kadang perkataan perkataan inggeris akan termasuk dalam jadi saya and
ah perkataan inggeris akan termasuk dalam
memusnahkan memusnahkan recording ini
apa eh awak lah bilang saya
oh rakaman macam saya
macam mana saya boleh ingat macam mana hendak mana saya boleh macam mana saya boleh terlupa benda macam gini senang senang boleh terlupa tak bagus ini
ya allah susahnya ini sejak saya
sudah habis err
peperiksaan melayu A levels saya tidak gunakan
yang formal
ah dia akan termasuk tanpa pemikiran
lebih baik uh
saya boleh I can control okay I can control better when I speak formal malay like so that no
okay berbalik dengan berbual dalam bahasa melayu sekarang
kerana saya takut err bahasa melayu kita tak cukup
sekarang kita hampir nak dekat uh satu jam saya tak tahu kalau kita nak extend satu dua minit just berbual bahasa melayu
uh kau did you realise just now that I just said the word just
okay kita sudah hampir sudah sampai lepas satu jam
jadi kita try
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah
so bila kita dah peluh
ah more water is put in ourselves and we will kita akan rasa hydrated lah
ah and you can also read the minds of all the makcik-makcik what they are talking about between each other
nanti tak baik lah kalau orang tengok kita macam err orang jahat tapi padahal kita biasa-biasa jer
hmm kalau aku I feel that
I aku akan belajar err what what's that photo photo memory

terima kasih bye bye
betul tu I fully agree I fully agree ya I pun tengok the changi airport ada banyak benda nak buat eh I heard ah dekat changi airport ada this changi village kan ada what this ah steamboat or barbecue thingy what's the name of the restaurant I can't really ingat ah
oh ya that that's amazing that's amazing okay ah I don't mind go tonight I ask adam ah whether he wants to go or not so I mean I I think adam tengah dia mengidam want to eat beef there got beef ke tak ah
ah andes andes andes kat sebelah jer kan
oh okay lah I tak tahu I I think sedap mania would be good ah some more it's like you know the barbecue smell the charcoal kind of smell you know then balik semua bau baju bau gitu someone so
so oh ah ya lah ya lah but lepas tu ya maybe after kita dah makan duduk sana and then we can go over to changi airport can cycle look at what touristic mile thingy will be quite cool quite cool ya
then apa tu siapa lagi ah might follow ah
no he had nothing I pun tak tahu lah why he so tired
ah ya lah I mean kalau kita tak jadi pergi malam ni then maybe we can think about like going maybe like the seletar cafe or something
oh ya actually kan kalau kita car lite to there will it be expensive or cheap ah
oh ya true true sinopec ya very cheap but one thing ah I pump minyak by sinopec minyak ni macam
cepat habis ah minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so I'm like what's happening here ah
a'ah lah agaknya ah letak air
ah yang your your buku you borrow you start reading already or not
I think ada punya cari eatigo eh let me tengok eatigo pun okay juga eh kita boleh rasa makanan dia like like
harga dia pun err ah berpatutan betul betul
um okay by the way I baru check eatigo ah hari ini memang ada lima puluh percent so err selain dining in the garden ada apa lagi eh
tak I will I will think changi village will be a good idea lah tapi adam tak nak pergi ah adam ya
nanti I kena pujuk lah I punya adik untuk nak pergi kedai changi village cause I pun macam nak rasa makan barbecue barbecue but somehow I pergi sana akan makan cheese tofu sahaja so
eh lapar ah
ya kejap I tanya adam adam you nak pergi ke tak
adam dia cakap dia tak nak
I pun tak tahu ah adam cakap dia nak jinjja
dekat mana eh dekat
ah jewel boleh juga kat jewel
dia boleh tengok tengok aeroplane juga dekat jewel
I rasa tak
a'ah eh dekat hub ada kan
oh betul tu
it's like how to say ah it's like macam jinjja chicken oh oh no no it's like uh wing stop wing zone that one
okay lah ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap sia
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to jinjja chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or ah it's that one lah macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather sedap mania ah sedap mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest mah right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
oh sounds yummy ya okay apa
ah it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a satay soup base laksa soup base I'm like wah confirm sedap ah macam gitu
baik satay sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
tapi I tengah diet
tapi takpe lah hari ini dimaafkan lah
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana I tak tahu kejap I tanya adik I adam
adik I mata tutup ah tiba-tiba
apa B B nine
err bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni eh mari kita
ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising

like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group
so we got two more weeks actually so okay lah that's ons saturday tak boleh lah
ya lah but really looks good lah this section letak yucks okay
ada ada ada buy as you but we can buy or we can take the tram there also lah if you want
so I can just ah so can ya ya so segway I think interesting lah cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
err they say okay so segway one hour eh I salah kot kejap eh
oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten
you know that's one way lah we can if you want kita pun boleh pergi sea aquarium also ten token and it's it's a tour open ocean discovery tour sea aquarium
tak eh sedap seh I've been to aspirasi
ya or maybe we can go there makan first at seah im the aspirasi then after that we head into sentosa lah because kan nak naik the monorail also it's free what
tapi nak pergi pukul berapa tu kalau saturday malam sangat nanti kena macam rush
I okay tapi it won't happen one pagi
susah um okay lah we put it about three o'clock kita jumpa
ya three two two or three eh what do you mean force rabung maghrib pe
I think adam pernah pergi force rabung and he he say that is okay leh but he went in the day
ya that's why maybe tonight kalau jumpa then he can tell you more about it lah
kalau jumpa lah ya
so ya lagi tiga minit
eh okay lah so next saturday nineteen kita pergi lah what whatever time lah because I think kalau nak morning is gonna be difficult like habis not possible
two o'clock would be a very macam practical time two to three o'clock
um let me see sea aquarium tutup pukul five
pukul lima on saturday also five but we have a tour so I think if I don't know must follow the tour or own time own target so
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee
tak lah tak pakai
eh ada knee guard ke ah
because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what
kejap kejap vendor for what the backdrop
oh habis sekarang
the vendor bail pasal you all make too much changes or the vendor bail pasal you all tak bayar betul-betul
uh huh habis
but not because you guys made banyak changes ah
apa nama company dia
you mean but the company is not father in law dia punya company ah
I see tapi you cakap lah maybe your kerja kasi you freelance
eh vendor tak nak buat dekat you all
the yang this video ni siapa yang minta dia
so the person that I don't really like tu yang siapa tu so this saturday this sunday she will officially become that number one lah
because I know whereby sitting as a board member you can err you will officially can become macam you voluntarily kan volunteer with err providing your remarks and everything kan so called strategic directions when you are just talking and complicating things right
that's like senang kata ah senang kata because too many cooks spoil the broth
the broth tak lah spoil the soup lah wait what's the what's the idiom again apa too many cooks spoil the apa apa soup what serious I suka ah berbual macam
pasal kita no
tak pasal kita pun sejak kita kahwin kan we only kita selalu keluar and berbual macam ini only when kita the before with kids are really easy our window is just like tanya okay dah alright any long conversation do it with a phone kan we are a phone phone ah what conversation ya
kalau lah boleh screenshot jer the text messages and then err verbalise it screenshot the old messages and then we just verbalise the the text messages that would be fun
aiyo I'm just thinking uh okay I'm just thinking yang sunday ni this sunday ni eh kejap you sunday eh this saturday you kerja kan sunday ada apa wait there's something on happening on saturday orh eddie kahwin habis why why your reaction like that
no but how do I tell my father that he can't come wait kita punya wedding is for what time to what time ah two hours jer kat pasir ris lah kan okay two thirty to four can nanti kita kita naik teksi sana unless you want to go the downtown east ah lepas tu
nak pergi downtown east tak lepas tu I don't know ya but I think nak kena book ah you know nak kena book you know eh no no no tapi I rasa dia orang nak pergi wild wild wet tau boleh kita pergi wild wild wet lepas tu
alah confirm the kids nak main the tayoh
wah that means this weekend we are completely filled alah eh this month siapa punya birthday lagi you cakap
no I mean family lah family siapa eh punya birthday
asal you tak ambil gambar bila you dah dapat kan senang
mm mana ada dah berhenti apa it's not lah ya lah ya lah
sorry ah I pakai contact lens please
kena lah it's just um the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya lah but usually
oh aduh the the the person yang email I ni dah apa tu ya yang tadi I berbual dengan dia tu dia dah email eh oh dia also macam I sama ah a'ah
tak lah what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why a'ah seh kita semua dari tu eh get that experience
dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
eh dah lama tak dengar khabar
um in the group chat lah bodoh
oh my god dia pun beli bija
who are what went downhill kau I mean like dia tak berbual banyak ke pe
and how did you macam mana kau end the thing
kau tengah nangis pe
but also dia pun kawan dia baru itu then like
apa eh um
why do you kenapa kau tak nak dia balik
okay so aku ada crush sikit lah crush sikit jer but like he always say like oh I want date online then I'm like I okay ah cause I already know that's his that's his motto ah like no
of one week or two weeks later dating and online date and okay okay cause they are in the same region so they can game every time so aku pun mengamuk ah ya I mean mengamuk cause like cause we my download timezone with him is different
aku mengamuk then whenever we think he only can like movie when at around my timing two or three and he always fall asleep in the middle of that
so aku like

oh wait you did too with sampah
imessage siapa

oh I can't you know that time giordano the manager was like um so you know how to handle money then she ask me to go to the apa the
I was like you ada
ya then aku pun
faham is are you gonna kau are are you gonna
I just hate you know aku punya teacher ni
she selalu
refer to the slides every time kita ask questions tau
dia suruh kita call dia for consultation then we ask her she asked us to refer to the slides then what's the point of the conversation man what's the point of the call
then I think kita tengah berbual pasal
math punya assignment
I tak faham then
first kau kena tengok dia punya age group
dia this year O level kan
isaac dah dapat grade dia
dah dapat results
they say november punya selalu easy one
aku puji dia sangat cause he really study hard and
and the thing is dia tak brag
aku suka dia sangat I mean
aku nangis sia then I'm like
aku dengar aku dengar dari faith yang dia ada eating
I think dia berbual dengan faith jer cause faith like tak habis-habis chat dengan dia
apa meal plans
ah ada ada red colour yes okay
okay kita kena berbual english and malay
okay cuba cakap
because dia course by united
tapi class ni kenapa dia ah eight hours
mm tapi work from home ah
are you being paid untuk course ni
dah um semalam ada meeting err dekat conference room
ah aku gather all the ten of them lepas tu dalam ya ten of them split into two accounts
so dalam two account tu ada dalam
aku nya old team ada empat orang
err the other team ada enam orang
six six orang dalam team lepas tu kan ada social distancing kan so aku approach err safety manager ah minta pasal aku nak get the message relate to them across um but um I don't want to split the err dua dua team aku nak err two teams to dengar apa aku cakap as one so dorang tak confused
I want them to know the anyway boss aku memang the the day before
dia dah dah cakap dengan aku lah what to say dia cakap firstly about the unpaid cuti tu jangan
jangan bilang customer
don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill
kau tak perasan ke yang bila kau dah stop kerja then work from home ni that your your that your apa tu expenditure is lesser
tak lesser ke
motor masih keep ah
kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik
so aku rasa sebab aku stop the deep station thing ke every night every morning aku consume waktu bulan puasa dengan hari raya
pasal so mana lah aku tahu buat tu ada saffron mana seh nak dapat

in between sebelah ada lagi satu neighbour jiran sebelah kirakan they won't be able to see the
the the scenery ah kirakan window dalam rumah tu semua buka takde view langsung
it's either to a close enclosed space atau um

dia macam shock ah macam tak tahu kan what what to how to what to do pasal dia everyday will will chat on the phone with the girl they don't they don't meet often
kalau meet ada kawan kau ada kawan-kawan together

what for have relationship kalau macam jarang keluar she's very restricted by the family
dia sendiri kata macam I think dia macam can't be bother anymore just call it off lah

then ah nanti time sahur jer nanti dia cakap you will hear she will hear a lot of things macam budak nangis lah perempuan nangis lah kan then I was like thinking
bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah

nanti aku ajak I think I will ask my nephew my cousins these two
we're not into gold yet no no no we're not the makcik makcik who likes wearing gold
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
okay so ya dia nuts he was carrying the table and then after that the the slot just doesn't go in mengamuk ah then I don't understand it's like julie was trying to tell him to just carry the thing out just carry the table out like which I said then he was like no no no no cannot carry because the thing is not locked I was like sudah lah just angkat jer lah he wants to have the table locked jadi dia punya tu a catch under the table I know right that's a assault ya allah lepas tu bising-bising I don't get it tapi si julie macam just angkat jer lah kau then kita tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh like lock lock
hello who's that okay so ya ya so what's the story about the makcik seth ya
bodoh nak mamps
I told my friend about him then he's like oh oh oh okay he doesn't know her but like macam bodoh sekali then I was like saying no bodoh is an understatement this is really beyond bodoh B B but I don't know

empat minit I think this one is created for
tapi ni baru beli last year
ah october I was in hawaii going to oslo beli beli beli
at least I got this stage the other one jap tadi tak boleh
continue lagi dua setengah minit then we can stop already
okay harris we are surviving this err terima kasih lah kerana
hancur melayu participate macam tu eh participate uh terima kasih kerana berbual dengan saya atas voice recording err thanks thanks very much for helping me with this project and
kalau boleh mungkin next time again lah but
because sometimes when you speak melayu and english it's not it's not difficult to switch but I mean
I think when you cannot find the right word in english then you will like or the brain will just tukar-tukar
check bank siapa nak check siapa nak bank
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
first of all I want to know right shu tu siapa
eh shura kau nak pergi kau nak err interview abang ah abang aku abang aku awesome tahu kau tahu tak

so macam uh I I'm kind of disappointed lah that
it's always guy on guy it's guy macam there's a recent rise right on guy on guy crime
so macam it it it kind of pisses me off ah
hostel punya the hostel environment ah
ya most of the incidents happen at hostel punya area do you know that do you know that
I really really needed to take to take a piss nak cepat-cepat kencing and it really cannot tahan punya
we wanted to use the complex punya toilet right but there was so many people

he was the one who told me kan yang
I for one right can tell them to kirim salam lah

abang kosh
the sister is dee kosh punya sister
what are influencers influencers buat apa
so am I right to say right am I right to say eh ted bundy pun influencer
ted bundy pun influencer
tapi lifestyle dia orang tapi lifestyle dia orang gerek pe
like more than a hundred thousand subs lah not not that I do or I care lah but macam sekarang
talking to them talking to them very talking about them very poorly lah macam
kau ambil kesempatan kan untuk bual
untuk bual dengan mengumpat orang mengumpat pasal orang then
kau mengumpat mengumpat mengumpat then
you know that you you didn't prepare contingency plan lah furthermore also macam everybody
tapi kau kau pandai kau pandai sangat kan
this kind of content eh the macam
gossipping eh to me right is macam is very normal you know guys gossip
we're keeping it to ourselves whereas macam dee kosh eh he
macam I I actually I I more or less kind of hate most of the
now sekarang
err macam like still remember err the what's her what the fuck's her what the fuck's her name err
ah nicole choo with the ridhwan azman kan macam
actually if you when I think about it again eh when I when I really really think about it again ah macam actually the nicole choo right is not doing anything wrong you know
nicole nicole choo right nicole choo dengan ridhwan eh memang they memang dia orang buat
habis macam they have the drama and then people are not supposed to know about this drama you know but they
then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu

I don't know how to explain ah I thought it's actually macam merepek at the start
tengok aje and then I finish I finish err three seasons or something but the one of the seasons macam
the character macam menyampah and I cannot stand her and I always want to sepak her so I just skip the whole a bit first season
oh I understand I faham
I agree but sometimes I don't even tengok like the anime but I dengar the music is like wow
mm you know my adik like
she ask me to beli a poster with haikyuu on it
and then she's like eh kakak asal like
don't have semua all all the characters all the teams then I'm like huh mana kakak tahu like I
then I legit spend like satu jam searching for the
err then she ask me to print this gambar
of like the haikyuu teams and it's like an infographic then she ask me to print the infographic as a poster then like huh you want me to print infographic like legit the infographic is like um with all the percentage semua
oh is it macam like dia type like X D semua
huh legit sekarang pun ada
oh my god sekali he very old he still type like that
betul but like you cannot lari from it anyway so it's like you deal with it
bertitik tolak okay let's see
the soalan macam tak fun
hmm duit
if duit is percuma then tak payah beli apa-apa
percuma is for you only
ya cause tinggi what
wait isn't like macam the the the kasut
you know my I cannot find my size at like the kedai
it's quite sad ya then selalu I will buy like oh uh
like selalu the size will will only like naik until forty
ke apa then my size is like forty one kalau if you follow the rubi size
then I'm like aww but all the kasut is like cantik and then I cannot like muat then I'm like huh
mm oh my god last time I was searching for a pair of kasut for like my work
the other time like last year or something and then I actually uh duduk at the rubi for like
satu jam and then I was opening and hooking and unhooking the kasut from the shelf and then the shop owner look at me like huh you want to buy or not
then I legit do that for so long and then I end up tak beli apa-apa then I just left the store
ya I think they look at me like I was about to curi the kasut or something
and then I diri there and I was going to check in lah then my phone semua then I was scanning the safe entry then my safe entry macam lagging so
I tunggu there for like three minutes or something because my internet macam
tak bagus and then you know the ilahui person keep going up to me then they keep saying oh welcome welcome for like two minutes straight then I'm like huh what like
one welcome cukup already don't need to say welcome for so many times then I legit like menyampah you know I don't even want to go inside the shop after they welcome me for like two minutes
it's legit the only like the the dua worker in the store and like everyone who works in the store basically just like went up to me to say welcome
so like menyampah eh I'm so paiseh and annoyed at the same time
oh that's teruk
oh what did you beli during eleven eleven did you buy anything
oh you pindah
but isn't everything like macam dekat anyway
see I don't know what I beli during eleven eleven actually I want to beli baju also but I'm like
I beli baju then end up
tak keluar rumah so
the lampu cause I told you my room is very sad
and I legit beli like the lampu like lampu lap lip punya kind you know and it's the long lampu with the like the curtain type of lampu
a bit lah it's a bit you know sometimes the lampu raya is like long and then got like the dangly like like like hujan like that ya I bought lampu like that so I want hang it across my whole wall
alamak that's a bit jauh

online punya volunteer maybe ada lagi but I don't know where to find
I feel like I have to do something useful all the like like buang masa only stay like at home
mm like just now mm I sleep like lapan jam like yesterday night and I still was so penat this afternoon you know I kept sleeping even I don't know why maybe it's because I panas sangat or something

it's so fun but you go there macam nak beli furniture tapi tak like just
alamak that's so kesian
you never ikut us go ice skating right
actually I heard the the skating with the roda the round roda is harder than the rollerblade
cause roller skate the the roda is like like dua dua dua dua but then the rollerblade is only satu like one row then apparently the rollerblade is easier to skate in
why so menakutkan
it's okay if like satu orang jatuh then everyone will jatuh cause we all hold hands
eh so fast november is going to habis already
wah the only productive thing I did is like kemaskan bilik
like I I've been saying to myself like oh I'll kemas bilik I'll kemas bilik for like like one minggu already and then finally I did it now I feel like I got nothing else to do

actually kalau
beli satu then you get another one for free is a bit quite a nice deal
maybe what if you like uh you want to okay let's say you don't beli if you do something and then you get one free like uh you marry one wife and then you get another one for free
eh that's like uh you get a kembar
oh my god what if the what if the couple macam
suddenly keluar kembar and then what are they going to do if they already prepare for only one child and then the other budak eh
the doctor also don't tell them that they ada twins and then sekali ada keluar dua

I think I think got some wedding then they will stay there then oh I think the nenek
the nenek also was there the nenek lives there or something like that
mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
macam maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya dah how many
know like macam
ya ya see kalau ada kemampuan lah I mean like ah ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
like macam
uh so that's why like macam
and plus like macam it depend how you
investment eh apa tu namanya um
like macam like you will get money if you
like insurance like that tapi you will get monthly money ah
no macam every month you pay something then after that you will receive um
ya tak
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like macam a clean way of saving money or like getting investment kan
masing-masing ah eh masing-masing
kalau tak okay ah
so kita masih kat sini

kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh

oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet
cause kau ninety nine
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety
so it's like what twenty four gitu and he's one of the oldest
aku rasa kau kau masuk nanti kau tua sia kau masuk next year kan
eh kau graduate is what month
april oh that means kau aku punya intake ah
should be masuk may atau june aku june intake what
girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer
then dah tu apa
aku patah balik bunk kau tahu kita kena
apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like

kau nak jerit kat orang buat apa eh
ya but why jerit during when can jerit everyday and not be in that also
dorang tu um scout me for
apa tu saint john
tak nak medical kan

cause it's the biggest uh macam parade kan
cause I remember D&T block like really kecil and then in between the classes
no the centre one banyak pokok the the gardening the science block one is slightly bigger the space
situ jer korang merayau kat sana
but ya I I mean is the foot drill kan macam side side foot drill nya competition macam korang buat foot drill cause of footwork so korang buat the or whatever shit it is called is for precision
ee ada what what uniformed group ada eh
I know primary school ada scout
oh join kat luar
buang masa jer
east side tak ada eh
west coast ada cause that time I remember ada this budak book in
kau masih budak how can you
eighteen and I hold like like corporal how are you lieutenant then I realised aku zoom kan it's not civil defence
it's and then they go around macam
I think macam tu ah hannah nya ex siapa tu nama nya
siapa nama dia khai eh
ya and then dia dia nya mum
text hannah cakap like takmo jumpa anak dia selalu
tak cukup ke jumpa kat sekolah kau imagine kalau mak dia dah cakap gitu dekat faiz faiz would
kan terus ten K pun buang
merlin merlin semua camelot semua ada
wait but the one yang faiz bilang kan is the same night yang kita keluar
um cause when faiz bilang kan
oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
in school relax sikit lah ah cikgu tak minta banyak
oh ya ke
so basically in school hari ini kita start sekolah pukul um nine

it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than duit then err
ya I will boleh jimat banyak sangat ah
clothes boleh like kadangkala jer boleh splurge
for me it's err mengada-ngada
err ya other people like example macam service crews cikgu
that one itu tak boleh tahan ah
kalau dia orang betul-betul like
tak tahu like boundaries like as sebagai
spam jer lah nanti besok pagi dia tengok all of your messages
boyfriend kita semua kat army
like semua benda like the system capitalism semua sudah tak ada
then you will bring about chaos lah sebab semua orang akan like fikir
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example macam food semua food resources
tak ada system ya
so some would tamak kan
so dapat uh apa tu will definitely
dia orang will definitely be selfish lah of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually macam create havoc
so as much as capitalism semua orang cakap macam tak bagus it's like much needed in the

rank apa lagi eh
actually apa lagi eh nak cakap
so kirakan kau just take advantage of this the rank lah ini
suka eh mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang jer dapat increase kau punya wing rate and everything err
okay lah I mean ada orang main memang macam gitu so
then like dia macam dragon gitu super cool
dia punya actually I've tried before lah and
aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia
legit legit super thick like macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia
and dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya ulti kan dia tak hit minion
dia dia tau pandai nak hit so macam I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
actually tank right I think kau pakai hilda atau masha is good lah I mean ya we've talked about it hilda atau masha
aku kalau aku kalau fighter atau tank tak boleh
cause like aku tak I'm not the kind to step up lah aku aku tiada pendirian lah sia
paksa kan nampak
so why buy new one you know like asal kan kau satisfied you know you know
ya eh but you know bila hilda
wait you do know macam zoom kan bila dia speed up kan seram seh itu
aku aku nak initiate aku macam kalau aku versus hilda
abeh dia tiba-tiba speed belakang aku aku in the end aku macam anxious aku macam eh
aku macam anxious
sebab macam seram sia kau imagine benda besar
abeh lari dekat kau and macam tiba-tiba tengah relax relax dengan minion tiba-tiba dekat bush keluar benda besar tengah nak attack kau
lucky sesat
support oh and my angela or my mage ah my mage she also actually aku pun main ganas-ganas
so like we can tag senang
or like bila kau pakai hilda aku boleh pakai vexana
they also itu tau they also ban uranus
wait I don't they always suruh
they always macam suggest to ban uranus
kau kau practise kau punya hilda kan kasi work out kasi dia buff buff kan macam macam wow
then you beli draft pick ambil kau
pasal aku baca kan aku tak tahu sangat kan so macam uh aku just tekan dengan smash button macam dengan kau punya freya
so macam it's quite fun
okay lah but yang kau aku tak tahu sangat itu hero ah so I have no say lah but it's fun lah it's just fun to play him
like walaupun dia macam gitu kan tapi macam
susah bunuh dia lah basically uranus and then they also ban aldous aldous aldous ya and they also ban helcurt
I mean from my recent experience ah chey recent experience but really lah macam that time recently I play
abeh dia orang ban ah dia orang ban helcurt dia orang ban
dia orang ban uranus dia orang ban aldous
then they also ban siapa eh
kau tahu ling
then they also ban siapa eh
lunch ah cause I'm thinking if I should take half day leave atau sorry okay girl gotta earn some money
eh ini okay I'm totally gonna like
tukar kerja chey just kidding
weak such a weakling then cakap jer banyak tapi action tak ada action ada so tidak apa lah kita just layan kan kita just okay okay nak gym eh okay
tengok ah dia nanti dia macam eh sorry ah
penat ah eh sorry lah
ngantuk ah
kau sengaja eh but okay okay maybe okay lah I just take the whole day leave lah
ada dekat-dekat ada andes lah ada kan
so should be fine lah and nasi-nasi itu semua where got time for nasi we go western
wait no just kidding I need my nasi I am
I need my nasi
okay tak sangat lah
kita tak cakap pasal staycay seh kita just cakap pasal
ah penat
apa seh but
eh no okay actually we meet we've been planning to meet so many times but selalu it's either macam dia penat satu penat satu malas atau just macam
wrong timing lah everytime aku ajak
so macam okay lor
but we are fine with hanging out together lah kau step jer mana kau punya glue glue alamak kita boleh hang out sendiri lah chey just kidding
so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
adalah kaedah get in the workers are you get everyday
kuih suji is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause uh it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like berat it's just so heavy and
like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
boleh beli kalau you nak boleh beli yang
entah apa brand lah but I can recommend you few brands
tapi bulan december ini awak cuti kan
abeh are you going back
if you go exchange programme itu dia ambil masa berapa lama one year
audit uh start working oh because dia belum
so dia ada
uh is does dia ada plan untuk balik singapore ke tak
kau nak pergi ke tak
no lah go but you can try like kalau kalau kau suka
like you see the course kalau kau suka
ada lah yang itu yang dulu itu
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga
as long as I dapat feature wall yang ada frame

but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one
but you are initially macam kau okay with that ah actually
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard
macam eh eh eh bodoh you know that kind of thing
kau jangan get rile up ah
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
oh it's one of those kind I like like like um on the video kadang-kadang
they would ah play macam
okay so dia cakap macam
kalau aku hilmi
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira kan macam
ravenous nak mampus
so macam um I think they were doing like is
macam no no no
aku dah macam yo
is it dah macam you know like
no it's not so much muz ah muz macam
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati ah you know that kind of thing
ah kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention
so I kau jangan cakap gini ah
macam you cannot expect a marriage now what doesn't make sense right
just the show juga
oh he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
oh no no aku have
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
this makes sense aku aku faham
australia eh tak
and we been friends for berapa tahun
dari twenty fifteen
tu twenty fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
did you know they say kalau apa ni you been friends for tujuh tahun lebih kan then it's a friend for life so in this one year that's the defining
and that's like nanti we we buat apa ni
macam buat form konon eh aku kasi kau ah nadi you have to sign this form for making sure friends for life
so lagi satu tahun ah
banyak commitment
okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah
ah hujan ah
a'ah hujan ah
cable car dari bawah naik
oh as opposed to dua hari
it's either they brought the stones up atau dorang carve dari mountain
uh huh uh huh selalunya dorang carve kan dari mountain
oh I thought I thought macam dorang tak tahan lepas tu tolong terlalu banyak tension cabut
sana memang orang punya license pun
okay okay I mean aku faham dia tinggal kat negara singapura dah lama juga you know what I mean
huh suara lain sikit
tak payah nak try
so sabar so dia that means dia stop ah terus dia cabut as in
or memang plan dia memang until that time aje
kalau kita kita nak kena fikir lama-lama nak kena hmm
and then eventually we masih bodoh cakap jom boleh
okay kau cakap tak worth it aku ikut
oh dia macam okay ah tak payah nak ikut lama-lama ah
malaysia banyak tempat apa kau nak gi terengganu boleh langkawi
aku baru nak I was about to say ubin then I'm like what the heck is wrong with me
baik I think kalau indonesia jangan dulu ah
pasal dorang belum lagi control dorang punya
err problem sikit tapi boleh juga
embassy malaysia eh indonesia pun tak kasi masuk pe
aku nya plan nak kena cari kerja lah
okay dah dah satu jam okay continue another day
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan
ada ambil ah
eh but then when I was at the clinic ini kan it's so awkward
because semua orang datang dengan dorang punya partner I went there alone
tak tahu apa nak buat kesian like husband pandai buat you know that kind of thing
bila nak penetrate semua nak ya bodohnya jantan
ya depan belakang tak boleh okay pusat pun boleh
ya air air I also quite a number of people lah you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
like I pretend macam dengar music daripada hal
tak nampak pregnant ah tapi dia macam nangis lah but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely
pakai tu lah saran wrap
ya because err err kadang-kadang you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
most of the time aku akan pakai
oh ya that's why oh so actually mak aku cakap kan um vanilla extract have gelatin
but kan um mak aku cakap if you want find like vanilla extract atau vanilla essence
kau nak kena make sure dia tak ada gelatin cause most of their product have like gelatin inside
ya that time kau cakap kau nak bakekan aku brownies
so kau sudah bakekan haikal
but we're fine we no we just fight macam sekejap jer lah you know like ten minutes kind
no lah because most of them like I'm cranky but then my cranky is like main-main jer
but yesterday I saw you post about him then kau delete
why apasal kau delete
wait so dah dia ada motor
oh tapi dia rarely pakai motor
um takut tapi lama-lama macam sudah biasa
err spark eh eh sorry aku tak ingat ah dia punya motor semua
no it's either spark atau sniper
mana picnic
um okay maybe not friday since friday hari raya haji kan
okay kejap bila ah okay mostly
next week aku sekolah lah
this week aku tak sekolah next week aku sekolah
but aku tak akan sekolah on the thursday and friday sebab hari raya
ya next week oh eh alamak aku sekolah lah ya allah
okay hopefully nenek aku tak datang sebab she's coming today I think
aku takut she will stay until hari raya
then kau tahu ah kalau ada nenek aku kan macam a bit
eh can we try like um picnic dekat bonnet
they like decorate the place they put like tikar all
then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia
eh kau tahu aku tak dapat seh yang that kids club punya
merepek seh
what if what if all of aku punya

most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik

like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau

so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam

habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um

then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan

yang biasa-biasa jer lah
err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him

ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu

so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah
last time they really gold the adat lah
various lah silat taekwando
as long as you belah after two weeks ah I don't mind
like being straightforward it's like just say lah like oh apa I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
like uh aku akan ambil macam angkat ah baju-baju kotor ni but some people see it as rude macam orh
uh so macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini ah aku kena buat semua benda ah kat rumah ni
ya the melayu so formal I cannot
ah no we only speak it when ada oral ke
with abang
biasanya with abang or ibu a bit lah macam gini lah like transition between english and malay but for hilah hundred percent english
ah I also don't know eh but um one of my friends like dia sekarang dalam uni and he is a
he major in journalist bahasa melayu lah so
language ya macam ada perkataan like tak pernah dengar and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so macam I feel like
bahasa melayu ni is not for today lah
orang dulu-dulu because orang dulu
macam bahasa baku kan
along the way people macam get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of dekat kau kena
lima minit short tak apa lah

kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah

I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so
aria aria the rambut macam besar gila kan

dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama sia
tapi tak dapat ah
since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot ah
then uh aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah
tak nak ah
tengok kerusi all
uh and streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah Secret Lab one
asal mahal sangat sia it's just a chair right
tak ah tapi tapi even though
it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai Coke
untuk cuci toilet
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks ah like even time hari raya kan
uh okay usually guest just eh uh tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang kan
my my nenek punya side more of Coke ah so they got like
then another container is all just uh apa ni F&N
ya hari raya
so if I go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea gitu
apa eh the other one yang ah the hijau one the hijau one sedap ah
tak tapi the best one I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour one
but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know
macam repeat
then macam
tak ah tapi sekarang not that bad because like
but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
yang sebelah yang sebelah Hard Rock Cafe
ya cause uh my friend from dulu kerja
uh like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu ah wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
but dorang punya is more for ini kan is like
like apa ni concerts semua kan
kat Shangri-La that that type
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang ah
kerja senang ah tak yah buat banyak sangat ah
oh ya but Marche tak halal lah
eh jangan gini ah
berbual really like proper english punya you know and like
a bit more to the mahal side ah
then dia dapat banyak apa ni
uh banyak freebies semua
but then dia kira balik kan actually what he paid for
but I heard the cakes there good ah the the kuih lapis cake ah
should try ah should try go there makan
can ajak C what
eh eh you tell her first ah eh I'm not gonna pay for you mm bayar sendiri
muka sedih ugh
I I I think nanti aku re-watch ah
I think it's like a company just uh macam get all these people kan
then dorang buat macam a short video macam as a skit
kau imagine macam
macam key and peele
okay ah tapi no matter how many times I re-watch eh
kekek gila ah I will still laugh and laugh and laugh ah
like semalam semalam adik aku main the
key and peele yang mana eh
what apa what's name eh
asal achap tak leh
I thought and him best friend already just now talk on Discord macam
macam brother eh
nanti nanti nanti there he he sniff all our cigarettes sia
tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
uh huh tak kan ah dorang jual
then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
okay ya so macam to start the conversation I aku introduce aku myself first ah

ya but I heard kau kau learn a lot during kau punya
ya lah I mean daripada kau tak ada kerja then um kau just want to get a
kau went over and ask for apa yang tu err
apa yang kau pergi minta err bidan then dia orang bilang engkau suruh ambil err hairdressing kan
to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards
I see all good brother pasal ya ya lah I mean budak budak kecil right they
ya I I think kau punya anak quite err pintar eh
macam quite intelligent eh
macam ya lah kecil habis err
degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
where everyone was really macam
kerja atau tak kerja lah
ah but now is macam
or the environment macam play err err
make them to kind of macam stop from
oh itu lah itu lah um
aku pun macam kira macam wow after all these years err
I I was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
ah you know macam err you know talking about
music in general macam macam err the whole world right now is err having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is um
habis aku was just err bagi tahu
err deedee the other day a friend of kau tahu deedee lah kan
so aku bagi tahu deedee about macam you know the rest of the world
um especially macam dekat and what not
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what I mean it's like macam um
macam ya lah
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
ya I mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
you can have time untuk
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
uh all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and you know right now everyone was really macam
mm really macam
ya lah tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
crazy times juga
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
ya semua orang macam
anyhow ah kira macam sembarang ah kira uh it's ya
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big err
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know err
aku I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it ah you know macam
because like ya macam
is is like apa
somebody dekat dalam kat india
I mean iphone punya itu okay lah no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money ah you know unless dia orang macam like ah okay ah kita skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like

in other formation gegenpress ah so tak boleh just sembarangan ah ni
the what what clubs other than the english premier league tak ada logo
so so apa uh what what what club are you planning to manage
on aku main is that time time poly is sixteen

so and that one is used to for my adik punya apa tu school
which Zoom pun boleh lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom dah lag
running the whole thing nak type password dah you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear ah then
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother pakai you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
nanti eh so
the whole day ah nanti kau ah kau keluar

takde tak I I I've seen the
english punya league
cam the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
ye from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below ada below what the heck I think I think it's
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine kalau you know
singapore ada
S league delta league don't know what actually kita ada lah that is why the government decide to dissolve
I mean ya lah I mean that macam adik aku every
every night ah dia ah he come back from his camp army camp nanti around
maybe six plus dia makan by seven he will be out
dengan member member dia uh kat bawah block
then main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us lah whether he he play in league ke he play in what nonsense ah cause
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore ah abeh takkan takkan seh eh
nak main bola like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
whatever it is ah but there's a lot of african kid who's buncit so I can relate
year one eh kena okay anyway ah
seven years that's lama pe aku poly
bankrupt aku wait wait wait
tahun empat tahun pastu ah enam enam years ah I haven't been playing football actually lama pe
