okay hi #azli# yes and we both of us are (um) married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
(uh) twenty nine but I <malay>tak terjun botol punya orang</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't know because that time I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>terjun botol</malay> when you actually (uh) proposed to me right I <malay>rasa macam</malay> like the happiest girl on earth [lor] then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam semak</malay> because the thing is that (um) it's not very often for me to get (um)
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like <malay>macam</malay> those people who idiots people [lah] but then (uh)
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say [oh] automatically I said yes [one] so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like [ah] because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
(uh) condo credit card car and whatever the C [lah] but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like (um) like what you want to do when we get married
will be like [oh] no this one [lah]
he cannot I already [mah] so you say that you end up
so when that time when (um) it was my turn right (um) I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like (um) does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually (um) proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up [ah] that time we were already like twenty seven I think
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old !wah! <malay>sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi</malay> [ha] ya so
I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I think this the right time for us to get married
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like (uh) knows (um) a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
[ha] decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah]
because of the and the right that one all (um) we we prepare ourselves yes (uh) I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
(uh) we all all our by ourself [lah]
but remember that time we <malay>kena kena tipu</malay>
the for our <malay>kad jemputan</malay>
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like (um) they say it in (um)
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them [ah] then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think (uh) we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars [eh] I was about to fork out everything [eh] to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't [eh] I was actually thanks to
to your mother also [lah] from actually stopped me also <malay>mak mak</malay> stopped me
ya because I trust them so much
but then (uh) at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because (uh) it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give [lah] but that time
[ah] ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways (uh) it actually works I print exactly [lah] that's why [ah] you got extra correct so that time
so (uh) eventually after that we that's not the only problem [ah] during our wedding [ah] actually my greatest fear for (uh)
I actually [oh] the next one the problem was (uh) the <malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>tak nak nyanyi</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak</malay> show up we got the best [tau] he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
quite popular in #suria# also and (uh) he's one of the funniest guy [ah] I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out !alah!
ya wasted [sia] it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like !walao! not on my wedding [lah] [sia]
!huh! ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer [lah] then that caterer also say (um) I don't know [lah] he's like that [lah] the <malay>perangai macam apa</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I was like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>merepek</malay> [seh] <malay>perangai</malay>
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude <malay>macam</malay> #siak# so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) eventually I
call I I try to find <malay>kat</malay> facebook <malay>tengok ada tak siapa-siapa</malay> so I found
but before our wedding there was this (uh) issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free [lah] contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better [eh] best [eh] until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also (uh) still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel [lah] so shout out to #azuri# and then (um)
ya our our wedding take place #azuri# #azur# but (uh) the his name is #azuri#
okay
so ya okay so
then that [kan] so all the <malay>lagu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>ada lagu melayu semua</malay> all <malay>mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus</malay> (uh) <malay>baju semua</malay> awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
the whatever [kan] <malay>semua tak</malay> show up <malay>tak apa tapi</malay> caterer <malay>kalau tak</malay> show up !wah!
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that <malay>makanan apa</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa</malay> maggi <malay>mee</malay>
ya
is very much (um)
ya <malay>macam</malay> [lah]
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy (err) better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya I mean (um) he he <malay>dia</malay> very professional [lah] professional <malay>dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu</malay> and <malay>dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun</malay> for [ah] because the reason is that my mum is under religious <malay>punya</malay> school studies so <malay>kalau</malay>
so <malay>kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti</malay> my mum was like [eh] don't open like all these kind of song [ah]
[ha] so <malay>macam</malay> he understand like throughout truly [lah] everything <malay>semua dia faham semua</malay> so the was good
(uh) eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer <malay>datang</malay> we got our photoshoot photographs <malay>semua</malay>
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes <malay>kita punya</malay> video <malay>tak dapat balik</malay> so orang lain (um) <malay>tunjukkan</malay> video <malay>kat</malay> facebook after like what
two weeks <malay>kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan</malay> video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
ya
yes correct then the things that <malay>bila</malay> I that's when I found out that <malay>macam</malay>
(um) actually I don't really care [lah] that's it's correct [lah] <malay>macam sedih kita tak dapat</malay> video <malay>tapi</malay> at that same time I say
video could be just a story then <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>nak cerita</malay> I <malay>dengan</malay> you like forever <malay>punya cerita</malay> video so I say okay
I want to get my own video <malay>tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat</malay> because my computer very slow
ya I know <malay>banyak tapi</malay> video (um) computer slow the things that all <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> the computer <malay>baru datang baru boleh buat</malay>
okay so ya make it a drive all right so (um) is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage [ah] the wedding [ah]
[oh] ya the weather it was nice [ah]
(mm)
<malay>cuaca</malay>
ya the <malay>cuaca</malay> was nice because <malay>dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun</malay> so it was just that perfect moment
ya
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding (um) because that wedding [kan] (um) I like my wedding <malay>betul</malay> but
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom <malay>punya</malay> wedding right is like <malay>terbaik</malay> [ah] <malay>pada</malay> I (um) shout to #shah ibrahim# he make it like <malay>macam</malay> it's like a hotel
<malay>tapi</malay> still <malay>macam tak</malay> hotel <malay>juga</malay> parking is the perfect place to park the car because <malay>apa ni kat mana</malay> [eh]
[kan] #tanjong katong# complex yes so that place was <malay>macam</malay> #tanjong katong# complex where <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) what is called ya (mm) ya <malay>dia punya</malay> parking is open space it's there's lot of parking <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> parking <malay>pun</malay> you can still park at #wisma# you can still park at
#hooga# [eh] <malay>salah</malay> group <malay>punya</malay> side <malay>banyak tempat untuk</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> and then when I ask my friend because (um) I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there <malay>semua cakap makan</malay> and everything is just cost like less [eh]
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like <malay>macam</malay> that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like <malay>macam</malay> if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> one thing about bad about that place it's not bad [lah] I say <malay>macam</malay>
not that fantastic about that place is just that <malay>dia punya tempat nak tukar baju</malay> and everything (mm)
[ah] yes because the things that <malay>macam</malay> okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as <malay>apa kita tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali</malay>
[eh]
ya around two to three right (uh) some ours was three ya ours was three [eh] no the <malay>sanding</malay> was two and then the <malay>nikah</malay> was one but <malay>nikah</malay> was a day before
so <malay>macam kita kita macam</malay> !wah! get married and then [ah] one thing about ya that one is just that [ah]
and then <malay>dapat</malay> hotel <malay>semua</malay> my friend actually (uh) because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> because wedding malay weddings like <malay>kelam-kabut nak mampus</malay> [leh] <malay>bukan bukan</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you [dah] you <malay>nak tukar baju</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding</malay>
<malay>sekali macam</malay> you <malay>nak kena naik kereta</malay> go to the hotel just to <malay>tukar baju</malay> and then go back there so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] traffic and then <malay>campur</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay> make up <malay>semua</malay> and then <malay>nak kena pakai baju semua</malay> so eventually that one [ah] take process up to two to three hours [eh]
the hours [eh] maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to !alah! <malay>dah cukup datang</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak juga pasal kalau nak buat</malay> photoshoot <malay>tak ada</malay> time <malay>mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>semua orang nak ambil gambar</malay> that time semua [ha] <malay>selit sikit</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> that's the only <malay>macam</malay> if for orange ballroom [ah] but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary <malay>kita buat</malay> wedding <malay>lagi</malay>
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum <malay>punya dia akan suka</malay> okay about malay wedding [eh]
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or <malay>terpaksa</malay> like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like [eh] you got child <malay>ni</malay> you got child some more [ah]
!walao! I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] <malay>makcik ni</malay>
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually <malay>dia orang cuma ingat yang</malay> my mum <malay>cuma ada</malay> my brother and sister my <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
cause my brother my <malay>kakak</malay> is the only people who are like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>terserlah</malay> I me and my <malay>adik kita orang macam</malay> relax [ah] <malay>kita orang</malay> relax chill <malay>lepak</malay> bro <malay>tak buat apa-apa semua kita</malay> relax <malay>tak macam</malay>
my sister and my brother [ha] <malay>kita memang</malay> low profile relax [ah] relax like like you <malay>juga</malay> [kan] you <malay>pun</malay> relax <malay>tak buat apa-apa juga macam</malay>
ya
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> that time (uh)
we did say to (uh) my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there <malay>kalau</malay> I was there <malay>macam</malay> over
[ah]
so confirm I <malay>dah gaduh dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dah tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> K what if K <malay>takpe</malay> next question (uh) just asking you what is the luckiest or like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
(um) thank god that time one one thing is the <malay>cuaca</malay> [kan] <malay>cuaca cuaca</malay> was like perfect [ah] okay then another thing <malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>suka pasal</malay> that wedding
(mm)
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing [ah] for you [ah] for me the luckiest will be the photo [ah] no no not the photography the photography was good [ah] the no ya
the other guy I mean my friend <malay>punya</malay>
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing [ah] that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
I feel like <malay>macam</malay> that is the most the best thing [ah] of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about <malay>tak boleh makan</malay> or can <malay>makan</malay> also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know [ah] maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually [ah] <malay>menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak</malay> [ha] <malay>dah kahwin pun</malay> [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau tak</malay> then I I I I still okay so <malay>takpe</malay> okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of (um) crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
<malay>lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya cara</malay> you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my <malay>makcik cakap</malay> auntie lisa [lah] she told me that
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
<malay>orang ketiga ke apa</malay> #alhamdulillah# I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no <malay>orang ketiga</malay>
[kan] ya so just to ask you again but (um)
we go through like a lot of stuff [lah] eventually until now even though it's
it's almost six years already (um) we are not (uh) blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with (uh) being with you [lah] okay so (um) <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak tanya</malay> you what was on your mind
okay (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kahwin</malay> okay once you <malay>dah habis</malay>
all the <malay>nikah</malay> right and then (um) all the <malay>sanding semua dah habis</malay> [kan] and then outside then (um) <malay>kat dalam bilik</malay> <malay>dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur</malay> [kan]
but what was on your mind [eh] <malay>dalam otak</malay> you <malay>tu apa</malay> you <malay>fikir macam</malay> it was for me like I <malay>fikir macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku dah kahwin</malay> [lah] [seh]
<malay>aku dah aku dah</malay> I'm like all these responsibilities <malay>macam</malay> !fuh! [dah] jatuh kat kat</malay> I [lah] then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> [eh] I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] like like really I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] I <malay>tak sangka</malay> I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> and then [ah] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>takpe</malay> #lek# even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> [oh] wait wait wait <malay>kau dah kahwin</malay>
okay so that was like (uh) that but it wasn't a big thing yet [ah] [ah] but for you what what's on your mind <malay>bila</malay>
you <malay>bila</malay> all this <malay>dah habis</malay> [kan] and the <malay>sanding</malay> part <malay>semua dah habis</malay> what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya
ya then like because the thing is that (uh) okay regarding about the call right <malay>dia macam mana</malay> [tau]
because the thing is that <malay>kalau</malay> you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home <malay>ke tak</malay>
[ah] not because (um) <malay>curang ke apa</malay> [lah] [ha] but it's more to like <malay>macam</malay> (um) like you <malay>pukul berapa nak balik</malay> I mean like worried [tau] worried (uh) you you also did because the thing is that
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dah jadi isteri</malay>
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
where are you <malay>tu semua</malay> and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like <malay>macam kalau malam</malay> alone not that good [lah] [kan] cause it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good [lah] thank god we've got a good neighbourhood [ah] but no people like any tom dick or harry <malay>ke apa ke</malay> you call <malay>dia orang nak</malay> strike strike <malay>malam apa betul tak</malay>
[ha] so I <malay>tak suka</malay> [lah] [kan]
then (um) so another thing is like respect [lah] also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you [ah] <malay>bila</malay> [eh] you <malay>ni bila nak balik ni semua</malay> then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya <malay>tapi</malay> there's the I mean mostly you like about that [lah] [ah] but one thing about him like you <malay>tak kasih</malay> I you <malay>kasih</malay> I <malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>kebebasan</malay> also so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> happy [lah] [ha] so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind [lah] like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out [lah] yang <malay>kita ni ada banyak kesamaan</malay> in terms of like movies
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
ya and then like <malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) marvels (uh)
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like <malay>macam</malay> harry potter you don't like <malay>tapi</malay> (um) lord of the ring you like and then
(um) some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
(err) so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] give and take [ah] stuff like that (uh) then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
is travelling [kan]
<malay>tak sama serupa</malay>
(mm)
ya
!chey! that was a punishment though
[eh]
<malay>jap</malay> at that time you <malay>belum apa</malay> at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
I don't know [eh] [oh] I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me [ah] I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry [ah] because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
meticulous [lah] <malay>macam semua benda</malay> I <malay>mesti macam</malay> make sure that everything [eh] <malay>mesti macam</malay>
goes well [lah] (uh) because I <malay>punya orang tak macam itu</malay> [tau] I <malay>punya orang tak macam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak jadi pergi sini</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] due to this and that and this and that I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>rasa risau</malay> [ha] but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day [eh] <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] on that time we actually had fun [eh] [ha] better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu <malay>macam tak</malay> plan <malay>apa</malay> and <malay>lepas tu kita terus</malay> like (uh) okay just dive [ah]
<malay>kita pergi</malay> cameron and port dickson
<malay>duit ada</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> okay I <malay>terjun</malay> [jer] [ah] [ha] so it was <malay>macam</malay> it was fun [lah] it was fun <malay>kita pergi</malay> honeymoon <malay>tu semua</malay> and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then (uh) travel then
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also [lah]
(uh) then he he can drive well [ha] <malay>naik atas semua</malay> and then because that one also is my first time I went out to (um) holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone <malay>ke pergi dengan kawan ke</malay> or <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>apa tak pernah</malay> my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>orang lain dah siapkan dah</malay>
no [lah] but then but
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] [ah] but one thing is just like it's just fun [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's it's one thing like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! [dah] [dah] start into responsibility end up okay <malay>dah tahu macam mana nak</malay> book hotel <malay>tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis</malay> stop <malay>tak</malay> <malay>asyik</malay> book hotel [jer] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday [jer]
ya
actually <malay>ada banyak juga</malay> for #bandung# but <malay>ada tapi kita tak tak</malay> venture <malay>ke sana</malay> [lah]
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then (um) like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
I regret <malay>tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin</malay> but then again I <malay>rasa</malay> this is still the right time because the thing is that
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that (um) we wanted to do [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam kita tak boleh buat macam</malay> (uh) and then (um) but then again after I <malay>dah berapa tahun yang</malay> I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people <malay>punya</malay> kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the time I I
I <malay>macam suka ikut-ikut orang</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ni ada</malay> bag dior I <malay>pun nak</malay> bag [ah] <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak pun nak</malay> I I <malay>pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat</malay> cafe <malay>ni semua</malay> but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding [lah] our wedding supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that <malay>dia orang suka</malay> (um)
they do their own way marriage [lah]
[ah] so that's why [lah]
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so (um)
can I just ask you another question [ah] before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me [lah]
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and !hey! you <malay>jangan cakap</malay> you <malay>pun tak ada</malay> flaws <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] [ha] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example [kan] <malay>macam kalau dulu</malay> you <malay>tahu kalau</malay> before <malay>kahwin</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kalau tak kalau</malay> you <malay>kahwin</malay> you can play endless car <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but (um)
after marriage maybe you find like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena layan dia ni</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana</malay> I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets [ah]
(mm)
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding [oh] <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [ha] <malay>macam</malay> for me [kan] I <malay>tak</malay> regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but (uh) <malay>macam</malay> being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married [ah] [ah] but one thing about you you don't you don't let <malay>macam</malay> [ah] give me to <malay>kongkong</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that [kan] [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> I freedom of what to do like for example even this (uh) recording screen <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
some people will find it <malay>macam</malay> the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give [ha] so <malay>macam</malay> it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really <malay>macam</malay> into it [lah]
[ha] <malay>cakap nanti berselerak</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah</malay> [lah] [kan] so so eventually <malay>macam</malay> not all guys can actually accept this [ah] so actually one thing I I happy [lah] I <malay>dapat kahwin dengan</malay> you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it <malay>macam</malay> funny [ah] because that time I wasn't planning [mah] to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking [eh] this guy okay or not [ha]
eventually he is like one okay guy [lah] so okay [lor] okay last question
last question [lah] I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me [ah]
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding [ah] marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
I I <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau</malay> you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity (uh) I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault [ah] it's your fault but then (um) there's no such thing as #tercheat# [ah]
#ter# #ter# there's no such thing as that one for for what I know [lah]
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me [lah]
[ha] if you do have another girl outside or what then (um) that was one of my biggest fear [lah] I have I don't have like small small fear but then <malay>macam</malay> that one I think that if that happen <malay>terus</malay> cut [ah]
[ah] and also <malay>pukul</malay> [lah] but then I there wasn't any hit or anything [ah] I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything [lah] (uh) so (um) okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
(uh) like for example anything [ah] that you think like <malay>ada ke apa</malay> biggest fear [lah]
ya correct [ah] then about (uh) then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people [ah] that one
(uh) never give me stress also because like the thing is that (um) in-laws right
some in-laws [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me <malay>macam</malay> I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum <malay>ke apa</malay> and then your mum don't like me <malay>akan cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [sia] [eh] sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [ha] [dah] [lah] <malay>gemuk tak lawa tu semua</malay> but then it's like
not like that [ah] your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually (um) (uh) <malay>apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua</malay> so we were like
okay [lah] still got we we there was a bond there [ha] and now (uh) we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then

okay so (um) I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually (uh) know
about you more [lah]
