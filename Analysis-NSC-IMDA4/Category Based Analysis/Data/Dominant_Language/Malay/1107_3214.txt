at such a young age I was thinking like I was nineteen years old [eh] how old are twenty one I was doing what [oh] I was in
[eh] actually no [lah] twenty one I was already doing theatre I already acting
I started at nineteen [what]
ya so <malay>lepas apa tu</malay>

I asked around [lah] I said how to go for audition right <malay>untuk apa ni</malay> how to start theatre how to do theatre
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
[eh] no no I didn't go audition I attend the workshop first it was a free workshop on sunday <malay>kat</malay> sub station so then <malay>lepas tu</malay> ya [lah] every week I go attend workshop I do I learn about acting
I was doing backstage work
and then <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) one day like (uh) my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything [ah] is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
somehow they get somebody cause <malay>kita</malay> free [kan] they get us to just lie there
lie there then after that I say okay so (um) it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay [lah] my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
like in the middle of the show [lah] before intermission one of the character <malay>cakap</malay> what the character say <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who is this you know then after that reveal [lah] so like !wah! a dead body
and (um)
until the end everybody <malay>dah balik</malay>
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try [lah] two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
but ya [lah] because cannot cannot move [what] so my <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you know
but then <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you cannot move right so you need to learn <malay>macam</malay> your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise <malay>yang</malay> how hard it was until (um) they got a review [lah] somebody wrote a review then <malay>cakap</malay>
complain [lah] they complain <malay>banyak banyak</malay> about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
<malay>cakap</malay> about the best potrayal was the portrayal
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing <malay>bila</malay> I think got this [one] (uh) <malay>kakak melayu</malay>
watching the show and then (um) second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like #astaghfirullahalazim# she was like
[eh]
<malay>orang rupanya</malay> so she was like she was surprised <malay>yang</malay> she so she was shocked [lah] to realise actually I was a real person [lah] so okay
(um) <malay>mula mula</malay> so not wrapped [ah] <malay>macam dorang ada</malay> cover <malay>dengan kain gitu</malay> [ah]

my there will be a set [kan] <malay>kat belakang tu ada macam ada</malay> the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me [lah] ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that [lah] so I
so my leg actually <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] my leg can move but then (err) just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
considered (um)
performance but don't count [ah] they didn't even pay me [seh]
(um) then no we were like training [what] we <malay>wanted macam</malay> training then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that (um) the actor problem [lah] <malay>tak tak selalu tak datang</malay> [lah] <malay>apa tu</malay> hangover [lah] blah blah blah then after that the director <malay>cakap</malay>

there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) can you just
(uh) take over whoever's not here [lah] so I was just doing my job very well [lah] whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
and then my director <malay>macam</malay> !wah! I never knew you can act [eh] so then she text me then say okay then next time (um) can you take over his role [lah] because he's very problematic

that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
[ah]
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay [lah] is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a (um) <malay>apa doktor badut dorang panggil</malay> (um)
no [lah] I think growing up I very you cannot decide [lah] nowadays also I also think about it <malay>kita</malay> we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing [lah] I want to grow up I want to become
power ranger then I was like okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] power ranger but you know
(um)
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist <malay>pasal</malay> my <malay>gigi berterabuh</malay>
my <malay>gigi</malay> I think fall down and then (uh) I all of my front teeth <malay>semua macam</malay>
<malay>hitam</malay> [tau] like <malay>pasal</malay> I think it it was chipped and then after that <malay>ada ada darah</malay> stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
I think it was because I was sick then I realise (ugh) you know what if only I can become a doctor and then (um) I just got the idea from a lot people [lah] one thing I wanted to become scientist also <malay>pasal</malay> that time <malay>pergi madrasah</malay> then after that my <malay>ustazah cakap apa</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau ada lalat tu</malay> [kan] <malay>lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul</malay>
<malay>pasal apa sebelah</malay>

<malay>kepak dia tu</malay> [kan] <malay>satu</malay> one side <malay>kepak dia ada</malay> (uh)
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other <malay>punya kepak tu ada</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> antidote <malay>penawar dia</malay> the medicines I want to say who [ah] I I'm curious [ah]
which side of the of the <malay>kepak</malay> of the <malay>lalat tu yang mana satu</malay> toxic <malay>yang mana satu</malay> what
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course [lah] that
<malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why [eh] [oh] I know why
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I <malay>kena</malay> punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got (err) theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
so <malay>dia cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> cool [eh] <malay>korang apa ni</malay> what you do performance and I enjoy that [lah] but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful [lah]
<malay>pasal</malay> to get into medicine here at that time [ah] for me you need to get straight four A's
and I wasn't doing very well in [eh] no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry [eh] no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] but anyway ya
so ya [lah] and (err) I remember my teacher you know mister #yaz# telling me to like [eh] <malay>bila</malay> ya [lah] where are you going to
just drop one subject [lah] just drop one subject because they were they care so much about <malay>apa ni dia punya</malay> school <malay>punya</malay> standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible [lah] so ya but then in the end I just decided to
(uh) attended this [lah] you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
this person <malay>tak boleh ajar</malay> ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say [eh] you are actually quite good [ah] (uh)
like that [ah] so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay [lah] give you more job [ah] then now I started learn
(um)

<malay>apa tu</malay>
!wah! this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more (uh) but ya got big issue [lah] that [one] until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice [lah] it's really about you say [lah] your marketing
to win your audience (um)
<malay>macam</malay> last time also I was <malay>pakai fikir apa tu</malay> !alah! <malay>nak buat</malay> like I always have this embarrassment [tau] <malay>kalau</malay> everytime <malay>kita buat</malay> show [kan]

the (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
<malay>bila kita</malay> calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even (err) we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada tak ada balik modal</malay>
(mm) then how you guys do it

<malay>apa tak</malay> explain <malay>sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>buka bunga apa</malay> open open flower open flower
(mm)
so it's about really respect [lah] <malay>adat adat adat</malay>
okay then <malay>kalau</malay> martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill (uh) I want (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(um)
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will [lah] [ah]
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move [ah]
the flying the flying arm bar I remember <malay>dia ajar macam mana nak buat</malay> flying arm bar
<malay>ni masih</malay> uni [ah] I think because
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
doing <malay>merepek-merepek</malay> stuff
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
because I did I do film school right so he study <malay>apa tu</malay>
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie [ah] a fighting film [ah]
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps [ah] then I okay then <malay>aku</malay> more to learn [lah] then he show me a flying arm bar
cool [lah] but (mm)
and I don't like to fight [ah]
ya ya ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> I got the video [ah] choreo but I remember it was (uh)
like ya ya so you you hook on to the <malay>tangan</malay> and then after that one of the <malay>kaki</malay> will
ya <malay>gitu sekali banyak kali</malay> [ah] that move actually they look a lot <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> what a lot of the fightings sequences [lah] that kind of hollywood
ya but then no [lah] I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
[eh] you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no [lah] just (uh) (uh) (uh) generic
(um) a lot of the but (uh) just basic ones [lah] very introduction to all the different therapies [lah]
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
<malay>pasal</malay> okay so now [eh] do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know (uh) I was <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend [ah] think of (uh) somebody you <malay>jumpa</malay> every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person <malay>tanya</malay> okay #ayisha# (uh) can I (uh) <malay>macam</malay> stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
[eh] [oh] okay <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [eh]
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
<malay>kalau</malay> an asker
they know <malay>dorang tahu yang apa tu</malay> if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
okay if you can like you said okay can [lah] you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay [lah] two weeks right
but some people they might say that
[eh]
two weeks <malay>macam</malay>
not as <malay>lama</malay> [lah] but they will say like how how could this person even
dare to ask me we're not even that close (um) you know
you know
how dare they ask me like that question <malay>asal dia tak fikir pasal</malay> so there's a lot of like issues that come with it <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
we take that example is not a very good example [lah] like one (uh) like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
you either <malay>macam</malay>
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks <malay>dia macam kurang ajar</malay> [lah] very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
(um)
got the hull invert (um) because they think like <malay>ada</malay>
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that [lah] but then
in the end (um)
but for so that's a point on guesser [lah] so I realised <malay>kita</malay>
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
there's a yes or no (um) people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why [ah] <malay>apa</malay> motive <malay>kau</malay> [eh] what is it for <malay>faham tak</malay>
so I'm learning about that [ah] so it's very (uh) and I (err) so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example [lah]
(uh) [oh] <malay>aku perasan apa yang</malay> you leave your
you clothes around [ah] you know it made me feel (uh) like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel (um)
that
(uh) you feel [lah]
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
that that <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that [lah] I
if you could pick up your own stuff
(um)
would you be doing it [lah] am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well [lah] okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
if it is a western country I think <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay [lah] you ask me then I can say yes I can say no [lah]
<malay>tapi kalau kat sana kau cakap kau boleh tak angkat kau punya baju-baju</malay>
ya it's like a demand [kan] to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how [ah] how to
balance that out I try to figure it out [lah]
ya but won't
(mm)
but they don't understand <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
(uh) <malay>dorang tak faham</malay>
<malay>apa beza dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya I see hard [ah]
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
(um)
<malay>impian</malay> [eh]
<malay>nanti dulu</malay>
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk <malay>apa ni</malay>
but you are following your dreams [kan]
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
