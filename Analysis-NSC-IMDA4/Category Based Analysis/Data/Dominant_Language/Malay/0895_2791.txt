variety show is not scripted too okay
<malay>tak tak semua tak semua</malay>
<malay>tak semua</malay>
<malay>tak semua</malay> I watch #bondi# rescue
#bondi# rescue
<malay>kau tau</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> that #bondi# rescue thirteen season it's to the point that <malay>aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi</malay> lifeguard
(uh) #bondi# rescue is like (mm) <malay>kau</malay> lifeguard so basically you just <malay>jaga</malay> this beach <malay>kau</malay>
no it's not really bay watch this [one] is really real life they're not paid to do o
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday <malay>punya</malay>
no but you know it's very how to say [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam dia puaskan hati kau</malay> [tau] <malay>yang bila diorang</malay> actually
get to save people from drowning
inspire me ya something like that because <malay>aku tengok</malay> [kan] this one season [kan] they <malay>diorang</malay> fail to <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) save this couple [tau] old couple
they are in their seventies <malay>kalau tak salah aku</malay> they only managed to save
<malay>dia ada tiga orang</malay> this couple <malay>dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan</malay> in-laws [lah]
he recalled already buys it architecture in large bigger deeper eight to mature
<malay>kirakan adik ipar</malay> is it <malay>aku pun tak sure</malay>
as in as in brother in-law
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>abang ipar</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>melayu</malay> fail
so basically <malay>diorang bila diorang</malay> [dah] save this <malay>tiga orang</malay> [kan] no <malay>diorang</malay> save <malay>satu aje dahulu</malay> because lifeguards <malay>kat situ empat orang</malay> in duty
three of them just go there and save <malay>kalau ada orang</malay> drown <malay>lagi</malay> how
so basically
in the water face down
float
ya
ya
downing [ah]
<malay>diorang nangis</malay> actually because they couldn't save
<malay>diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu</malay> [kan]
but it's so you know I actually cried you know
<malay>aku nangis</malay> because <malay>aku tengok diorang</malay> actually trying to revive that that couple back
really <malay>diorang</malay> really like went all out
they do is it
<malay>betul</malay> [ah]
ya you know how many minutes not thirty minutes just to revive the person back
that's why they cry because they try so hard <malay>tapi</malay> they try to actually <malay>macam</malay> cover themself up [ah] because <malay>diorang tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>diorang</malay> being
ya so they
ya
<malay>tapi banyak orang</malay> like surrounding <malay>diorang macam</malay> like kind of like <malay>macam</malay> blaming them for not doing their job properly <malay>macam</malay> couldn't rescue them on time
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] <malay>kerja kau</malay> as a lifeguard <malay>kau ada empat</malay> like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me <malay>pada aku</malay> is just so sad
and not being paid also
ya exactly
(uh huh)
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa aku</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ringan</malay>
[oh] <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
ya
[kan] that's why <malay>aku</malay> I wanted to be at that one point of time [ah] because <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>aku</malay> admire <malay>diorang punya</malay> how to say [ah] <malay>macam diorang</malay> punya <malay>semangat untuk kerja</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [eh] after that that three lifeguard [eh] two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was [ah] because they were affected by that thingy
<malay>abeh ada satu lagi</malay> that one episode before <malay>diorang habis tu</malay> season

<malay>dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu</malay> last <malay>dia pergi</malay> that tower where all the lifeguard is there <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat</malay> announcement
<malay>yang kau tahu yang this</malay> one lifeguard actually <malay>cakap yang tadi aku</malay> try save this one old lady

K [lah] after that <malay>bila budak tu patah balik</malay> [eh] <malay>diorang punya</malay> mindset is all the lifeguard <malay>kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu</malay> is <malay>batu bukan orang</malay> it's a good thing
<malay>dia tak</malay> move then after that <malay>bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku</malay> [dah] <malay>cari bapa aku</malay> [dah] <malay>tiga jam</malay>
