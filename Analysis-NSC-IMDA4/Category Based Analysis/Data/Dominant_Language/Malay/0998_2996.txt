then I ask him [eh] you don't want to open your rod <malay>campak umpan</malay> then he was like <malay>nanti</malay> [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> then I was like okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] I go I go change my <malay>umpan</malay>
because at the right side only got because it was this [one] is an open area it's an open area
then there was two ways to go to the sea so the three of them go this way me and I forgot who [ah] I think
#han# [ah] we go to the right so (um)
the the rest of them was doing their <malay>umpan</malay> on the left side so I went to their right side
then <malay>ambil</malay> [ah] <malay>udang hidup pegang</malay> [lah] <malay>benda tu goyang-goyang</malay> then <malay>tengah tengah dah dah dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> poke [ah] <malay>dah</malay> poke the <malay>udang</malay>
then <malay>dah campak dah campak dah</malay> #rilek# [ah] then I was like ya <malay>tengok</malay> it was it's a nice scenery [lah] then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like <malay>itu apa tu</malay> then I I listen closely [lah]
then it was actually <malay>azan</malay> [ah] [ah] three
three <malay>azan</malay> I don't know <malay>azan buat</malay> [lah] <malay>terkejut</malay> I also don't know [lah]
ya three [ah] <malay>azan</malay> then I was like <malay>azan</malay> [eh] then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real [ah] if there is a <malay>kampung</malay> beside [lah]
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask #nos# [eh] #nos# beside <malay>yang tempat</malay> we <malay>pancing</malay> got <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] then <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] then I was like
[oh] <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan</malay>
I heard <malay>ada macam ada orang tengah azan</malay> and I I stood there for quite some time [lah] just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly [lah] [eh] <malay>kau tak bilang</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>kau tak kejut aku</malay> then I was like <malay>apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ</malay>
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there [ah] this [one] was #han# #han# and the rest went I I didn't went there
so he was like (um) <malay>tertidur</malay>
then he tried to sleep you know [ah] he always try to sleep when he <malay>pancing</malay> [one] then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then <malay>dia pusing pusing pusing</malay> then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree [lah] <malay>kat tengah-tengah</malay> in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree [lah] then he saw one <malay>nenek</malay> one <malay>nenek</malay>
walk pass then he was like [ah] the <malay>nenek</malay> told him like #cu# #cu# <malay>dah tahu sini tempat keras</malay> [kan] <malay>asal malap</malay> [jer] <malay>di tempat</malay> you [eh] <malay>macam tempat</malay> you <malay>pula</malay> [eh] no no no not that
why why (um) <malay>malap</malay> [jer] <malay>tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap</malay> like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight [lah] but that day he just never on it [lah] then
#han# already know [lah] he he got experience before then after that he knows that this [one] is
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> this [one] is mystics [lah] like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
(um) like [oh] (err) then he just keep quiet [lah]
keep quiet then #rilek-rilek# then the <malay>nenek</malay> (um) turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that [lah]
then he he knows already [lah] then he just stay awake [lah] then the next day the driver came [ah] came to pick them up
then the driver say got one time he was passing by [ah] at night [ah] then he actually saw at the <malay>pokok</malay> there <malay>ada</malay> (err) <malay>pocong</malay> [ah] <malay>tengah</malay>
so it it means that like that <malay>nenek</malay> come to actually warn them that that place very <malay>malap</malay> then got other stuff also [lah] then that that <malay>nenek</malay> just go there to warn them [lah] like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice [lah] but it's just <malay>malam</malay> ya <malay>malam kena jaga-jaga</malay> ya
that that particular
(mm)
(mm)
but it's not from malaysia [lah] [oh] so they they hear all over
so loud
(mm)
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic [ah]
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this [one] is where the driver will drive [eh] drive then this is an open area <malay>di sini ada satu pokok</malay> in the middle
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
path [ah] actually the right path also can you will see <malay>pulut ketam</malay> in front of you that stretch like that [ah] towards the tip [lah] you can see the whole tip of #pulau ketam#
[ah] I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we [ah] ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move !alamak!
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out [lah] !huh!
[lah] [kan] [eh]
then your past few days <malay>macam mana</malay> your past few months [ah] [ah] the time the last
time I met you then you say you just <malay>berhenti kerja</malay> [pe] you just stop work
(mm)
(mm)
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
so <malay>apa</malay> you you apply mostly what type of <malay>apa</malay> industry
what phone call [eh] <malay>kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau</malay> english all the way [eh] have you never notice beginning
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then (err)
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the <malay>cerita</malay> so <malay>kau dah</malay> apply <malay>kerja habis semua tak dapat</malay> [ah] all all rejected you
ya [lah]
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central (err) [ah] ya
(mm)
within the week
within the month
ya
ya [lah]
<malay>sakit hati</malay> [ah]
surrounding surrounding
surrounding have a few other <malay>masjid</malay> in the east
[ah] okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
[ah]
so what you did you tell anyone no [ah]
but but whose that middle person
(mm)
then different different person
(mm)
#fandi ahmad#
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's why [lah] is
no [lah] I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
you will need to come in and explain to them [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] this the way the reason why I <malay>letak</malay> the moderator first then followed by the asatizah</malay> then followed by (err) #fandi ahmad# is because
(um) according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever (uh) I know that first <malay>kau kena letak</malay> the moderator first
why why why the moderator first <malay>pasal dia yang akan</malay> moderate everything then followed by the <malay>asatizah</malay> who are
who will be the one main speakers [ah] who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then #fandi ahmad# at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that [lah]
[ah]
game [lah]
(mm)
a caricature [lah]
no [lah] to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of <malay>macam situasi</malay> [lah]
(mm)
but this is but this [one] is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help [ah]
ya
ya that's why [lah] that's not like you said [lah] is <malay>tak</malay> professional [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm) ya is a
of course is the comic [lah] because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group <malay>akan dibawa naikkan</malay> to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that <malay>dalam kamu punya</malay> age group [lah] so it's better for you in that sense [ah]
[ah]
yes
ya
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera <malay>dah berapa mahal</malay> then (err) the time you took to edit I actually
<malay>pernah</malay> I <malay>pernah</malay> help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge [ah] <malay>tentang</malay> video [ah] the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship [lah] then after that then <malay>apa tu</malay> the thing is
<malay>kenapa tak ada</malay> any background in Photoshop <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so <malay>nak</malay> edit <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> edit so I ask you for help that time
then after that then the way I see you edit [ah] !aduh! is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that [one] was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was <malay>tak susah</malay> because <malay>tak banyak</malay> animation <malay>tak banyak</malay> at that time [lah] it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence <malay>itu pun dah boleh jadi gila</malay>
then ya I understand because as a programmer <malay>nanti</malay> I do some programs <malay>ke apa</malay> and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later <malay>dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti</malay> [eh] #hakim# (um) actually the client <malay>tak suka</malay> (uh) this part of the game [ah] can change it then <malay>dalam hati aku macam</malay> what it took me hours to get that part working
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research <malay>tengok</malay> whether <malay>apa tu apa yang</malay> client <malay>tu nak</malay> is feasible <malay>tak</malay> can it be included
into the program itself <malay>macam</malay> the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so [oh] <malay>sakit</malay>
definitely [lah]
[eh] feelings feelings
say goodbye
<malay>dengar cerita</malay>
true story actually <malay>sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap</malay>
#sulaiman#
no [lah] is is just <malay>pelik</malay> [lah]
tolong</malay>
<malay>malam jumaat</malay>
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
[oh]
<malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek</malay>
(err) podcast
you know the back to the story <malay>sikit</malay> right just now I talk about my intern so my intern [kan] I was being paid (err) one thousand dollars
per month ya
[eh] #rilek# [ah] #rilek# [ah] <malay>dengar dulu</malay> but but the thing is the time (err) I'm from
so <malay>bila kita</malay> (um) want to sign up for <malay>apa tu</malay> for internship you need to go through this website [ah] I forgot what's the website [oh] my <malay>apa</malay> website <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] website <malay>tu ada ada</malay> [lah] <malay>masih situ</malay> [ah]
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to <malay>gaji</malay> so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over [ah] fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through <malay>gaji</malay> like which one is higher pay [lah]
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address [lah] the address of the company then after that then I was like okay [lah] at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two [lah]
then I went in then I went in #rilek-rilek# talk with my colleagues then got other interns <malay>juga situ</malay> they are leaving already
then I was like [eh] your <malay>gaji berapa</malay> [ah] how much <malay>kau dapat</malay> every month one thousand !huh! [eh] one thousand <malay>sikitnya</malay>
!wah! <malay>sikitnya</malay> one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like [oh] according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know [lah] but
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two [lah] [eh] cannot be [what] no there's no there was it's just allowance
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like <malay>apa hal ni</malay>
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and [eh] boss (uh) can ask you something [ah] yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask [ah] the the allowance
is one thousand [ah] because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand [ah]
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
<malay>malas</malay> you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay [ah] once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay [lah] <malay>rezeki di mana-mana</malay>
no you will say can <malay>boleh macam mana</malay> [oh] you need to sign up this you need to do that [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay>
I give it to you
typical malay [ah]
!aduh!
<malay>kau nak doa lapan minit kau pergi doa</malay>
actually I so
just asking [ah] I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple [lah] keep it simple
#mat-mat# #mat-mat# [ah]
nothing [lah] it's nothing nothing much
[ah] so little bit [lah] just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school [lah] [ah] [oh] ya talking about
Grab [lah] last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see <malay>macam dia punya</malay> timeline [ah] like what do you
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
<malay>kau cakap kau nak kerja</malay> Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo [oh] <malay>betul</malay> [eh] <malay>jauh</malay>
because I I myself also got (um) work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is [ah] the pay to me is I tell you [lah] it's quite it's quite [ah] quite decent for I would say (err) part time [lah] because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get [lah] so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
if you if you hustle even more <malay>macam</malay> hustle <malay>demi</malay> hustle [jer] is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that [one] is motor [lah] but ya [lah] but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you really can't get anything because <malay>apa tu</malay> okay [lah] I got learn some finance also [lah] [kan] you should know [lah] so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in [lah] rather than just <malay>duit terkeluar duit terkeluar</malay> then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the <malay>rezeki belum masuk lagi</malay> in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders [ah] per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
take off like okay [ah] <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat</malay> [ah] I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
a good place for you to like start [lah] then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
from your house <malay>sini jalan kaki</malay> #punggol# #sengkang# further [eh] macritchie further
<malay>mana</malay> [seh]
marina barrage

so fast then why why when we

maybe maybe we I should I should start with you [ah] what nine five five
<malay>macam</malay> might as well [lah] I park my motor somewhere
