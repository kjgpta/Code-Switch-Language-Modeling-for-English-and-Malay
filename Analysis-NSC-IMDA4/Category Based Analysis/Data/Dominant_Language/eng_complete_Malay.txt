ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
that's considered a lot ah like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay lah enough what
no five K one person
but that's not bad what you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay ah
I think something right starting another business sia
like six eh seven to three jer
so it's not like very long hours
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall

ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K

but
earn a lot but you say the expansion though she cannot wait for one shop she open
fusion
eww
eh actually can try sia if it's nice
at where
oh really
wow
one day I should try also maybe we should go
I
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
for that shop
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
they are at home what
that's why they
same
don't let you what
around in singapore
oh
like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital
uh ya ya
okay

eh then you pass by so fast eh
don't you think so like with COVID like wow where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling eh do you miss travelling
ya but if mm you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to uh
um like before COVID lah
new
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van wah love those time seh
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
oh my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
mm
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand lah you mean
okay
mm mm
uh huh
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
oh I see like how much it's supposed to cost ah
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
oh wah were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him lah
mm
start of an adventure eh
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
eh wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like uh
mm mm
mm
oh I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
mm
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
mm
okay
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the prata was huge
then
oh
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
ah okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
oh
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me lah I've never I've never encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees ah it's just the shoppers will probably be like ah what are we going to do now at such an early time like uh we still want to shop
oh K K eh what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
mm
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay lah not a lifelong dream but
ya lah ya lah that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy kan
ya ya that's why lah
mm
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
wow okay
mm
mm
um circles and stuff
active eh ah okay
oh right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas ah

it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya mmhmm
err yes yes
ya ya
mmhmm
mm
um
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
uh
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
err yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
first time impression or
ah okay
mm
mmhmm
okay
uh I think will be mindset slash personality wise

ya that
I hate
uh
mm
ya okay the
uh
okay no before
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
mm
mm
subjective lah also
mm
mm
practical they're quite practical
is
uh ya
comparing ya mm
ya better
mm ya should we move on
mm
beauty standards is it
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
yes
mm suicide
oo
mm
mm
ya I think uh
err yes yes
uh yes
mmhmm yes
uh if there's a term
uh if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional um
ya dysfunctional um um ya so it's basically like the society is not
uh it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the uh beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
so I think ya
yes yes any ya any competition also
ya yes yes yes
ya I'm not really sure what's the term lah but ya
mm
mm

yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
mm
so ya
ellen degeneres
mm true true
mm
mm
mm
yes
ya okay then we shall end this recording here
alright thank you

I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days ah like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and err the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they uh they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me ah I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about oh no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about johor do you remember going to johor
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old johor house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old johor house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
mmhmm now the closest to johor we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there ah
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at uh pulau ubin what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so um what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
mmhmm
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to bugis like literally a five minute walk to bugis if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to bintan
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said oh we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like ah we're choosing to go to hong-kong oh why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya oh what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should uh and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor
okay bye

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially uh
money making invention business so basically is
the coding lah hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it wah then I'll be woo
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

here mmhmm
so unless when you still go to work at this place then Alisha you know go out together with you or you send Alisha to school right and then you know you go to work
and then oh but then you will be going back first
and then
the only way is to wait for news from then only then can plan

mm mm
oh is it very near
mm
correct
ya
alah he'll be it
ya he can do it lah
he's the type who's like
you know he can study on his own he's quite independent

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
yes
cause
when
and like you know I have I've ever gone
not really ah
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
yea
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
huh
what
why
oh okay
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle what
besides
you know the
lanzhou beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes oof
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah oh my god
you know just now
tender
but
the what reason
pettiest
mm
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
oh my god is that your
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
they are like
how I say eh
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no lah I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
ya so like
uh actually
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
ah this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of uh jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah uh that should be my answer but if
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
that's what I feel lah because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence ah on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
mmhmm
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
but then
at forty two eh forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but uh
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at ah
mmhmm
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
mmhmm but the moral is don't give up ah
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said ah everything you explore
on after the next day
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at lah
mmhmm
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
wow okay
okay
that's the first wish eh
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this one it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
um
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
yes
yes
yes
mmhmm
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
the society's
yeah
mmhmm
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
oh yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like oh my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
mmhmm
I mean
that's good for you lah because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me ah I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook oh
why didn't you take culinary eh
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
oh okay
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
precisely what I what I I said lah it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
italian
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay ah what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
yeah
no no no no no no I'm not gonna say that
no it's not
yeah yeah I have another one
I already have my answer
it was
yeah yeah it was sweet it was cute like I
we wanted
we wanted to do something lah
oh eh
oh a'ah
but ya so
so like
I remember that
ee

oh my god Nandos
oh my god they're the worst
oh I think you told me before
ya ya ya
definitely lah
oh yeah you have that once a year kind of
yeah I know
it happened this year
yeah
yeah it happened
it's something lah I think you I didn't sleep on that day
I remember I didn't sleep in January because you wanted me to stay because you were sick
yeah
I have one stupid question
I saw one
would you rather fight
one horse-sized otter
or a hundred otter-sized horses
you would you rather fight one horse-sized otter
you know otters right
or one hundred otter-sized horses
I
I think
I think I will fight the one horse-sized otter
but holy shit
yeah but it's like there's too many of it hundred eh
ya at least one horse-sized otter you can just run away from that one thing and is very big you know where it is
right
yeah
then at least you know where to you know who to run away from
this
and horses eh imagine you close your eyes a hundred horses even though it's more
horses
ah come on you know what I'm gonna choose
doctor stranger
duh
freaking cool
because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange I can go into places I can look at places I can look in the future I can look in the past I can go back and do this
there's so many things I can do
ya but I know what to do
if you I know when you gonna die
ya so like like that that that scene lah he went through with how many only fourteen million plus
timeline and there's only one that worked and he knew what to do
to make sure that one work
get it so that's what I'm going to do
so I'm going to like go into time
and like choose the best
timeline
then I'm like ah this one will do
get it yes
and and he's intelligent also so
oh my god I can't wait for the new one to come out I want to watch
I wanna watch

I can't wait
it's
hmm
what do you deserve
oh okay
so metaphorically
metaphorically
oh so now you hate the the oh shit
and then
it
you get ignorance
hmm
I don't know what I'm gonna get
why
why
think I will get
a food that is intimidating
what you mean there's
to you lah because I I talk to you as a as a partner I don't talk to you as a
that's not what I get from everyone
that's not what I what I get from everyone else when I step into the room ya you you ask all my juniors
I have when I'm in work mode
they are scared
you know I'm just saying like I have that
work switch you know
so that that work switch and that
that
that aura that I bring when I'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable
that's what I got from people
it's not something that I think I am myself
but that's what people have been telling me
and I feel that has to change
if you want to teach someone you wanna help someone you can't be intimidating
yeah
favourite fast food

jet planes on a hospital up till today I cannot
swallow that
idea at all its so
hmm
um

unless unless it's fried chicken
yeah
after cooking I'm talking about like like raw ingredient
I eat fishcake
well
you know
I
but that one
repercussion
yeah I like it
duh of course it's not
it's not
that
yeah
ya lah
I haven't had any
for
the last time I had was that one I had when I went to bugis plus with you
yeah exactly
that's like
that's like way before I had dengue seh
like a month at least
a month plus
no
I don't need bubble tea
I rather Boost
like
yeah yeah
and I when I was gym-ing ah
and I gain a lot of muscle mass
ya and and my dinner is like
why
mm
okay it's one hour already yes we did it
yay okay bye bye
bye

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that one you have to talk to the experts ah
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
ah not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
eh so that's about superpower lah
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
ah
or because I can

uh
the
email right
not yet
nope no emails yet
not yet
it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage
eh
they detect eh this saturday wow it's handy
so fast
oh ah
I need to do my report soon
no you soon
you get better
eh today's is what
nineteen
today is nineteen see
I'm not working I still can get the dates right
I buy something lah
later you get tasha to I think we have nuggets hashbrown finish
fries finish
nuggets only then maybe if you want desperate lah
the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing
haris haris haris coughing
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together
oo
K
um
yup can
god
received the message eh the email tau
ah
because I only have class dojo
class dojo is like only
apa
find it weird
duchess soon I think double lah when they send you parents gateway then I also got it on class dojo
mister po everytime I receive message we said oh
so that's why I ask her wait your your teacher never eh set one set two same so I don't know where set three is
other classes because of subject bending
mm
they try to natasha nadia also don't have any changes
eh but I don't know lah eh
hmm

ah I'm good I'm good
okay everything is normal but then
err yes err
like one of them err
is now doing the parking the parking
and then err anas is
doing err more of for farming
eh ya ten dollars lah
just to err
err so corn is a one year harvest program lah something like that
ah so if one year harvest corn then one year later
how's the the the the the situation there
oh okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from err batam I I know you went batam but I when did you went to batam
you went there for your business
I see
ah okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve err november
orh then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks lah ah
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain lah facebook lah they say not nice lah some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from batam or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
ah
ah
ah okay okay okay so you you
batam from batam you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
but I'm not sure
mm
okay
very
ah it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years lah probably
ah maybe
ya lah too much lah this one ah anyway ah so your two weeks how okay everything
ah
ah
orh
ah
uh huh
okay lah
ah okay
ah so now after that you doing deliveroo ah okay lah deliveroo so usually what time you start for weekend for your deliveroo I mean as in food delivery
ah
okay
mm
oh
okay
ya true true true
you manage your own time you manage your own money everything is you on your own lah okay lah
ya true
talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks dah end of the year already wah very fast man correct or not ah
alamak
ah
this is a new beginning ah they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know lah ah I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march eh
but but very fast ah nine months
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one ah that's what they said is probably two two lah so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
mm
okay lah spend money in singapore lah staycation now government give ah hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel lah I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go err places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass ah and then from there then you can use lah you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay lah they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore lah but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one lah so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period ah
eh
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo jurong bird park sentosa I don't want lah so all these places went already ah so I need to go something different ah maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night ah maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels lah you want to go those like hotel ah of course you need to come out still same price lah not much difference ah anyway
ya
ah
serious ah
government give us ah
mm
ah
ah okay okay I understand
ah so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing lah
huh
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah lah example ah one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
huh
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
huh I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then uh hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up what then what's the point of
huh
bullshit
huh
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive what right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now ah
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
oh that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better what
funny ah
why ah like that
anyway
ya
ah ah
ah and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars oh my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe ah maybe whoever pick up that story ah and then share share share share ah
I do not know ah shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is johor one is woodlands so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet ah whoever pick up that story ah go viral ah
no lah he I think yes he no eh
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual err wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel kan for him
ask his wife to come singapore ah bring in
he is going back to johor
so he's
then after that he's
oh he is going back johor now
then
no pay leave two months lah singapore no pay leave two months ah
ah then after that bring in the wife come singapore
huh
oh ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia johor you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation lah
but singapore
the the the cases zero what community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise lah
I mean if if if now err the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go johor knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny lah they all anyway
it's okay lah at least happy for him lah at least you know see his wife
mm
investment lah it's good investment lah
ah
ah
ah
the two weeks
that one two weeks two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps ah they got apps like zumba lah exercise lah yoga
ah then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this err food
so now we are
for what
okay
ah
ah okay lah
ah
ah I see okay lah
ah so call like a whole set lah
ah
okay okay okay
so he did that also lah
but now because of this COVID thing lah
so for me nowadays you you see my new family cusina
oh ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing ah because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation eh whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
ah is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and err gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place lah be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put err err err
different taste local of a filipino taste lah so yes we did that already so alhamdulillah there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made ah
hopefully lah
a'ah
ah
correct
ah
ah
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully lah ah be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet lah because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first uh uh
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it err
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert lah then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay lah good lah I was thinking
correct
true
ya lah

ya
ya
how the worst
but is it reported to the authorities or not

alright alright
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
no lah I think for them maybe is about
okay so six get already then after that we err
err until six thirty five then
yes
censored ya so sulaiman was there to pee lah then after that err not long after that lah my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so sulaiman will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for sulaiman he only peed once I peed
enjoy the enjoy
ya
that's life that's life
I see I see so so
sorry
ah
ah
uh huh
mm mm
seven ah ah mm
mm mm
pulau ketam lah
so you mean basically the uncle brought you from changi all the way to pulau ketam
so you mean to the jetty then taxi van mm
ya lah cause the way you say was like did I did I skip the taxi thing or like
ah
mmhmm
mm seriously
how sia
like saw sia
aduh aduh okay so the crabs err
ah
no fish no crab ah ah ah
mm mm mm mm mm
eh eh ah okay
wah same man wan five give me high five
mm okay alright so this wan one ah ah
supper Milo
one of a kind
wait the context this is taking place at where again
ah
mm mm uh uh
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
ah okay but three mm okay
okay carry on carry on
mm
mm mm
mm
mm mm
ah
ah ah I need to remember but ya mmhmm
mm
daring daring
mm mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ish ish mm mmhmm mmhmm
ish ish of course not nice
three three testing ah sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see ah uh huh ah
oh the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of pulau ketam from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in lah maybe a place I've never been in before lah
oo that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to punggol to already
orh aduh so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
oh here comes the big one and uh instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your pulau ubin story thank you so almost for sharing
err time check this one I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually err after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot lah I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit lah ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
lah kan lah kan eh yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months ah ah
okay so for now the same thing lah just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for err I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being err more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on lah
I think slowly lah eh because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed lah I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more lah ya so just err pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
err with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then inshallah when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck lah then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that err it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I alhamdullilah I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it lah if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application lah
err wah cannot I cannot think that means a lot already lah
err
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've err sent for has been
err civil service err healthcare err cleaning err
around those lah is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call lah
ya lah so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
the rejection is the best part ah silence which is the most annoying part because technically eh by right the most professional way for is
at caldecott area there err more of central macritchie lah macritchie reservoir ah so it's there
then err then
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that err we'll just keep in touch err within the week we'll call you back
err with every passing day err when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish lah like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings ah playing my heart
ah
so
so okay so basically err
then
ya so so that's the story lah the middle person err
err eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
my number to this err communications officer lah then err after that
is fandi ahmad fandi ahmad
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment lah so okay err I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
then mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
you know because for my for me err the the thing is me and this err officer
eh not call lah Whatsapp me say eh sorry shazwan we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
err so the officer said
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say lah err it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya
ya lah so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
that's why mm yes mm
the video lah kan the video
uh
mm mm mm ya
ah aduh
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense lah because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
mm mm mm
mm
mmhmm mm mm mm
err no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings err time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
err the fishing ah the fishing mine in the beginning right we already talk so that's why we like awkward a bit now now still awkward lah cause now we talking to you it's just
today is not we today we cannot say
err we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning oh damn
so yes err these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but hey you are a
listener
best per month pe not like the whole internship
yes uh
uh uh okay
ah okay okay highest
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
ah
mm mm
is it is it mm mm
then alamak
mm mm
then you you you the man you lead my country
I don't need to worry too much you you you do your thing I do mine
so hopefully for you listeners out there I don't even know if you will listen or use it straight to the machine the will have to understand cause if they have to understand man eh
mm mm mmhmm
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya lah we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step lah like we said as malay
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the mat-mat accent
but the mat-mat accent but I think
it's nothing is not like the plastic moved by itself or anything yes alright okay
it's too far you carry on you want no problem no problem you take your time
uh huh basically Foodpanda basically Deliveroo
Grab Foodpanda ah decent lah this kind of job ah
ah mm mm
mm
uh huh
if you if you not malay lah if if you really really do the extra step
your outstanding mm
around there yes
ah ah ah
mm mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya lah interview mm mm mm
ya
mm so if you were to times four for the month is one K your internship
but this time you can enjoy what you do cause your internship you have to listen to people say make changes but for you you make the change you go from one place deliver the food to the other
mm per day lah
mm
speaking about fitness I actually went on a hike two weeks ago
yes yes no no further no
I don't know how to say but I feel like it's further
close change the last part
I walk from my house I cut through bedok I reach east coast park I walk along the whole east coast park reach the gardens by the bay
from east coast to marina barrage two hours
because
you start from tekong around the area tekong and then you walk that extra mile tampines to here is your other one and a half hours
that's why it's long just join lah that's why I buy this thing
might as well park my

just now you say what Pan Pacific hotel is it
actually I thought um
december lah better
so I
oh still got school holiday meh
oh I okay
but I just check the price first just now you say Pan Pacific right
then we'll see
okay
but why ah you
this one ah
ya
okay
err actually the
the actual date is
seven and eight of november
need five adult
one children
okay
wow
amazing the price
before the what
oh that one that one we haven't plan yet
but knowing angah I think he wants to eat
aww this one is nice
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel eh
because the Amara hotel what what my uh what I
thought that I
err should do right
is I will take two separate room
at least they can spend the night together
there
oh they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay lah
let's see the photos
Amara
huh got no plate
Maggi
because like how mah want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay lah ilham can sleep outside
ya
this one oh okay dah I think this is the one that I wanted to take
angah don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
okay this one is for three adults right
they can sleep
on the floor lah of course lah with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that lah as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
is it
mm
mm
mmhmm
that sounds fun
can consider
or the another one is this one also Ascott oh the price oh my god
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
mm
oh when are we receiving that ah
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
oh ya hor
mm)(mm)(mm
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward lah but I think he
I think he don't mind
no eh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why ah why you don't like it
oh is it
what did you have
a a what
oh
mm okay lah I will decide
oh ya ya ya
mm
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that um indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird lah so when I taste it eh I thought that it's going to be bad but then like oh my god it's so nice
err I ate the prawn green curry you the naan
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we uh we
mm it's too loud mm
because we we passed by and then after that we thought eh
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay lah
and then I don't really like udon
that's why maybe I don't mm
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
err okay lah I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like uh
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar tau for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
naan
okay lah it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay wow I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
mm mm mm
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm
ya
mm
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in bali remember the the Yoshinoya
the yakiniku beef
is it the same thing
ah
but then that one the one that I ate also called yakiniku beef why
oh wait
maybe maybe maybe
oh is it
mm
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose mee soto
oh okay
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know what
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like um
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it lah
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
oh but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity ah rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like oh my god oh my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the wayi can just like err can I
ya can I just like err take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
err helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room uh house is like seven million
err with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets err attached uh with uh indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary siol
I don't think I can
don't ah
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
ugh
mmhmm
and then they put there as a meme
okay oh ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
oh you mean like okay okay I don't know
hmm
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
ah okay then that kind of deal like okay lah meh I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay lah maybe that one is a bit worse
like huh one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard lah
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body ah
ha
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like ugh
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like uh
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things lah maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
err
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients eh no no no uh like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
ah I like like ya I like uh true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news oh I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are um
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
uh or like paranormal activity all these like
um uh cable uh ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
err ya ya ya
ya
mm
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what ah
ah chris watts ah is it the chris watts
the one that she the one that the the
ya the one that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
um
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can uh on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay lah maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix one eh
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
uh I mean he's a narcissist what uh eventually he will just gonna act that oh no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding eh prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
err the girlfriend lah but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious lah
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like um
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle lah like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like uh grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the one that
I had after I had
aryan after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
uh healthy okay lah healthy is subjective lah
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young kan so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
err they need I have to
do it
for them
ah and then my third wish actually
uh I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still uh I'm already pretty
oh I
err when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
err uh um lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head kan I will actually really think like then I was like eh like quite sad lah like
they are somebody's
err
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad lah
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
oi
baby love
no more new K says
ya
at sembawang
mmhmm
so could you
huh
who
oh is it
wait your workplace got intern
like
and the community centre
ya they actually intern
what what do the intern do what what course is he from
why you met you gift
ha
okay ya
ya
ya I mean why you do you want to be there for your intership like what would you gain or
what could you possibly not learn from before that you know at school
that's weird
hmm
ah
there's there's
is it the same as our here is that how you all sit at

mm
mm
to um
mm
mm
they just go there to like see whether like oh like everything like ah okay I go lah and ask
mm
they'll go
oh is it
mm mm mm mm
to
ya
then you turn around then you see that eh you know like
um
huh
ya
it's not at can I take it out
huh
you go ah
ya
then you call in then you should call in to first and ask what what what they can do
you know like say help aryan aryan
correct correct you can definitely uh look up
unless if you cannot find whatever that you're you you want to know online then no choice ah you need to go down what
and then if your mum
you know like cannot go down you go down first lah like check it out for her what's the problem
that some some people just think that we actually don't want to help them
you know because like we want to do the easy way out
but actually we really cannot help
don't want change colour
ah
oh okay
mm
huh
nothing to do with race what
eww aryan
but that time you say you want interview right
eh
Ministry of Manpower
for
wait what sorry for the that what position
oh
what what what what will you do if you get the job like what will you do
dormitory
ah okay okay
mm mm mm mm mm
why
oh is it
but then the pay is is the same ah
as
that one higher ah
november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
err actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation lor
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya lah I pass
so
you know that day I went for uh a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
and white lodge is um
it's a private uh institution
ya it's a private err it's a private school lah it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's uh it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge um
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in ah okay like the the one I went I went uh from eight thirty to one
I have to err assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates lah but they are they are like
one teacher err to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then um
after that the okay so what I did was like uh
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
um I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children lah um okay the first half the eight thirty to
um
for kids that uh the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
ang moh
and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh
like um japanese and japanese korean and uh sweden
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local one
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international uh so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
orh ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five lah
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because uh if you go under government
saturday you're uh open half day
then you need to alternate working ah
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this one like saturday sunday you are closed and then what I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower lah
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see uh what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters lah like
err and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the uh
they call me they call me miss
hu
because they don't my my name is very long right then like uh okay never mind uh just okay just call me miss hu
okay then after that they
oh got one kid say uh miss hu can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
um can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like whoa eh
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so ah
a'ah
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this uh one um one
uh no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
uh one kid is err
ya
half german half japanese so
um
tell us like okay uh
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like uh and then the kids will like orh then they will uh
uh
attempt to attempt to say the language also lah
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because uh the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys lah girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime uh they uh then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
mm
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already dah
feed breakfast lah
they have like a snack lah like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that uh doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one kan
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later lah
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
err when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring lah
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no uh you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like oh my god uh and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

alright
alright mahirah
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
beauty in everyone okay this is a
yes
okay
for me
for me okay aku
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
beauty in a long term woo
mmhmm
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
mm
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
mm
go towards the beauty or
oh damn
mm
mmhmm
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are um
which is um it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them lah
ya very subjective
mm
true true but overall selecting friends with with uh with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not uh it's not the right way to do lah I would say
so ya it's not
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
it's not it's unfair what because you should pick someone of uh of of talent of skills instead of beauty
mm
oh yes
pay plays an important role
mm
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
a a partner in life your uh
uh huh
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance one or not
true true true true
me too me too
I think I think
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
mm
mm
mm
what's the point kan
uh I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself err
things like that this little things that will build up um
stressful for some people
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
handsome
ya
if uh can you make me uh beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
oh that means when if I'm beauty
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
yes yes
yes
oh wow
girls or boys
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
but
ya
really
practical
mm
you can say err comparing eh comparing
uh judgy but
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then uh uh most likely is the
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia it's all uh human standards
which I think is
this one is is this this kind of thing lah that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
oh dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something eh
mm
mmhmm
functional eh
oh ya
ya competition err competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
there there will be a president there will be uh our manager there will be our the boss
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be uh
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
oh my god like
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
uh same like macam
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side err but the the the the negative side about
the look at the people will just support this uh this the group of
based on their
so that is the negative side lah about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way lah but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
mmhmm
true true
uh it's okay err but like eh like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example eh and then you call you wear uh
as time goes by
uh better and more uh
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay um
mm
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
wow okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it mm
true true
oh yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean um ya ya ya
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I would say today this
uh of uh twenty twenty of the twenty first century
it's not um it's because uh as technology evolves we evolve
uh facebook twitter youtube
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a uh company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
uh stage you know what I mean
uh
have the same people that will hold you back
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
fashion wise uh people are now using uh fewer are following the more of the K pop
go jer
mmhmm
value is it popular popularity mm
mmhmm
self love
okay for me
as long as you know
where
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that uh circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find uh someone that really is genuine in your friendship
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
so go ahead like um move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
yes I I still remember our first our first
so and
sec um
not at for us err we don't we don't we don't go to that direction
so that's a good thing
I I see the like our
no point also lah judging like move on lah move on
our circle of friends ya friendship
yes yes yes correct
yes there is
wah you you got you got the face man
ya you got the face you got the physic
okay mira filzah is the uh actress in malaysia

those who have that
um like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same lah just human being
ya
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself lah

for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
uh the respect that you you're given by society that is more
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or

okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
mm
mm
mm
mm okay so because kan you are the type of
mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
uh
so it was a bit weird lah ya
I know right oh my gosh ya
enjoying my sleep lah
then after that leh
the car outside kan
the but then I try to look out the window lah I wanted to kaypoh lor
and uh
ah so ya like that lor
so that's what happened
then after that
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
okay
oh
oh my god
eh that's so bad leh
mm
oh
so that's where I get my news also lah TikTok and Instagram
ya
the presidential debate
ya so
I understand
so ya so then kan
ah you know actually this year
save money so that I can like buy a house here
ah okay
oh
oh
oh oh that's very good
okay
ya
so then it's like
it's like if you have in the reports kan it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
you know or uh
and actually touch all these
ah
ah
and looking forward to phase three lah
okay
ya
oh
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
ya
ya lor that's true
if let's say you were the prime minister
okay
of the highest number of COVID cases
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
okay
oh that's not good
mm
ya
ya
as if lah it's so easy kan
mmhmm mm mm
it
so
so ya
so then
so today
so then oh uh so that's why this morning
I'm
so the breakfast wrap was only four dollars sixty five cents
but
uh it's one for one so end up the thing became only two dollars lah
so ya
ha and some more my pillow covers are all white
so it's like the thing turned red lah because
it will stain or if I wear anything white it will stain
ya but whose hair will be after you dye
exactly
ya but then but when it's wet it will stain my towel lah
mm
so ya lor like that lor
and then
eh
wow and I didn't
um this is for you and I was like oh
okay actually I didn't order this uh
uh ordered it oh okay
it's a local delivery
ya lah
sometimes my mum is okay lah
then
mm oh
the
mini golf kan
Holey Moley
norza
a'ah I went with her
orh
wah that's very good
okay but it's not too late for me to start
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
ha
huh
okay
for lah oh okay
ah
mm
mm
oh okay okay
okay
mm
unless we have this type of project lah
ya you know a little bit of extra do no harm lah kan
mm
so
mm
not right not right now only that I want to take my time and then we see what happens lah
mm
ya
so and and then actually
mm just
you know
have a career change
mm
mm
ya and then we ya so
and then so that's why it's a bit like
so ya
mm
like singapore living cost is a bit high
save a little bit more to make sure that you know that your parents are well taken care of lah so
step by step I guess one day at a time
mm
mm
mm
um
hong kong paris dubai
mm
kan
ya
eh
the furthest he will go is changi
the furthest he will go is changi
he won't go anymore where further than that
mm
mm
ya
that travel agencies will bring her to all these weird places kan
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
oh my gosh
right
ya
orh
only when I'm at home
mm
ya that's true
so then that what is the point of taking the leave you see
on leave
then I also take the leave
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm okay okay I see I see
mm I see
ya
so ya so you know I wrote an email to my management err my housing management because like
um
ya
to um
you know make sure that the the rubbish is thrown properly and responsibly lah ya
you mean I stand outside the rubbish chute and wait for the person to not throw the rubbish
no lor on the floor every floor or itself don't have the lor only got is in lobby
mm
um
oh okay
korean drama K drama is like
not really my thing lor but then I can try lah see how lah
a'ah
mmhmm
ya exactly
is that the word you were looking for
ya
not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs lah
then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
a'ah
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
mm
ya
huh
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
mm
so they are all back in lockdown
mm
mm I think so
mm
and the infection is is more um
the the virus is more infectious
mm
mm
uh
job offers
mm
mm
ya
you
become prolonged because
err
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
uh nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
mm
mm
ya
exactly
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes lor
hmm so ya
uh and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
mm
ya
mm
a'ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
um hmm
and then had to like
mm
mm
mm
mm
orh
presentation
oh
ya
ya
oh
oh
ya very like uh demotivating lah
mm
oh
oh media agency lah
mm mmhmm mm mm
mm
like err
ya
ya
mm
ya so
anyway
err
mm ya
okay
okay thank you bye bye

eh bro long time no see ah
not that ah actually cause I just got sacked ah by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
err around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful lah cause
I got to travel to different countries ah
among all the countries I would say
uh saudi arabia cause uh it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion lah
err
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
uh finding oh discovering new food there the arabic food was
I would say I would want to go to
spain ah cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
err I want to go to barcelona cause
whole uh football period uh resumes
uh
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
probably can last me for six months ah if I really err spend accordingly and safely lah and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
four thousand wah that I think that's a lot eh for a part-time job
oh I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
uh moving forward
it will be a tough period lah for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
mm
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs lah you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that lah cause as we um you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
err the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important ah in singapore
uh ya I get that a lot lah I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
err it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you lah but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided err you are not doing overtime or what lah
so ya two thousand is not enough lah at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that err or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling lah you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and um the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them eh sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children lah you know maybe
for err
ya I really agree on that lah we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know err
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right wah my house ah I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you lah to ah hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time eh you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
uh this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news lah I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry lah to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree ah there are multiple aspects that um lead to err emotional err depression
or probably um
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right um financial
uh issues I think is the most depressing issue lah
you know cause
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with wah sorry with whatever I'm having lah you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period lah for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think ah I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very uh depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also err came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID lah I mean some people
err actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why lah I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything lah that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
um hold the border
to some uh high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news lah maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
uh explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the uh about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
uh was tortured was raped in front of other people
uh
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's err moral morally right lah I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
err don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say uh history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being uh killed
err you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
err
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
err I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really err
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community ah be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it err it err really err bring a hole
intentionally in front of people wah that was another level of murder I would say lah
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
err we did have I mean we do have uh casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it lah
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such uh racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others ah you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist lah
ya I heard that um
the malays do have more privilege than uh comparing compared to other races ah know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a uh national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country lah you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example ah
you and your neighbour
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard lah I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean uh but then ya that's what I heard lah when you are chinese indian
uh sarawakian or sabah you know someone from sabah
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
a clinic I don't know you could err easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say ah but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be err it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being ah you know
they are they are going to get charged in court eh I know you confirm know ah who's that guy ah najib uh najib razak and some other
his uh friends getting charged at court cause
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years ah but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way uh you know they
they uh give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny lah but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
ah our ministers in singapore is acting and how uh well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very uh
I would say ah I don't know what to say ah it's very good lah I would say what you think about that
uh ministry like for example financial or et cetera lah and but then
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke lah I mean have you watch the singapore one
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister shanmugam and mister what it's called ah mister vivian balakrishnan the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
you being a minister you will only err how to say uh not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do lah you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with uh in a higher position right they seem uh they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it lah so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most ah I repeat again most ministers
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
huh so you willing to wake up in the
um
uh maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
err like I said lah having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
uh ya I mean I do agree lah on what you are what you just speak you know but uh
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past uh thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
err no I I don't
I mean I might sound
err like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships lah
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong ah
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said lah I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
it's embarrassing ah I mean this is not some gender inequality lah but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that um ya actually women ah do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
uh have to lead them lah I mean I mean this topic is very err subjective lah you know but I think in singapore women are really um having a good career earning more than man I would say
um
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding ah
I mean actually
and stuff and um
anyway ah it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye

okay uh my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing uh marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
err okay first
uh higher NITEC but then I found out that uh
I got a chance to go ah because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly err through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
like why why are you not uh interested
mm
uh
what else
okay uh so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay lah
ya
for me is uh
uh
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
apparently now is muay thai
which I find uh more interesting than the others ah in terms of
err social connection and all that
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because uh
I guess now muay thai is going well so far
uh training quite intense so ya
oh
competition uh
not not a performance kind of competition lah
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
mmhmm
okay secondary school life okay actually because err
so
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it ah and I go through it ya you go
mm
ah
so
is naughty eh
uh
my choice ah because err sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
secondary school that is known to be
uh for like naughty kids ah and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the uh the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
why you never go for the interview and all that
he's like oh ya ya you're a student counsellor what ya ya so I
wasn't expected ah but then I was just like
okay lah never mind I just I just take the role lah do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like err
naughty stuff that I did at least
ah
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
other then that uh not much ah
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
ya like I think right after N level ah
still retail the the best uh job that I did lah as experience because okay I started
err in twenty seventeen which is err N level twenty seventeen after N levels uh
I join uh because a lot of my classmates work there also
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun lah for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent ah because usually
err we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
mm
oh
a lot
mm
mm
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also ah and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
mm
so
err actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then err so compared to retail
err in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then uh imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like err how how can I help you then they like oh no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes ah then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king lah
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did err
photo booth err
kind of job
and then
the pay was quite good ah like three hours
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
which was fun ah I got experience a lot
uh ya
that's all for the job experience ah
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute eh
it was terrible but uh
err I think part of
the job experience also is why we
uh business and all that
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup
ya
yup
shore
mm
so six months sailing
just one month of it how how can I cope lah
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of uh career
for me
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore err
exciting ah
ah
so think is okay lah
to have a stable living ah for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family lah
nine to five job kan
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
to be really you with your family ah and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
mmhmm
yup
you can pull down ah ya you can come back to shore maybe err continue as lecturer I you relax ah ya
mm
okay
mmhmm
ya
uh
so uh
police
uh it was a
ya
and it was like
oh what what yes
uh
that sense of err
ah ah
why ah
ya
frogmen
mm
so
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
mm so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test ah
mathematics lor they call it arithmetics
uh
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
err at that point of time
pay is
but that's the air force ah I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
uh
so
but
mm
mm
then hopefully just continue marine engineering lah
the different opportunities
ya consider
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup uh I I don't mind any uh what you call that like areas ah
mm
ya
ya
so
ya
but ya
what else
mm
what about copy ah
primary school life
spent there six years eh primary school
which are compared to our different stages lah
ya
ya
ya
mm yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending ah
ah the jump style
it's about err other than that
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
I was quite small in terms of size
err whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said oh you you sub the big one with the small one ah
but I I didn't mind lah because I know my potential and then from there uh
so
by primary
ya so
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
so so ya
ya
tekong
uh depends
okay usually striker is on your on the tekong's right
and then feeder is on the tekong's left
ya
usually striker and jumper for right leg
ya
wah I think after almost ten years playing
uh
I mostly play either tekong
ya
ya
the thrill of competition
and then uh
gain my own confidence lah
primary eh
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
err that was like the our best performance
for the senior team lah
uh
uh and I also think that's important lah because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until uh finals
uh
oh
east zone is junyuan primary
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
uh is qihua qihua primary
and
either qihua or junyuan ah
but
ya junyuan is the east zone
champions ah power house
but
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like err even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like uh
personally I felt was possible lah but it it came down to my
my uh my team
that day first
first team
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
that was so it was
I I lost ah it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
uh if
if err one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
err we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
eh but ya
ya
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us lah
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
uh
it was a big accomplishment lah
but ya
okay
performance
mm
oh okay
okay
ya ya ya
is is a very big accomplishment lah
congratulate lor
which is demotivating ah
yup
yup
I think
ah that's why
no
so
no
okay lah uh so
ya together with someone
uh
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
uh
this overseas trip
uh it was a service learning trip lah
so
seven class
so
she's from err two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
uh
so we went to this overseas trip then
uh I tried to make friends ah then uh
one of them was her
mm
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that lah
and then uh
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then uh
during sec three
uh we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
it was just to me like a
ya ya
so
uh
late sec three
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer ah
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then ah
I think during N levels uh we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together lah
for what
to ask
uh
obviously I ask ah
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
uh
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me ah basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay uh I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that ah
but I still see a future lah is just
how things will work out
but ya
how about you
okay
but okay
mmhmm
ya

mm
mm because
and having a lot of money
or like when I want to buy something that I like
then the second one I think I want my own transport
oh best part is
but I since I already
the travel you know
ya then the third one
I want to have like
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
so what about you
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
talking about family gathering
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait lah for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
then
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no lah we put that aside first then we
chalet
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food lah
forever food and our transportation
like
share among us
book out already kan so okay lah
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
kan celebration also need more money
decoration need money also
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
party together like that
um you know that a
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ah
mm
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
ya lah marina is nice lah
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one uh one place where I know
outdoor pe
cause that time when I went uh to marina
uh I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there ah
so
we
parasol whatever lah
ah splash lah
like
but still like nice because
I think I think our cousin have I think ah I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still uh that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
oh
ya ya this one ah
mm nice we can go this kind
mm
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
they let us
mm
I not sure later after this we can google ah whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
mm
mm
mm
we confirm know we won't sleep what
oh nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle lah
mm
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate eh
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad ah
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade lah no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
whoa okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before ah but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
mm
what about glove
for rental lah
mm
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want ah
what if people really got like
pee on it or what eww but ya still ee okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
like
what's more that that you can do over there
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
mm
that's why I say but okay ah okay ah it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
mm mm mm
nice ya but
then the rock climbing indoor
ah zip line I I I don't think so hello inside the mall have zip line
when I was interning at kallang
but I feel shy
ya ya you need to pay I mean like obvious lah you need to pay but it's like
munch munch on snack or what
mm
ah ya lah can but
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
ah ya lah since we already book right we don't need to personally book in with our own body pe
no lah I mean we can just say what sorry excuse me this is my place I already booked this place uh then you can just ask them to go out lah
mm
so ya
but I'm gonna stay at the side
can what
but it's nice what it's like when you at the seaside
nice what it's such a good
uh memories
serious lah then after that
you
ya
you cook one I cook one
okay lah whatever lah nice whatever lah okay
and then we ask then
while waiting they
ask them to buy or whatever buy all the stuff all that
ya
mm
so that
oh I I don't think so ya
I mean it's gonna be only the two of us
mmhmm
ah so that's what you meant
no lah we just put at the same place lah
like I mean like the same kind
so
mm all the same so that
ya
ah ya ya ya nice what like that we can just throw after that
mm
mmhmm
eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
mm
sushi
kimbap that kind of thing we can do
because
but if not whatever
mushroom
mm mmhmm
since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food
they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
then we need one mineral water confirm
mm ah ya lah obvious
a'ah
mmhmm
ah ya lah
uh them to
as long as everyone can eat
mm
mmhmm
wait ah
mm
okay ah
ya okay lah not bad can
mmhmm
a'ah
orh
ah
what I mean is
mmhmm
so they will put everything inside only what
ah so I felt that it's more cleaner like that no
okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them lah
mm
mm mmhmm
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl
ya
so then after that
if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust
which is nice ah
then
sugar and butter together inside
melted butter
mushroom ball ah mushroom ball is nice
hmm
kan that's nice
mm
we going glamping yay
ya
ya like the normal picnic right ya
ya
mmhmm
but we tell them already what from from like
and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
uh if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
we're gonna spend a lot of money there
mm
mm okay ah nice
mm mm mm
mm
oh and I think we should have a
colour code
then we
ah
mmhmm
blue
ah okay ah nice
hmm
so
green
but no lah I felt like
okay what blue and green
pink
pink pink
ya lah nice what

I think our plan like nice already don't need to change
so later we make a whatsapp group right and then we talk about them we can just
uh tell all the plans from A to Z nice
but no black
huh
forbidden
okay ah nice nice

my family is good now my girl is going primary one then the other one is
four years old
ya a boy eh what about you ah
looking for someone ah
how old are you ah
haiya still got a long time to search for the uh for the right one lah
this weekend no plan what about you
who are these people do I know them
I see
oh is ahmad there
wah
cannot beat him lah
mm no not today lah because today I got some baking to do then I ask them to stay at my mum's place
can can maybe I can bring this weekend then you can try
maybe want to watch a movie and then we go picnic
oh that's true ah
but
you are bringing how many friends then maybe can come to my house
ya
can lah I don't mind then I can cook something for you guys and then we can just chill and then we can catch up
so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now
so I'm not so sure how is she going to cope
I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
hais
what do you think
ya but last time you don't have this stress now everything is about good marks good school hais stress lah
mm but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young eh you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher
ah but I think there are different rates for this
maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house lah I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you
eh so uh you wanna sit down somewhere like coffeeshop or something
where got atas you lah you work in what museum don't know what I not working eh
ya lah why
ya lah my
wait lah
ya
actually true lah because every time I fetch my kids ah then I see the maid like
just on their phone ah then never never even like take care of the kids some of them just allow the kids to run haiya crazy ah I don't know why this
these err their bosses ah never check on them
abuse
ya lah so
abuse what you mean by you abuse
so serious
orh you see lah I stay home so long ah never even read news hais I think I must start reading news to keep up myself
ya eh now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not ah
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
mm
mm
five days
so
oh
wah
hmm
mm
mm
uh huh
oh mm
stress at work
mm
ah
eh mm now got what exhibition over there
wow mm
but
mm
mm
mm
so a lot of people uh take leave
eh you redeem already
hmm
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
orh
mm
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go johor at least I make a bit more profit
mm
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya that's true lah eh you know about talking about government ah they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
ah then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
mm
mm
mm
kan the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
mm
mm
mm
mm but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country lah but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go um
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
mm
ya that's true
mm
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have um
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless lah
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily ah mm
mm
mm
wah eh you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
mm mm
okay
mm
ah
mm
hmm
oh
fifteen dollars per hour
mmhmm
hmm
expose lah
oh
mm
precautionary order at mm
housewife just like me
mm
mmhmm
they know better lah
mm
mm
mm
that's true
eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan
mmhmm
ya
mm prata
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
mm
ah okay eh that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
um
two prata
egg

and one what else ah just now you recommend what
ah maybe I take the prata coin instead lah
is the curry very nice
oh
ah okay lah then I take one set of that
can buy one plate for me
okay what are you eating
ah
mm
orh
oh
maybe I want one
teh peng
no teh with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
ah
okay lah then I take one mineral water
mm no I think that's all for now
orh
maybe this will take a bit more time ah
eh they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food
have you tried this
mm
okay so you ordering or I order
okay can I will just order point coin prata
briyani chicken fried one
and then water mineral water also for yourself mineral water
okay settled mineral water
okay so the food will arrive in

oh no they will send to us
ya so because there's table number indicate over here so I just write down our table number ya
mm mm
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ah
that's good
so mm
mmhmm
oh so how did you get to know about this like how do you volunteer is it through or because I don't see this anywhere
so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
mmhmm
oh
lah
mm
mm mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
mm mmhmm
mm
ya
mm
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use um handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of um our parents doesn't know how to use it lah
mmhmm
mm
though
mm
then
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I mean shiok lor
free lah to do whatever they want but of course within that eight person limit
mm
mm
ya
eh
oh
oh
mm
mm
oh social distancing ambassador
mm
uh huh
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm oh
mm ah
uh huh
mm

okay
especially during
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm ah
so ya and then like
okay lah they teach you a lot about like
ah regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
it's miserable lah everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
ah that's what I used to think lah because
when I when I became a recruit at tekong I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life ah
but honestly when
into inventory
is basically ah
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten ah
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then you are treated nicely what
no no
when I went to kranji camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
is like
even even though you are treated fairly ah but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
ah basically you are treated like
like less than human ah
then
but not as often
ya way better ah but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it ah all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
like I managed to go through it
ya
ya one year pass by what
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements ah is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
ah
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I
before I the twenty four not much
from the first day we move up from five
and we finish the next day at two working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
cannot even feel my own legs ah
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I uh
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
and then I I let them um try on my bag ah my full pack
hmm all ah
all of them
and then like oo no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay lah that is that is twenty four K that is so big ah
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
um
the send us out
to lim chu kang cemetery
at three three or two thirty
and then I was inside the bus looking out the window
I'm like oh my god S A F
who who who who who does things like these two come on and then is two until like
that same day eight we didn't even stop
ya and then at eight at night that is where they presented us our beret then like
wah shiok ah hmm
hmm
happy of course lah
if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp
it's like aircon imagine in jungle
and then like soft cushioned your your transitioning from laying down on the soil
err
uh is that bad you know one of my friend who
you know about tekong water
the our water doesn't come from new water it comes from a reservoir from tekong
and the water have err certain minerals that is good for you
is very nature lah and then it's straight from the reservoir to the water cooler
and it taste it taste like ugh it taste so bad
and then there's this one point where during the confinement week my buddy the toh
ah you don't know err military term toh that means ah basically you pass out ah or you just fall out ah some sort like that
during exercise no no he just wasn't feeling well and he passed out on the first parade
so he was sent out

it's like
because that plain water is so nice
and tekong isn't the duh eh ya

ah
brigade ah you say
like is a dog's life ah inventory is just a dog's life
is is expected everyone like suffer
you to ask is the
one of the worst vocation to be in ah
because like
they say it's a singaporean son experience ah
ya
and then once you finish
uh six november
two thousand twenty one is still a long way to go
oh ya ya ya
you want to know ah okay so basically
err I want to
basically I'm going to be jobless for the first six months ah
and then um

I I want to do a portfolio ah
like if you um
take my

the isn't isn't is not is
it's a future that is not promise to you
like if as if like you have a job when you have a job like all your promise like are going to get paid monthly just
you just follow orders and just do your your own stuff and then
but this one is like you are not confirm that you going to make it or not
so is very stressful
so it's like
it's like you're gambling you're gambling it away ah you gambling all your savings away ah
I like that's why I like trying to save up money for my after life
so ya
and I plan to also
compete
um
compete err
national like lah ah eh not national

a classic
classic bodybuilding ah
and then like
why why would should I wasted I have been training for ten years

so everyone know who I am
what
yes of course
a'ah
how long will it take
for me to get the physique I really wanted
assure already competitions like ah showed any physic
after you only I can build back by six months
because
there's such thing as muscle memories since I lost my muscle to
so it's like I can build back everything or even better in six months
so like
handsome ah
okay
okay
um
um ya
okay
hmm
oh damn
okay but
sorry what
err
okay lah some sort lah
okay
um
so basically your
home based business ah
okay
means okay lah singaporean pursuit what
hmm
will I am black eyes peas
ah
will progress ah
ah
so if you are successful in your selling of clothes
hmm
no no no no no what I mean is
if your business is like a daily product progressively successful right
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm um
there will be any other platform that will take over what
ya but right now like facebook is killing it ah
like but there will be a day where facebook will die out and then other social media social media platform that will take over
tiktok tiktok
oh but no no I never use tiktok ah to me
ya
alah
why
ah but
the funny right is like
two out of ten eh
so is like two of them
or one sometimes is one one of them is funny and then another nine of them right you keep pressing
the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up lah sorry lah that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about err
like photography and photoshop
so basically err after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
err like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality ah
so it's like I get like followers ah
err it's like honestly eh
what I heard from my member as duh
come forward to tell like eh I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
ya ya
ya is like very popular
gym shark
hmm mm
ya lah yoga pants lah oo what lah shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and hey bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different ah
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those ah
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
and then like so it's look like really good ah that's why I also want to buy new phone
eh S twenty is good ah
oh no to me
technology now kan
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
so technology right now is like
is good ah how is progressing ah
ya ya mm S twenty plus ah
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone ah I bet you like taking photos right
mm
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
no just ask them any camera phones that
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game ah
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality lah
ya
oh
um mm
okay
okay eh but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want
this olympic athlete he is the
ya
kan
oh ya ya like if you have like like a premium
collection or what kan
there's like one clothes is like sixty dollars
then the shipping price is like worth it
can you imagine if the shipping price is higher than the actual dress people like huh why would I do that
why would I do that
okay
okay
okay
but
that means you need good lighting is not the camera
okay
don't use V S C O it's not good use photoshop
okay
mm
troublesome ah
photoshop you can get it for free
over time you'll get so good at it that you don't have to even think
mm
photoshop no lah you need you need that's why I told you is practice you ask a person let say into photography you ask ah
can you edit a
can you put my ear on my forehead
serious you just need practice
um
ya lah
I used to use photoshop ah once you know like how to do it
it's okay lah it's just arrange and repeat
okay okay lah then mm ya of course
mm
body shop eh
okay
ya is
what's going to be ah huh I can't wait I'm left with like one more year
oh man I can't wait
because after that I will finish my tech
you know you know wis a tech
a tech is basically the final exam so basically
um we go to war
with another company
the full of the company full of food just regulars like regular sign on
men
and
their life really
so is like you're fighting against people that really know the jungle
so ya and high chance that you will die
so and is quite quite long lah but what I heard is that whenever they say paradise now right
after like a tech right you know what's a paradise now
it means mission complete so when they say paradise now means
ah then you're done already ah
it's now it's paradise you have nothing to worry about them
the last two months of your right
should be everyday
what I heard is
you booking
on sunday
um like midnight I think I hopefully ah
and then I woke up the next day at three
so basically I
I'm staying overnight ah
mm
ya that's basically our job alah
like thirty percent of is also is becoming a cleaner
I'm not kidding
is
you know there's there's no cleaner in a camp
we are the cleaners
there's no cleaner at all
um except for canteen
we clean it
some sort like specialised thorough cleaning
where soldiers are we not like ah
they don't hire us specially for
but we have always to clean toilet ah every week
every week clean toilet clean bunk clean corridor clean gym
clean clean lamp clean parade square
mm
you you have to clean oh kitchen what right
mm
mm
your practical practical kan
of course lah is
your
I bet there would be
labelled for doing certain things like for example
like um in camp
we have one idiot
mm
okay
um
ya lah you what secondary school eh
college
mm
mm
mm
okay
okay
confirm you the most irritating one I bet
shy one
mm
wah
luckily you're not in army sia
because they have things like this
like um like my position is like I'm
second in charge in for company eh no no
uh platoon six
so basically I'm some sort like under the
is like you have to do jobs like as you
you are a sergeant
and then
everytime before we move out for a mission
they have like a briefing briefing room only two will be there
so basically our commanders will give us what to do how to attack everything
like they they draw on the whiteboard
and then
after that we go back to our what section
and then we'll build them
um
I no
I wanted to be I wanted to be a commander not a two
I wanted to lead because of the pay
right now I lead I have the same pay as a trooper
okay okay
hmm
mm
ya lah
I know
depends on the depends on your bully
depends on to what extent
and then
when because
everytime everytime like
whenever he's he's trying to chase a girl
he will put on this like this personality
like okay there's this one time
wah he says skater
that's because he wants to impress someone
so funny like what
is is like ah
like I really miss my life ah
um what do you mean which one li only have one life ya
oh two campus ah no but I love my life ah choa chu kang
that that one you ah cannot blame your stupidity lah
because you you don't want to said it like I live at choa chu kang then I go back to balestier when there's a choa chu kang campus there ya lah
so I agree lah you agree to my statement ah thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
oo but college central is such a big school eh
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
err my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
um
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then yay recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life lah
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly ah it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time lah outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something lah
that I can
work lah but
honestly I don't want to ah I don't want to be electrical engineer
eh in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold schwarzenegger at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
wah
there's a lot of foreign talent
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
oh ya ya
um ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
um
P P
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
mm
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school eh let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
um ya
singapore is quite messed up ah
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
you see ah
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
um
ya ya
but okay lah what
I think like
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
stone aged stone aged ah like indonesia
ya ya ya eh

ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty

at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
mm
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week ah fourth month uh fourth week

since I last went back and
um when back and you know met my see my cats and just do weekend grocery shopping
ya so it's
when uh when was last time you travelled
they are locals they are local students
all all these
all these you're talking about your trip ah in korea to korea
mmhmm
mm
okay for me I went to korea as well the last time
it was
last
mm
no
so I was there uh I went with my friend on a night
um
so
we had a actually quite
the flight experience was
okay for me this one my first night flight
but
cause
this time round was with Korean Air
so I didn't really I didn't really enjoy my flight lah
ah
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm
okay we didn't want to spend too much lah on
flight
cause when we were when we're going to be in korea for eleven days
so
it's more of like what we gonna spend over there
not so much of the flight
so
so what did I
hotel
Airbnb
ya
okay
I tell you my journey lah kan
so we were very happy that it's convenient
very excited
not to the lobby lah
so we we put uh we key in the pin code and then we saw flight of stairs
are you kidding me I'm not uh I
I'm I don't I don't want what
what what I I don't want to
bring my luggage up lah you know
it was it was like err
but we had no choice we had to do lah
key in key
the first thing we saw was a puppy it was a dead uh it was it was a puppy it was a toy
and send and send to the owner
it was a doll
mm
you get what I mean or not
dhira do you know what I mean or not
ya
so it's actually a toy it's actually a
what do you call that
uh not not really not not statue lah it's like
what ah um
no no no no no
ya it's more of a decoration piece just to add in to the apartment
ya
so we actually okay
so what we did was we actually booked one night
so instead of booking ten nights we actually booked eleven nights
just so that we don't have to wait until the
the check in time at three
so that's what we did lah
how how ya
mm
mm mm
mm
check in
mm
mm
ya so
we in order for us to move in
we had to book one night at the okay one night before so that
the nobody can book and then we can have that room like so technically it's like
we check in late lah right
we check in late but we just paid we paid the extra
one twelve forty dollars
cause it's forty dollars per forty five dollars per night
mm
I stayed at dongdaemun
ya
mm
for me um
during my time eleven days there lah right uh what
makes it um okay cause I went there for trip so it was just me and my friend
just the two of us
err initially we wanted to go
to the other part of korea like daegu and busan
but we decided to um decided not to lah
so we just stayed for
mm we didn't okay wait we didn't really okay now I'm with I'm trying to recall I think out of the eleven days only the first seven days we actually did quite a lot of things the other four days is just like lazing around lazing around uh and
more like own time own target
when we feel like going out we go out if not then we just
eat Maggi in the in the room
cause we just want to get the korea air
mm
planetarium
mm so it wasn't a skiing period lah
it was like spring I think
ya it's spring
ya it's spring
the only thing that okay
it was crowded
so our main objective um
was to go around to all the hot spots
to take photos um
and just chill
like their people that like their locals
so we went to so we went to hongdae myeong-dong all those typical place lah
mm
no that was my graduation trip so before before before I went korea okay okay I okay to be honest right last last year
last year was
um the best I think was the best like
one of the best year of my life like one of the best year
march I was in I went to japan for a family trip with my uh for family trip so I only came back for one week
before I travelled to korea with my friend for for trip
so I actually went so actually went to japan and korea
uh one for family trip and then one for
err
one for um trip with my friend
um
mmhmm
okay for me um cause I just started cause I just started the good thing is that um
I went to okay I
how do I say this
okay I enrolled in I enrol in together with my friend who I went for trip to korea last year
so technically we will graduate we will graduate at the same time
at the same time
so ya maybe if
so maybe if we have we do not we don't have more we don't have
much commitment uh I wouldn't mind planning for a trip with her
but honestly I feel like going to switzerland
but it's so expensive lah aiyo
for me it's actually the scenery
not much so much of
cause when I travel I don't I don't like to shop actually
ya
okay and to be honest I don't mind going back to korea even though okay I've been to korea
the experience uh were all different so I went
the third time was with my friend so these three actually gave me a different these three actually gave me a different experience but out of these three actually the last experience
very bad like very very bad experience okay the thing is right maybe cause
my friend and I
we look like koreans
so we were like treated like locals like people were like rude to us
ya
um
travel to krabi in june
so we supposed to travel in june cause
I was supposed okay I was supposed not I was supposed lah
like freedom to travel so we planned for like a five
five five days four nights to krabi so we had all like we create a WhatsApp group of all the cousins going blah blah blah blah blah
and then got cancelled
cause of COVID
so
even though I entitled for eighteen days leave I end up using my leave
for exams
uh yes
uh for the first time it's actually unlimited
is still part of singapore
is it part of singapore so you need to take ferry lah aiyo need to take a ferry that that's what makes it different lah but let
oh okay speaking of pulau ubin uh recently actually okay we had we had uh group uh like
all the cousins right
we have group with all the cousins right
it's a legit group
I didn't enrol in that camp but sister did lah
my my sister did
so but none of my cousins okay the cousins that were supposed to go krabi all of us have never been to pulau ubin so we wanted to go to pulau ubin
like last
like
last month
so we cancelled that
so to be honest the group the WhatsApp group name keep changing
no
I'm sleeping I'm sleeping alone
shut up
loyang still exist ah
I can't remember the last time I actually went to chalet
civil defence or civil servant
orh
mm
okay no wait now you're talking about horror story
okay ah just nice before COVID the same group of cousins who actually planned for krabi
okay okay how this group started kan
it's was cause we we
we planned for all
okay I have a very big family so the girls that are not married
female like the close one that are not married yet
uh five of us
okay so
uh five of us lah
so in
so there were five of us
my sister me my three of my cousins lah so we planned and then we stayed in a hotel a quite famous hotel
so we okay so they were insist they insisted
to
take bus
I don't want to take bus
I I hate long bus ride
I prefer honestly I prefer like uh
bus
more expensive one type more expensive ones so it was quite comfortable ya so it was quite comfortable
so that's not the point the point was
we reached the hotel at five
five and all of us are like half awake
so reached the hotel lobby and then we checked in as usual cause we did ask we did request for early check in cause one thing about our there's one thing about me and my family we don't like to waste time
we don't like to wait we we just would rather just pay extra to just like check in early whatever lah
so reached the hotel the hotel lobby
um
uh one one one one of the one of the famous hotel in that has a shopping mall
so
cause there were five of us so we take the suite
the okay that that was not the first time uh I stayed there
it was the second time actually the first time was with my family lah
so it's technically a a door like
door within a door you get what I mean
okay on the okay so on the next next okay the door next to our room
is the emergency exit
so when you walk a little bit more uh it's the kitchen the big living room with the dining
with dining
inside that living room next to the dining is another room with a king-sized bed that that that that's my cousin's room
so we have two toilets lah
okay the thing is that right when you when we went in uh cause we were all very sleepy already
so we just take our spot we didn't even bother to like
err
give any comments we only shared our experiences when we reached singapore and it's not like the next day after one week and we actually heard it from
our mothers like like I told my mum
ah they told their they told their my aunt
so actually my mum and my aunt shared our stories then we we went back to the WhatsApp group and like
oh my god you experience you experience this
I experience this also
then after that we meet and then we shared the story like it's funny that
all of us experienced different things but we only decided to share that thing when we in singapore
okay so
my there there were five of us so
uh my sister and I took the first room
so my cousin insisted that she wants an extra bed
so we so we called and all these we we called and then they said that uh oh um the bed is hundred fifty per night and all this lah
ya but
so so we were like okay lah we didn't think much then like just heard the biggest the bigger sister took the sofa and then we all just went to bed and then at twelve and then at twelve and then at twelve when we wanted to go for lunch
then my cousin brought it up again I want to get an extra bed
so everybody sleep in the room together
ya the same cousin that okay one of the younger one lah
so she she insisted she wanted to get extra bed
so we were like why why is she so persistent then my my sister my sister my sister offered
uh no okay wait no babe the story has not ended
so uh when my sister offered
she she was still very persistent my cousin was still very persistent no no no no everybody sleep in the room
so
at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
together
so we actually brought the entire uh we moved the entire bed uh all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
we thought of like uh let let's go get bath bombs
uh
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
no
um
after that is the bathtub
um the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too lah so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money lah I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
uh that okay that was the second night when we decided to um buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and uh my grandma
yes
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
ah
but
we didn't think much lah cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me um what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something lah
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
um
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say um
ya
when my mum called her sister then
mmhmm
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
uh another bed
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
um this this kind of thing ah ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
um she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually uh on the left
um
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
um dusty
nothing else um was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall one the room was dusty lah
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think uh occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
um in our heart lah we're like
uh this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause uh it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed ah
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins uh she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins ah
so my cousin said uh
best lah
uh it was fun
but we had uh
we had experiences
uh in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
oh
yes
so they did that um
so so the moment she know what that she uh quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google lah
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
uh
the first time
was with my family
but that one we actually uh my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room ah during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just uh king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the uh
front room lah
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
oh only sixteen twenty
that uh definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel seh
corner corner
okay the the floor
so the the the hotel very big right
uh the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
uh
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like um kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
uh we couldn't be bothered lah cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
uh
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work ah we we we like err don't want ah we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to krabi if not cause of this COVID
ah it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us uh
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were uh
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think lah
eh ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal one
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
err given a choice I won't want to go back there
ah
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
ah recite recital and
the laundry room
no while waiting for laundry

so how's your secondary school life
introvert ah
studying
in secondary school especially in my
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
that's when N levels I did well
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong ah
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
oh
oh
oh
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head lah I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
ya
ya
they love it too much lah they think you can they can
you can hold on to you ah
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
burger king
mm
I basically after N levels
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
I work there and it was a good experience lah it was a good two months
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
don't have the same uh mentality as us
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
so it's a tough time ah for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
ya
after staff day nope
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's what
the group mah
mm
okay that was that was fast
like photographer ah
oh
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
how to say eh
my opinion ah
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
you apply yourself
they would expect you to know how to do and all
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
because it's the top few ah from what I know lah from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
so I just follow the flow
then ya lah I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
mm
to make it as your career
mm
correct agree
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore lah
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan ah
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down lah
ya
yup but honestly
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
that's how much I love bio last time
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
annoying
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
mm
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun lah I mean
I I watch a lot of ah boys to men ah so I find the navy part the best ah
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
got highly likely lah
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to ah
special operations command
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and uh
ah firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life hor
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first leh
will definitely be will definitely glow up lah after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
I don't think got chance ah
intelligence
talk eh
four hours
quick maths ah
okay
it was okay
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma lah there's normally
consider
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
okay
it's kinda cool though
mm
primary school
mm
is like our one of our longest ah
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be ah
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
wrestling
so I really look up to them ah
so I like their character ah
ya that was that was fun days ah
do you do parkour in school it's like normal lah primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak ah
yes
mm
mm
okay
oh
so you have been leading all the way lah you have been leading the lines lah
discipline
mm
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
tekong the left side is striker
oh
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
they were national team player ah after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
junyuan tampines located around tampines kan
junyuan
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus lah
pressure lah
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
you never go this far lah
woo amazing story
I don't really have much luck lah
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
you will always be blamed
to our highest position that we ever got
in gan eng seng secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us err err the
the the drop dead centre lah
then when I go so basically no luck lah I go delta league also I play under my school name
uh and that one second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
for a prize
then when I goes poly
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me lah it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
like
go down ah
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
um this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
they they appointed me as captain and
and I look at how rich our history
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
ya so I guess
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
you
you will not succeed
you know
at least something know
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey lah how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
because to see change you also have to change
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya lah it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further lah
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
mm love life
okay
oh
like candy sia nothing serious
orh
good one good one right right
went out more often then
then who who had the courage
to go first
to ask
oh you ask
and she's a nice woman
how do you cope with it okay
I think it's now close to an hour I purposely ask you that question so that we can end it on a high
more even though I know you already
but ya we we we open up more

yes
what was just now your meet up
oh
what cancer
huh
then oo gold bar
oh
as in he has a store
what was he doing before that
oh
oh
mm
I had no idea so you guys went all the way there
where there's the near the sultan there
mm
so gone lah
where you put aside place
should have just worn an apron or what
like a bib
mm
ya but
you just have to wear white right
then the other guy shah
mm
mm
the one that pass away is
the child passed away wasn't it ariza also
oh okay okay

ah
mm
but if I'm the person I'll just ask for higher pay ah
mm
mm hmm
it's good lah on the resume
because she thinks she's new mm
ya I think just rise up to the occasion
know that's the thing never talk about such things in the toilet lah
but toilet is like you never know who's in the cubicle what
um
but that painting thing is like I don't know whether the kids will like it it's like for older ones ah

mm

you get I mean that long compartment under the the study desk
I was like oh then I went to it still there but it's still in good condition
oh ya ya ya can sell ah
mm
he never uses what
ya he should wear the black shoes and get rid of the Nike if the Nike if the Nike is tight
ya he should decide he should really ilya also has like a few shoes
shoes is you
what super low ball
wah even thirty also cannot pull
forget it lah
you bought it how much and you want to sell so low
why don't you wear it then while waiting for people to buy
ya but half size is so big meh
ya but you didn't have this is japanese brand you didn't even try
usually what I do is I will give all the sizes then they know from there
it is recording
mm half
err like that lah you know lah
like I when I buy the shoes for the kids right
I bring that thing lah
ya at least you can see the sole you you know nothing beats like really measuring
yup
like even my
just that singapore don't have that
soccer boots
why you want to sell it
oh the boots that you wanna giveaway

but you didn't really wear it right
how much did you buy it for
eh how can you buy second hand
from isn't it
mm
why ah
you really
you really fix your boot
why I was asking ilya then when I
he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no lah didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset what like last time also holiday is like finish up the
um
assessment book that kind but the thing is right um
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like um
uh
oh like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like hey I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like huh maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
okay okay and uh
that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus
ya ya ya that kind of thing
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently lah formally but
to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay
huh
huh got such thing ah
ya
the only time I went there is the scholarship lah but
it's so far
um
ah ya did you go for it

err cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
tabata but not tabata
but there's a lot of variation in different different
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not

twenty five thirty five minutes total
err yes it's
err okay let's play a game to the listeners
err
our shirt is green in colour
guess
err
okay err like share and subscribe and put it down in the comments below on what you think our
oh is it distracting
no lah it's not
err is it from what you see
no lah it's okay eh why you why you my ear ah
oh you to me wah
constricct constricted or is it restricted
constricted
constricted constrict
restricted
cause okay lah
limited limited edition
okay so what are you what's your plans tomorrow how about that
mm
okay
same until I got C for my malay
no for my H one also I got c
ah
h one C eh
I hope it's accepted to actually talk like this but I think so eh because it's they say is to to talk normally
mahadhir
oh ikmal
wow
ah just saying it's recorded again
okay um
um eh but actually you know I was thinking kan actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line kan
kan you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
err
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if lah I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting lah
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
ya
ya okay
hmm
mm
ah
ah
okay
mm ya ah
ah okay I
err
saying it to the people listening to this err we are currently students and if you have any err
part
ah
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
I was cutting you so
oh twenty seven more minutes
eh that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from eh
just gone
statistics eh
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
I told cause I
err maybe bell curve also lah
no lah but actually is is is helpful for those that
err don't do well eh wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
actually it doesn't help hor
you just fail
oh ya actually he's true ah
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this eh
no nobody can see your forehead
okay ah just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
um
maybe five metres
overhead eh no overhead bridge is four point eight metres oh four point five ah
oh you want to take
class three ya err
okay lah
ah I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips ah
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
that place let's call it um
eh I took my err I would say I took as school students so not private lah
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
err
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard err they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
but I would say the no lah not my age lah
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
I just pick the cheapest lesson lah so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
mm you think you are correct or not
you think
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
ya some more I I was so pissed lah but then
I think at that point I was just still
yes
so the first two times
err it was last year twenty fourth december err because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
err my test and then
err it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
err
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard sharul ya and then I heard sharul ya this year then I heard sharul pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
and then I was
ya then some more
err during my
so my test was err example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this err I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he
he took a break for a few years then he come back no I I didn't compare lah it just that
ya but then now now that I already have license and

if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be

mm
good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
hmm
okay so good looks ah
K good looks
ya lah I want to ask now lah so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya lah something like etol lah you cannot say that he has good looks what
siala
I told you I didn't want that
I told you what
there's a possibility that
um
mm
mm
I would prefer
oh okay okay uh good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K lah I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask what
okay err
the the ugly ah
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like aman
okay err
mm
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
err
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya sia like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
eh then nevermind lah they can be bubbles and more what
why socks

the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat

but okay lah at least we tried ah
cause I don't know ah I want to release this fast lah this year I want to try to release all the best ambling with lah
err yes
ya that's why
that's why
I think he he he manages to save some before that then at least during going to the phase of the wedding he doesn't really struggle lor
like struggle so much lor if not wah walao eh if you always like you push away everything right then you just want to focus on that marriage marriage or wedding ah
it's a wedding
yes
correct is focusing on the wedding instead of you focus on the marriage cause if you don't know leh like you spend so much so much on
one day and then you struggle for so many months for that one day ah walao eh
money in your then
then plan plan plan plan plan after five years can sell you upgrade ah
ah actually true
very small sia
err true same cause three resale three room bigger sia
like you more spacious old lah old a bit but then at least spacious you got space you can like
err true
wal house small err mamat house also quite small
same same as wal house yes same
err
but also ya lah I think
zafran house big
correct earlier that one big his house big like other other people house like all very small ah like hud house also actually quite small eh
correct correct correct yadi house more cramp lah
cause I think he put a lot of things inside but I don't know lah but I don't know come back to sial
hopefully you guys get to tour lah next year at least next year lah
cause I think their wedding is september eh
kan
who
this october
wow
wow ya ya it's about time lah she also needs to settle down lah
ah she is I think she's good at managing time also ah ah I think she very disciplined ya but that's good lah at least she want to get married lah
ya at sofitel kan
part-time part-time cause I got see her on instagram then I ask where she working now ah then she say
where she get job lah cause I think she got laid off at the previous place ah
ya outram or tanjong pagar that one then after that then she say she get another job lah but good for her lah at least she but she knows how to manage lah she she say actually good with time and management lah that's why she can handle the
the rental that's the good part ah
so in a way he bo pian ah he come down ah
I mean just their style lah so so he bo pian ah he bo pian he like err so I text him like eh you jamming ah huh
ya true
oh beat a
okay lah but at least you guys went tour already sia
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
musically very strong ah
ya
ah
ah that's good
those dark waves
with little cost ah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
ya
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours eh is also to me an opener ah it's still fun ah it's still fun ah I mean as following tour ah so
yes
ya lah
but then again also I think it's not also about touring ah I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring ah you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe ah then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
mm mm
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared sia
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person ah
but ah lal recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs ah one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas lah lyric lyric wise would be dol lah cause his lyrics are actually very good
hakim fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
ah skate punk like a lot of
hakim is very propagandhi
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part ah
confirm blast kan
oh oh farhan eh
but but
ah ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel lah you can also hear that is double ah like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know ah is their style ah
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song ah that kind of vibe ah but then
ah ya ya
ya relevant bands ah
they they they they suck life ah or they suck ah actually personally I don't listen to them already ah like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound ah cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
err still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album what
last year ah not bad lah but still the same sound ah
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya ah professor professor sia vocalist professor siol sia
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene ah they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like err surfers and skateboarders mah
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets ah but they are very intelligent people ah
tony hawk pro skater eh
no I don't like him ah
but cannot ah
but okay lah see how lah missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause wan G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
ah I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape one then he just need to redo the everything ah so he give to hakim hakim
maggot maggot ah maggot setting up for him ah then he gonna after that we jam ah
composer
all of us ah together but wan G is the one that do everything lah so
yes err so we input ideas lah ah like but but wan G will will wan G will do first lah at home then after that after he do
I don't know he ah to me it's okay lah
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something lah and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said eh
err better ah
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound eh I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast ah cause we delay too long already ah ah so we we we say never mind lah we we we told hakim next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you ah but because we already comfortable eh and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff lah
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like ah ah recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
ah bass man ah it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky ah I think I think he's damn lucky ah like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band lah
so far his recordings are actually good ah his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good ah for me lah personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient yadi is lah
cause must commit correct must commit
cause hakim is very hardworking that is his his income pe his livelihood pe
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands lah but from what
sia
no no no he he got another reggae band
err
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer ah ya ya ya rizal
so I think recorded there also
err even stoned revivals ah remix sound that song oh no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it err make it into malay also err I think goodil eh
ya lah but how they do it right is like err err
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia esam esam australia esam will record
err we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here ah
ya but it also depends on him what he I don't know but
don't know ah but
I I don't know ah but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay lah I think zad also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good ah
youtube siao he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out ah into it ah
yes correct
but then see lah maybe maybe in future lah maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest ah but one thing about zad I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good sia cause he feels paiseh lah want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use lah I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks lah cause it's a wear and tear
ah
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable what it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay lah I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
ah we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him lah if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever lah run everything if ah confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury lah so then
at least you know before to record we come here lah we help you to shift the whatever lah amp
ya shift the mic lah whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential sia
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
err cause of what you produce ah
so we'll see lah
don't know lah
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
err so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya lah
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right zad was okay zad wanted to do it he injured what
ah
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental ah mental ah it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend what then then we just walk ah so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to punggol end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk ah
ah but azil also said never mind ah we take it slow ah don't don't
don't force yourself lah you know then to give up also now is like wasted sia ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself ah
twenty minutes half an hour after that aisyah like okay ah then we all like come lah let's go ah hafiz waiting
ah ah
so we had to walk for one plus click ah
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
so that was the slowest walk to punggol err settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
ah
siao
ah ah
oh there the park connector ah
go to coastal
east coast
it's wrong coastal the coastal tanah merah coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
ya so ya lah but don't know ah but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard ah
so ya lah but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
whatever we can cut we cut ah no lah but
yio chu kang sengkang cannot ah must go that way no actually right
oh cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the buangkok is the nearest to reach ah but that one is also quite a stretch ah
ah ah but but is like you walk walk eh park connector park connector then you see eh sengkang already
the other end then you go in front another bridge oh that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of sengkang
then you go to punggol so that from punggol the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay ah this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just sumang
so that sumang is the end the beginning of that sumang is like the end middle of punggol lah that sumang
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
so there's another route ah so there's another route to walk
but we see lah we try again ah
we see next time maybe end of the year lah okay lah K K K

ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay what is it
ya
oh
so this will be your third wish lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like uh
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich what
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for um
is benefit for myself and my family lah
so we can bring whole family go shopping together ha
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere lah
when you got a big family right it's much easier
ah rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen uh we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood lah eh if anybody
ah emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
ah so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money ha
everything about money lah eh
because although once you being rich you still think about money ah that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
uh stable financial eh
ride their own bicycle to school ah kan
so from there also safe you see everything think about money eh
I already think very far lah kan
ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
then after that
ah you say that you read about the news kan
ah but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay lah not bad lah
so why not then
so at least if we can use that uh one hundred uh dollar voucher lah
we can save up money save up some money lah
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
mm
uh huh
mmhmm
ya correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
um you know that uh
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
ah they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you lah
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest uh maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso kan
mm so like that better right
mm
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
err
ya lah marina is nice ah
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
splash
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think that one is quite cheap also
because um that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this lah
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
ah
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
ah so maybe we can go for that one ah
mm so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you ah so we no need to go for separate rooms what
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk ah
cannot gathering ah cannot make side illegal gathering
ah cannot gossip ah
so at least at least lah mm so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
have lah
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle ah I not sure
but they can uh ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride ha
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part lah that we can do
ah
maybe we can plan saturday morning
mm no maybe afternoon
oh ya because actually we don't want
um
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
mmhmm
the next morning we go cycling
oh over there if I not wrong got burger king eh
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin ah
ya that's why
but I think uh over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure ah
hmm maybe we can search everything
um
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
mmhmm mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I don't like to roller blade lah actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see seh don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay lah nevermind lah
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
alah huh
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it lah
like that lor
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct lah it's boring lah because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
ya very very cold
mmhmm ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
wah we die
mmhmm
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I aiyo if I go there eh
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly ah if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious ah they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya lah I think um
will love it okay will love it
the one that is suggest just now
it's a nice view lah
ya
not bad right
we really don't have enough time for each other also
but got zipline or not
oh ya kallang right
rock climbing right oh ya ya ya
ya that's why but if I not wrong need to pay you know
I know
if I not wrong have
maybe we can buy some snack ah
but you know like this kind of
always have uh family gathering kan
mm
they
ya but you need to book also you know
a'ah
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside alamak inside your tent

hmm
mmhmm

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
so at least we can save lah save a bit
like over there mm

but I think this is already nice planning ah
that's why
but make sure lah this time round happen lah eh

um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

um so how is school these days
ya true
october
you know
um
then
sarah also oh
me and nashrul all meet ah
cause sarah also busy with her
but
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but um now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so um
when your exam start bro
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
for me like for example eh
um I would consider ah because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
exhausting ah like what I see that's why I really
then for me also like my results it's um released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also eh will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like um because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
so like
maths jer for that day so like after that day they will like grade us oh how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want lah of course my expectation is higher
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
then
so like
um
it's okay
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them oh what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure um and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise kan and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me lah then my daily grade from
like it's important subject lah
so ya um
then
for sure but um for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable lah
teacher will give us like uh practice questions to do
eh eleven five nine
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time um
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to um type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before um eh like when you presenting and all
then um for me kan like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
whatever I say kan confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya um
ya
and then
also ya
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
ours
is different seh we like on that day kan the presentation on that day you have to ah prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break lah kan
ya
mm
and it was uh two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
ya
mm
mm no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
eh but for her kan NAFA
really
oh
eh wow I didn't know that
oh my god that's so much friends
seriously
ya
for sure
I'm proud of myself like wow
ya same
same lah as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see um every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
um gone
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family kan is like

okay
I think you can start the conversation
hello
so let's begin our conversation
what about you
oh ya
today
so basically just now I went for meeting for the final meeting for my for my commission project
satisfying
no lah I mean
for my first time commission project for my first ever commission project not firstly lah first time lah
consider
well I mean they are willing to pay me two hundred
almost three hundred because I
actually order her modern dress
she lost weight
ya so actually I that was supposed to be the only fitting
but turns out
but turns out she lost weight so I had to do alteration
her her arm pull drop
yes she lost five
she lost five I gain more I gain more than that she lost five
I get
she don't like it or is too much
ya
the things is the part right
the part is okay but with the waistband the arm hold
trying to find the fit
just ya the jumping part I'm bad at that
but okay lah
no that's like ruffle
yes
I don't know maybe is my drafting is wrong
like the curve of the arm hold shouldn't be too curvy
but I think my one is sharp
it was supposed to be like right ya I think mine is
very high
you know when I is like I sew
I didn't actually follow the entire thing
I just dug in
so you still the
yes
you seen esah's engagement right

I wish you she want something
the
you know those floral crop top like lace

how did it go
the zoom is about

and you haven't start
hmm one month
or is it prorated
so the cut off date is eh there's no cut off date is not is a full time pay right
but that you only get paid mid of the next month
ya
this is like my workplace the full timers get paid mid month no twenty twentieth every twentieth of the month they get paid
my one for temporary is only end of the month they actually not ended end of the month
is not even end of the month is seventh of the next month
what
what is actually right there is no cut off date some more so it it's look like you're working
forty days
but you get paid can already
but most of my bills will be end of the month my phone bill
oh gym
still ah anytime fitness
F forty five
oh Fitness First
best
ya
what
I also don't understand clementi is
uh huh
huh what is all these polis
oo okay
is it like walking distance
oh
office
ya is because like now you don't have
you know err a proper working schedule
so you can go any during the non peak hour period
okay that is cheap
for one month
no lah like how did
oh is cute
huh
not one three six anymore
so everytime they will change the
cost of the

like the promo will not end lah
mmhmm
oh
but you are paying the insurance no
so that is equal
like one fifty lah roughly
ya because is cheapest deal
hmm
but how do you know like whether you are doing the right form
oo
oh ya
but have you ever thought of joining F forty five
you were from F forty five what usually when you go to work no meh
you were still working there
during the F forty five trial
you were still working with us right
yes I remember
yes
it was
mm
but after that you never continue your F forty five
and lesson oh ya
I want to try sia
yes
except for you
ah
mm
ya
you mean by reps ha
oh my god
I know one of the one of my senior from poly
but
what I know now she is working at
F forty five as a trainer which is shocking
mmhmm
she's fit but
again she begin without any experience from fitness
then
no don't have she she was just a freelancer for graphic design
then now she's a trainer
if you see right
all her videos her
story
she will be training at the gym itself
at the studio at F forty five studio
and she improve a lot sia
east
serious are you are you serious right or are you joking
but gym trainer I I mean the receptionist
sure
yes
maybe after closing ah
after closing you just close the gym and then you can have the gym to yourself and no training that's all
yes is not the receptionist job hey got a cleaner for a reason
barry barry what's that
B A
woo
oh okay wow
they all so fit
khai friend what happened
as a receptionist
okay what is he doing now
khai
why
mmhmm
oh okay okay okay
what
mm
he bailed
okay
ya
hmm
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
oh my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
oh is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract lah
then it's okay ah
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
huh
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really meh okay lah my first
but not admin
no pay lah like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he zao
wasted sia
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
ah I
last september
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for uh for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of err end of september
the end of september
seven or eight october
then uh when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her lah luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said oh is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this one she just disappear
ya
I mean come on lah I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about uh our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said oh my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said oh the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking lah
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay ah
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K what so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine leh
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
changi
yes ah
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
so of course lah I understand why she is angry lor then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more eh four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four eh one point six ah one point ya ya
ask maybe
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know lah like try your luck lah then she said
no lah but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
kan
cannot lah sia I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
sad sia
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy eh
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission lah but still we are still doing our job
actually their their pay is is good leh for full timer
two point six
email lah I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay ah
yes and is not only that sia
the big boss will be
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave mah I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck ah I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I zao already lah
good right don't need lah for what
come back for what said goodbye
I don't have pass
is just uniform I can give them on my last day all clean ya
I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know lah
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
but it's more like I design for him a collection he wants to come out a clothing brand
so ya but he wants me to
right
he wants me to design but he wants me to come out with the brand and and take it as my brand under his wing
the whole collection okay
is not my brand I don't is like louis vuitton
yes that's a beauty director but there's still a designer for the fit right yes and staff like that so I told him that way then he he he finally agree to it then he said okay lah we see how we start out with one collection first
so then when I take over it I cannot work with raki anymore I don't know whether he confirm or not because there's no there's no update
but yup
ya after this job ah then I can focus because I still got another one more commission project not commission lah is more like I do it as

that's all I can think of ah
err shape of the mango eh um I think it's um
um
um
I think that mango is just rare lah in singapore too if they sell
oh why is it my favorite food um
um
um
the type the types of mango that ah my
the types of mango my ah my brother
I like I don't know how to describe but just mango is just my favorite lah
mango kan and it's a fruit
perfect
and also it's also and it's also healthy
like my brother said um
ya it ya it's sunshine
shine your day you know like brightens your day up you know when you eat mango
so um
you know
oh um
so um other than that um I
other than that
err
like
I don't know eh like um
mango is just
mango is just everything ah to me like
um
you can just
you know like make juice you can make a cake you can make a puff
you can make everything with mango because mango is just
amazing
pudding right
they
ya they they process like syrup for us to you know to
to drink as a
just for an everyday drink you know
because mango just
you can do whatever you want with mango
like literally anything you want with mango because
mango is just like you know
we can't talk much about mango because
like what my brother said everyday everyday we eat mango
we
we like
rarely talk about it you know
uh this topic came out from my brother
don't know how to talk about mango because mango is just so many things um so many things to talk about so
like
you know it's all stuck inside our heads like we cannot think of it but then
you know it's just mango
of course not
but we can make it you know
make a new recipe
because
like we said mm huh mango we can do anything with it mm huh we can just do anything with mango
so you can just put like what Sprite
smash up the mango and then make it a mango soda you know
of course not
one of it is you know sometimes when you leave your mango outside for too long
um
you know when you leave your mango outside for too long and and then you never eat it like for a long time and then
when you will have the appetite to eat it er
after that while
then when you start to you know peel off the mango and then you see this um rotten part of the mango
then you taste the rotten part of mango and then
your appetite is just lost
but other than that um
uh this is why we have to um always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango um
um keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like um you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and um
other than that uh
uh ya it's ah after you like what he said like um
and then you blend it
it will definitely taste like ice cream like
it's like a mango yogurt ice cream you know something like that you know like
um
like a smashed mango but then it's frozen
it's cold it's like not it's like it's like not the normal eh err mango is just like
you know like
ice cream tasty like
mango you know
and um
for me personally I like mangoes that are cold
because I
don't like um
because I
like summer days ah you know when you eat this
oh my god
I totally forgot about it also
yeah and
oh my god how can we forget about that
when you eat during that hot weather and it melts in your mouth
you can taste the mango inside you can taste the freshness inside
when you uh after you exercise or after you
I tell you all it's really really really really nice
ah
um as per normal my day has been going great
err obviously
and ya today I've ah today I started school a bit later because um as per as per usual I always wake up late
but I will still attend to school and then um after school I will I will always work
and that's all I have to do find money
make myself happy pamper myself you know because
sometimes we have to love ourselves more
and make us eh make ourselves happy more happy ya
so how about your day
for me eh
actually
like just I heck care everybody I'm just going to do it

you know
most of the practical work
and

I didn't get to taste my mom's food
up to you bro
what about our favorite music
um
I listen to all genres right
is that what's the word
like from indonesian from english
and to spanish
because my type of
personality I like this hype song
you know when we are in the hype mood and then I like songs that um you know those emo emo songs
because I'm also an emo kid and
for
artist eh artist mostly I listen to ariana grande because
ariana grande is just

she got this cute little baby face um I I don't know ah I'm just in love with ariana grande
she's just my you know
she's just my love ah I I I don't know ah I'm her number one fan lah
how about you
my my favourite food
um
because
first thing it's western
and the best chicken chop that I've tasted is I think from tenderfresh
or maybe amigos and
you all should try their chicken chop because
their chicken chop
it's
very very like it's not spicy
but
yeah
even if
and then you see all these food porns you know it's like
oh tenderfresh eh um tenderfresh it's like an average price
it others are ah there's some food that is expensive but then there's some food that is also cheap
like it's just um how what what's the word that they call um
I think it's average ah
ya it's average average price so I think you should try lah you know
like your sister try already but then you haven't try no I should have bring you one um like bring you one of the food one day okay

but then one day he fell in love with a
err
like
it's very sad lah but then

of course my brother can speak really fluent but me
I can my indonesian is really really rusty
like I can just speak a bit but I understand what other people say when they're in they talk in indonesian

that time we eat the dinner at Chatime
yeah and then you wanted to buy your first then you wait for so long
the brown sugar pearls right because its closing already ah I think that's why
two more weeks before intern
then what about you
hmm
I don't know seh I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony lah if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or Teams ah
yeah I know right will you miss school duh
but I'm glad it's all over already lah no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
yeah I see
ah for this semester
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad lah because COVID then aviation sector like
rabak lah
why
but okay lah we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess lah I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again lah because its so nice yeah you should watch that
ha ha yes
yeah then ah do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to busan
okay
what about you
eh you told me that ah she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone lah
okay lah that's good lah
chey I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at tung lok kiew right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship lah because I'll be working with changi airport it just that I won't be getting salary lah
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad lah because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate lah she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
but they still get they still get paid like high salary ah like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like wah so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship lah because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope lah between the project and the job
no who enjoy seh
why
for long ah
what aiyo
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but wah this semester my grades okay lah decent only lah its not the grade that I expected
so how err how was
okay lah but it's quite hard lah to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct lah better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
oh
same lah I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me lah you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID err finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up err finance or course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal lah that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
wah
I see like wah nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes oh now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
oh muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have err thoughts lah like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like err nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have err it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small one lah then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults lah those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
yeah true lah
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
like err it will be inconvenience for them lah you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport lah like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard lah even if you take a bus or you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
but I feel I feel like err cafes in the west is like
quite boring ah
like I said
oh
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people
oh is it
I've never tried dalgona coffee before
yes
have you tried do it yourself
how does it feels like
oh yeah yeah sure I okay lah I mean I always see other people I always see other people drink but then like I feel like I'm the one that haven't drink it yet
err I think so should have ah
okay okay we shall do it
then what other
food or drinks ah
have you seen any new ones
oh yeah the bubble tea
oh like everything bubble tea kan
oh yeah I tried before lah this cake err a business sell cake like they pour the sauce on it like chocolate sauce or I forgot what was the flavor but I remember that err there's a pearl on it I think oh it's milk tea cake so the the cake is like err
you know like those sponge cake kind of flavor then they have the milk tea sauce also just pour over it and then they have some pearls so become like a bubble tea cake yeah it's nice actually surprisingly yeah
I feel like going to hunt for food
you know cafe hopping
I never done it before
like since so many cafe but
you know I've never tried everything lah it just yeah I just want to go like for that day we go to different cafes to try their food
yeah
most importantly we need money
I want to go staycation do you want to go with me
I don't know lah oh actually we wanting to go staycation at sentosa
yeah I've seen many hotels like very nice but then like then can be quite expensive ah depends on where you want to go also
yes I also miss going malaysia going for all the good food wah but then the border is closed until thirty first december eh
so you have to wait until next year hopefully by then they will open the border and the COVID thing is gone and then we can start traveling again
oblong

rabbit
yeah and then that time my father ate it
but I don't how it taste like ah
but you know you should try someday
four four over five
the burger stall is err just a few houses away from my aunt's place yeah so just have to walk there
yeah
yeah malaysia is so nice

eh but then that time I already went okay lah technically that was a good day lah but I never catch anything
no not not me lah then the others all catch lah I just relax ah
but then the the best part kan you know this one scary scary story lah little bit lah scary horror so that time I I went there that was like three in the morning three in the morning then then two of my friend ah actually I think sulaiman wasn't there ah sulaiman wasn't with us
so there was I think the five of us if I'm not wrong there was five of us then two of them sleep already
han sleep then I think wan
wah rhyme wan five
then I think you should be wan five lah should be wan five okay
don't ask lah don't ask that was a a bad experience weird experience
ya so we we take the log then we just take some dry logs lah then we just make fire then he was cooking I think he was cooking Maggie mee ah
Maggie mee and hotdog
eh no he he haven't even throw his his rod ya then was three already
because at the right side only got because it was this one is an open area it's an open area
then there was two ways to go to the sea so the three of them go this way me and I forgot who ah I think
han ah we go to the right so um
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there ah this one was han han and the rest went I I didn't went there
han already know lah he he got experience before then after that he knows that this one is
um like oh err then he just keep quiet lah
then he he knows already lah then he just stay awake lah then the next day the driver came ah came to pick them up
that that particular
mm
mm
but it's not from malaysia lah oh so they they hear all over
so loud
mm
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic ah
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
ah I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we ah ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move alamak
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out lah huh
lah kan eh
mm
mm
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then err
ya lah
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central err ah ya
mm
within the week
within the month
ya
ya lah
surrounding surrounding
ah okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
ah
so what you did you tell anyone no ah
but but whose that middle person
mm
then different different person
mm
fandi ahmad
wah
mm
mm
ya that's why lah is
who will be the one main speakers ah who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then fandi ahmad at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that lah
ah
game lah
mm
a caricature lah
mm
but this is but this one is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help ah
ya
ya lah ya lah
ya lah
mm ya is a
ah
yes
ya
then after that then the way I see you edit ah aduh is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that one was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
definitely lah
eh feelings feelings
say goodbye
sulaiman
tolong
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
oh
err podcast
per month ya
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address lah the address of the company then after that then I was like okay lah at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two lah
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two lah eh cannot be what no there's no there was it's just allowance
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and eh boss uh can ask you something ah yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask ah the the allowance
is one thousand ah because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand ah
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
I give it to you
typical malay ah
aduh
actually I so
just asking ah I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple lah keep it simple
mat-mat mat-mat ah
nothing lah it's nothing nothing much
ah so little bit lah just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school lah ah oh ya talking about
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
because I I myself also got um work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is ah the pay to me is I tell you lah it's quite it's quite ah quite decent for I would say err part time lah because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get lah so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that one is motor lah but ya lah but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders ah per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
a good place for you to like start lah then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
marina barrage
marina tower
marina got what marina bay sands
six hours
huh so fast wait you run or you walk you walk
so fast then why why when we
maybe maybe we I should I should start with you ah what nine five five
five five eight

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

we
but can't
maybe won't get
so
okay but
whoa K
but K for the ladies
dayah

mm
mm
mm

you know then then you start to tear up heavily know like waterfall like
then ya I go then I go then I see my friend the friend cry then I even I even cry
he asked me zul err err why
scared of death lah basically
and you don't know what what happened to you after that what you know

you forgot about it right you wanted to know mine
okay mine is okay let's say from my first wish actually I never even think about getting wishes like
like I don't know I feel like so fake ah really can get wish meh
but if I were really to think about it eh like on the spot hmm
my wish is
K lah I really want money ah so I don't have to stress about working or whatever shit
K lah since err just now I give you like a hard one I ask you for quantity kan
what is err
think ya I mean ah might as well go big right

uh about the age of eighty eighty I never asked for hundred ah eighty but if I prolong a bit longer nevermind but minimum eighty
uh apparently the genie err said you only have three wishes sorry
err rejected ya I mean ah you you could have changed the everlasting one to err
an everlasting life to what err I wish to live a long life to eat food and not gain weight right
ya and you see so you can enjoy it
see you next time so you you got a wish uh guidance err person here so anything before you make a wish I think you can come to me
ya ya ya you you can find me on carousell lah wish guidance counsellor

ya okay
oops
K K K K next next what next
yeah
mm go back to the future what I wanna do ah
wah this one very deep seh question
mm
err can we like pass can we do a easier non deep question you know ah this one I really need to think sia need to recall need to dwell on the past
ya too much feels
um currently now I am err working
ya
healthcare swabber
health promotion board
yup
uh huh uh huh yup so that's what I'm working as now lah currently then yourself
ah so this is what you call holiday lah not err just fresh graduate waiting to find a job
uh huh

okay finish already
uh huh
ah
hair tie and bag okay what on platforms like carousell
oh seller like those home based businesses
not like those mini one lah non non uh ACRA registered ah
ACRA ACRA
ya so if you own a business you need to start thinking about ACRA so ACRA is err let me tell you what it stands for ah it's accounting and corporate regulatory authority
ya so in it's a ministry whereby you need to you know all those income tax et cetera that kind I mean that is IRAS so this is ACRA ACRA is for business registration kind all those companies lah basically companies
ya but still err that's why they say unregistered home based businesses ah ha
ya and but are still unregistered you see so that kind lah so um ya I don't know this is like this grey those grey area kind apparently my start up is ACRA registered lah
ya
mmhmm mmhmm
I mean it's good lah so how is it doing so far
ah okay
okay so but so err haven't sell much at or haven't sell at all or
sell already
sell some already so is it doing well
so you just gonna do this
so sending out resumes already lah
okay I mean that's good that's a start wait so you're how old now just graduate in
walao still very young lah
what the hell twenty seven already ya
yup
ya but I'm stuck at uh twenty four
uh I mean like
I I
no I I'm really stuck at twenty four just that the facial hair growing at the age of twenty
no no I I I feel like err
no you you will you will understand once you age like like you feel like your age is fixed at a certain that one but the number just keeps increasing
nope you you you will you will you will soon
I am the last one
ya
oh you're the youngest also
okay and you're the youngest alright
yes because your wish is part of a superpower I actually want to ask like superpower itself because I wanna ask you so that because you have to ask me back lah ya so what superpowers do you want
uh apparently you already got that wish granted so now you're invisible
you already got you already got the power of dracula also and and uh okay uh the the the the food giving one eliminated
no you want to hear something new
ah
a teleportation
okay lah so just teleportation hmm okay good
in this era it would be
err
I mean assuming my wishes are granted then
err
wah ya like if I really were to think about something like in depth quite hard lah cause I I I want like I I want mind reading even though I can read people's err err
even though I can read people no even though I can read people I mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so mm mind reading maybe maybe not
err printing money apparently I already say if I don't have my wish granted yup I want that um teleportation sounds good also
mm but is it for one person or two person I don't know
your teleportation can teleport you only or like like you can hold people and like boom tele
ya ya ya
the err what do you call that night crawler ah
but night crawler need to imagine the place then you can go if you
uh so nightcrawlers one is limited ah err
woo seh
uh oh now ah um ah then suddenly
ah the red light district of singapore
oh now don't know I thought you say all okay imagine can just teleport only
ah oh I see oh now now you take back
yup I mean
whatever lah let's say my money dry up I just print some more lah
no lah not copy and paste ah just my hand like you know a deck of cards of money come out like that okay yup
the money is come out like that
can lah anytime you no need to get a genie lah my my superpower can lah give you some
today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask err wish
you ask me what err what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I also I also short term memory
ah
ya it's the smallest err smallest more specialised err what you call that
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it lah it's such a small community
um but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it lah
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like um I deal more with uh like all the machine machine instead of people
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
in a in a way err the field lah I want to be is actually like err psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go err what you call that err undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that lah and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
uh huh so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do lah unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
err ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money lah like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly
um okay let me think of a question okay

oh then got the is it is it like out of twenty one kind of
oh I I got caught off guard
oh okay
ah that there's nothing much to me lah
okay let's uh let's see a random question ah

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
oh okay lah
have you how many times you had to use it so far
ah I used to have to eat a lot of um cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic lah
mm
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was err developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my mm
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
how do I what
mmhmm
ah
but I realised that I didn't react
uh nine months since I've been to the doctor
I should start uh
mm
tangkak
it's
uh is like one or two hours
ya
I think ah the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
juice like the drink yes yes
at that time ah
ya and then
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in um in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
did you um see
ya
wrap wrap
wrap
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
mm
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's err you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
why are you not eating
oh
are you going to cook or what
oh ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
oh how old is she
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
ah ya
ah
mm
like
if she caught me
shower
to make sure that I properly err you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat um olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
mm mm mm
and then err I gave up you know what I did
mm
oh your your cough medication is too much
okay lah kan maybe
hmm
ah you need to take your time lah
mm have you have you done the portal
mm
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
hmm hmm
hmm
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
mm
ah to go to work
mm
but
mm
kan
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
ah ya
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
it's hard
mm actually actually
we would rent a place together ah
mm but don't know lah
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
I think you just have to find the right one
wei you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer lah
oh ah
you know did I explain to you my new title
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
uh the data is from the paper that he published
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
ya
I also agree about the reading part
in a different way
mm so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
last sem
I think kan I think she knows uh means she learn from last sem
and then he said that um farid ask how we how did we do as a class
mm I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
mm
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
mm
no but you know lah how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
mm I think
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
make sense mm
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
hmm
did you hear about the girl
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
mm
mm
imagine imagine the dad
mm
mm we just have to wait and see
mm
no if my mum is around I don't cook
mm
I do the after part
mm
I think my
excuse me
actually that's why that's why it
mm
hmm
ya
err ah best
ya wei
you know what I grew up on was um how I met your mother
you know have to break the rules
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
exactly you just download the the book the E book
ya my my mom eh my parents have this friend
and then
oh no I'm so embarrassed
it's not any of the siblings is another sibling
that's like doesn't exist
I think because my brain doesn't really shut down
like I do get recurring dream
that I'm driving in my family's car like the estima
and I don't know how to drive
but I'm really
after I wake up
ya and then actually the the thing that I remember is the feeling of the dream
but I don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
mm
for
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
what was your worst case scenario
you are in a group with who
oh
good news is we are in the same group
bad news is the other people in the group
are the last people I want to choose
ya
I don't remember but it's one of her group mates is okay like it's not bad
let me find it
oh ya I saw yesterday right
mm
still
or you can transfer clinic
we'll see lah
haiya
you know you know my sister getting married right
we have eight weeks but
how
I cannot imagine ah
mm
mm mm
reception
mm
so we will see lah but I cannot imagine my sister being married
ah so
we watch the same things
my first first time first time experiencing this
my sister my younger sister have to go through this five times
mm
ah my my older sister is the oldest the first one
then I have two brothers and then I have another two sisters
even though we have like six years difference between us
doesn't feel like six years
mm
mm
mm she's your only younger sister right
mm
but I I don't think I I've seen your siblings faces because you don't post about them
ya
ugh
so
you know
hmm
uh upcoming assignment
ya so I think I'm going to do my now that I can
amazing kan
but she's very active and like she will she's like trying to walk here and there every day everywhere and then she likes to eat
she eats
and then her mouth will be ah please give me some
I need
mm
oh ya I saw
I think you saw I saw I saw in your story that your the cat always come to your room

okay so the topics that we will be talking today ah it's um firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me ah I like science lah so maybe ten years in the future kan I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and ah whatever there is lah so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also uh ten years time probably um I would like to
uh I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my uh
my computing whatsoever lah
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe uh so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so mm
uh you were in your future house
and then um maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
mm
mind is stimulated ah
uh more to like action thriller
uh okay for for me uh I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you uh in-hand situations about uh about issues that could surface in the future lah uh technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like oh it helps me to
solve problems easily and uh see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode eh
the reason why she was trapped is because um
uh her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting lah how they plan to uh get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then ah sometimes he can ah turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked lah cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end uh some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so uh he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and uh there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape lah so it was quite surprising interesting ah how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that eh hmm
if you can become an actor
uh what
hmm if you can become an actor eh and like any actor eh do you prefer uh do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
mm
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is ah not getting cheaper these days
so I think uh focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases ah correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be um how can mental health be um what's that addressed
and how can be um
how can we uh better improve our mental health area general
uh projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
uh rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given ah should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity ah
uh off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system ah like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
um
um how many one point two grams of uh phosphorus is needed to make uh I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to uh not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so uh moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever ah where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
oh when you were a little child
work studies stress ah
we play
mm
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
uh memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
um shape you and how you are today
ah
probably mm
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby uh in the european universe or the western part of the world
ah there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but uh there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
um ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and ah people were killed and people were died from um
um unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
uh the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know sina ah al jazali
uh mariam
abu sayde or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam lah I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you ah
so apart from like
mm going back in time
um what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to uh have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to um to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal lah you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
ah
uh I think first lah I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
uh I wish
uh I wish that uh world hunger can be stopped lah cause
and they went in first world country
uh no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from uh camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad lah so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope ah nobody would go hungry lah in this world
and ah the second wish would be ah
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause uh we don't have the technology
because even from um the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
eh three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so um I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out um others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish uh actually uh I think I
I wish to have my own family one day inshallah
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
uh have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me lah I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but um just hope to you know
um get married one day
okay so mm
so maybe uh cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think uh I think
is not really essential lah but apparently
uh you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
uh if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be uh be taught to the world
but um having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life lah
yup
respect
won't look down on you lah
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's um
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you lah that uh having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed ah speed
inshallah
uh huh
I I like to teleport ah
ya
mmhmm
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
mmhmm
you know is is very easily easy lah I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like oh ah when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like um we have uh we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry um some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to um playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind lah that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
err is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation lah
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think uh uh this thing
trait between and humans probably uh they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have um
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
uh some uh some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
uh for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something lah something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
um especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be um probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
uh like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it lah
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting ah to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from um human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many um so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
uh huh

sorry sorry
okay so summary
okay so um if you guys are listening to this I'm sorry but please don't judge please don't judge our situation now okay so
what were uh we were talking about this and then we we got reminded that wait lah we got reminded wait wait wait we got reminded uh that you know we could have used this time
when we were talking to record this so ya so in a um let me just summarise
K you summarise you practise your summarising skills
I am not confused
okay I am not confused it's just that um
how do I say this
send him me
orh sorry sorry please accept us
fuck
I think he's just being nice
and he is nice that's why I am fond of him
at that point of time no
hi no as in we were talking already but it was before it was
but that was back
then like a few months before
um
K ya no
yes
me
I feel so attacked
no that's why that's okay so one thing that um
I think I'm defending him lah but one thing about him is that you know he takes his time you know and he doesn't he wants to date wait wait wait
in a halal way so in a halal way means right you know
ya I mean okay okay
please don't talk about him now talk about like we talk about me ya ya ya wait wait talk about me now my situation so
I am currently interview eh uh sorry ah uh please don't think um please describe yourself okay so
one thing about me right is that um I know I am still studying and I still have two years left
but then I want to work on myself
but then I still want to make friends you know even with the opposite gender just to you know ya wait just to make just you know um
just enjoy my time with them and then like there's no pressure and whatnot so with him right there's no pressure
even because I know myself I'm
even when I talk to guys or talk to my friends or whatever ah talk to people right I will take sometimes I will take hours just to reply them it's and it's not that and it's not that I am
and it's not that I am not interested it's just that I am just tired
I'm just tired I I mean I can admit that you know if I really care
I am never too busy for you but at this point of time I I acknowledge the fact that you know I I am still in that in that situation so that's why
whenever like we just talk then don't talk like that that kind of thing right I understand why
and I don't want to you know put a lot of pressure so okay so why we were talking about this even
uh I did settle for that kind of guy ah which was stupid ah bloody stupid ya I I mean no lah but then that's why so
if this is how he's going to act during the relationship blah blah blah that puts a lot of pressure into this this this this dynamic
if we set a plan we've already you know plan something then we go out then I will just enjoy my time with you
ya I will just enjoy my time with you then okay bye bye thank you for the day blah blah blah
because there's no pressure
if I ya if I
really like you then I want you to accept me as a date wait as a date and
then I would feel a lot of
I will feel ya I will feel a lot of pressure just to ask him because I know that there's a risk of me getting rejected
I know the game then that's why now
okay so the whole point is no pressure no pressure I enjoy my time with you when I when I'm with you I spend my time with you
that's why I'm not dating them
I am what when we are together I am getting to know you
I don't want to touch the relationship I mean I know his past relationships and all
that's why I'm the friend now
then what the fuck am I
thank you for listening to my TED talk
I understand
ya understand it's just that
uh okay so now I'm just telling you that
even though it is my first time asking a guy out
even though it's my first time asking a guy a guy out
if I don't feel like you know uh uh um it's a huge step for me because right
I enjoy my time with you then you know I just want to enjoy another time with you lah I know that's why that kind of thing that's why there's no pressure

okay you know what I'm just drill him drill eh
can meet together or not

drink tea on my patio patio patio
gape gap gap what
orh no lah he knows my family background what

in par with me
in academic wise academic wise he's he's not there
what
how can he say how can he
think that when he's
because I think you know what
is it's ego lah you guys
the thing is about him right I don't think he has a real like really really correct like a real relationship before because right
the the the wait the ex the the ex the official ex that he was with before right cheated on him but then when I got to know how they are
during that relationship right I don't think it was
a real relationship I'm sorry lah but um
that was like during his teens lah like I think eighteen nineteen
ya that's why then after that
eighteen ya but then when I heard about the relationship right I don't think it's what
I would consider as a real relationship
I think some app
dating app
I don't know
okay so
eh wait is
is Muzmatch new
is Muzmatch new
I think so
ya
I mean I I never use before lah so I don't know
orh
fuck you okay
mm
are you talking about the girl or him
the girlfriend that cheated on him he met from Muzmatch
not really ah I mean she cheated on him after all how is that religious
because she's not over the ex before
she met hakim
like she was still friends with the ex which I think it was fucking stupid because
how can you be friends with an ex
I wouldn't say I mean we went out a few times before but we have never read as in I wouldn't I don't know okay fuck it lah you know what eh what with amin eh
I dated amin before but then now we always go out but with syafiq lah
really meh
even if even with syafiq even with syafiq
okay
once I tell once I
ya
what if what if err when I hang out wait when I hang out with syafiq and amin right because
err then I bring the guy
can ya then can what
orh
I mean ya lah I I get it but usually when I go out with syafiq
or amin right it's always both of them is not one even if
huh
me and amin no ah we are friends even though we dated each other
uh he's not
so how it ended with me and amin is that he was the one who ended it ya so
um he didn't say why but he told amin eh he told syafiq it's because like he feels that uh he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way eh
amin now
back then ya I was fond of him that's why I'm still friends with him
why
syafiq
syafiq I've been friends with him for more than a decade already eh
ya I mean
ya
so even
no but if if if
but is when I go out wait when I go out right it's not only like individually what is both of them
how is that weird
alah rilek ah I still single what I still enjoying my time here
ya lah then fuck it lah lose lose ah
what mm
sorry
mm mm
mm
ya I mean with amin
with amin I I think there's a possibility that we will fall out because of our history but with syafiq I don't think so lah because we were friends like way way way way way way way
ya
with amin no lah
he knows eh that I I dating around all after him
he knows he knows all about the dates that I went
we friends already we friends what because we are friends you know why cause syafiq is our mutual friend
mm so wait ah
eh I make him laugh eh funny as shit man
mm

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
okay lah I will try lah this monday when I meet him
mm
portrait the fuck
mm
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
aiya I I give people the benefit of doubt lah
so anyway um so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump lah I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this one ah this one I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
eh no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so um the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
she doesn't want that
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and um
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said lah what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
um
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ready to settle down I think lah almost there lah but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl lah but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
mm
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason ah
ya
uh I never ask for details
mm
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really ah I no one has no one has asked me
at all
orh ya
uh huh
uh huh
mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
ah
oops

my friend said is good lah so I don't know she said that the ending was funny even though I think she thinks that it wasn't supposed to be funny but she laughed
so ya so when she
so she was asking me eh you go watch ah to see if it's funny or not she don't want to laugh alone
see ah FOMO sia FOMO ya
ya so that's that lor
wah I damn hungry
eh got the bread eh oh ya later I need to go shop
buy bread buy bread and cigarettes
I think I want to buy drinks also
nowadays I feel like drinking you know sweet drinks
no lah eh you know the past few days I keep shitting
I kept shitting you know why cause of the fucking lemon water
ya eh then adeline was asking me
eh you drink lemon water ah nice ah then I say nice ah ya you ah
halal you ya it will make you shit in the morning eh really ah
you know how adeline is right ya really ah
lemon water everyday how many slices
one slice ah or you want two slice also can one slice sometimes a bit bland say really ah okay I try
so I influence a lot of people sandra beth
adeline
I can do your marketing for you fake no kidding
just kidding
ya
ya I still an intern eh I'm still a student
ya
eh we should talk to each other not to the to the fella listening to this
with one stone lah sial with one bird walao
you kill the bird already then you kill more bird
ya eh so what did aziq say ah what did aziq's mum say
the divorce part
eh ya sia eh what happen ah nevermind it's okay

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much
and then you have feeling ah that ah you are human that you know that uh sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
err emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
mm
forever ya forever you be
ya
um ya true true
ya true
mm ya
breakdown
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
um um
somehow you were saying that family knows best lah
okay err family know best in terms of tackling one err let's say the mother lah because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming err since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
um ya true
um
so because chicken
oh complain and complain
mm oo mm mm
oo
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
um
mm ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do uh a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global err
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

one
oh nevermind lah
oh no lah I was just looking at the jurassic mile
um
I think track in changi airport
today or some some some time maybe I I dah

so far
in the future
so
uh
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits lah
so what do you think how about you
huh serious
ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
okay lah ya
jalan kayu ah

maybe I should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and oh my god taste like medicine
mm mm
wow
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food oh my god
it's terrible
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money err ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt lah
a'ah

I would say that I I have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow I didn't regret any of it lah because everyday I woke up I know that that's something I want to do
I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm ya
ya
business gives you more autonomy in some way

nowadays lah like I I really want to travel lah I really want to save money and
and travel lah so ya lah a lot a lot you cannot do a lot of things right now lah
mm you know during COVID so
ya so all I can do is is find job right now ah the the last
they're talking about talking about my uh barbering job and all that I
I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct mm
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs eh actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like tampines interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from tampines interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like um
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
err cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot uh like harder
times lah a lot of people going through like more hardship lah you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite um
I just feel quite sad lah sometimes when I see all this lah ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced lah forced to
forced to stop working and
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
ya but anyway like um
mm
mmhmm
wherever lah
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business ah catering business they do sell
ya then it's not only that lah uh basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped lah then no cannot get money lah music business
so the next thing that
err like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies lah video
I mean um
right now video is doing
more important lah video is doing well lah like ya um
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a err uh to make a content right so
are out there lah there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
oh I if had taken a video err course or what then
mm
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then

at such a young age I was thinking like I was nineteen years old eh how old are twenty one I was doing what oh I was in
eh actually no lah twenty one I was already doing theatre I already acting
I started at nineteen what
um after I was bored then I decided to sign up for all
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
I was doing backstage work
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything ah is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like
eh
ah
considered um
performance but don't count ah they didn't even pay me seh
can you come over can you like
no lah actually before before that happens
uh take over whoever's not here lah so I was just doing my job very well lah whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
so that was my first acting ah and then because of that I was confident to audition for young and wild for rice for
theatre artistic and theatre practice theatre practice was the first one first show that I ever did ah
I would say travel overseas brother

hundred fifty but that it was just on
she was talking about she want to promote our company
um which is called Faust but instead um she went to say oh when my son attended drama at another company
I can see that my son really love drama so please ah then she then she just put our blurb that we give her at the bottom
like we like eh if you want to promote us and then you start to mentioning your other company for what right and then how is that and then
that post has influenced people to buy the programme also what okay we also don't know
how what were they when they sign up where they get it from actually no we didn't have have have much sales ah
because after that after that post so we told her lah eh your your your influence is not very influential lah so how

mm
mm
mm
mm

like
mm
mm
mm
the one who actually paying lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm noted

okay
relax jer just just sound
no lah don't force it lah don't force it
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm
oh no
recording interrupted
oh let's pause first oh shoot
okay lah it's fifty five minutes fifty six seconds
err nevermind let me ask her uh
oh no okay uh
let me ask
hi my recording got interrupted
at the fifty five
minute
fifty six seconds mark
okay let me settle
should be okay lah alright nevermind we just submit this one lah
oh stop stop stop

hmm three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe uh I feel that err it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next uh the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes furqan
uh
my views on what your wishes are it's actually uh is very good from what I see you are a people person like err like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at tampines I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like err taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say uh for example I I share an example ah
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food uh food court I teleport to the place
then after that uh I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay err you said it can increase because the person uh didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so err let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about err going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and uh maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's uh maybe uh the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
ah which is easier to contact tourists
it is uh something
err
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know err be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
err I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one err mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of uh being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe uh act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but err
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it uh
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that err you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to uh ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that err you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means err if a person is a father
okay so err what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of uh two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man uh should isolate himself
for months
I feel uh I I agree to a certain extent err where
let's say this person have uh no responsibility maybe uh no parents no siblings no children no wives then uh I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say err okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example uh a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually err pretty similar ah on on the investment part because err actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves err a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
err
if you were to tell me that investment is uh is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe err last time I was maybe too good ah I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society err when they see oh a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much err about monetary err maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old err ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more uh gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this uh money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go uh anywhere that I want because err there's a certain level of err financial freedom I would say
second topic
oh my my memory memory is err degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
oh I admit uh do you have you heard of uh about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep uh items
or uh photos ah to then err to keep in a secret place or maybe err some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video err it's like a conversation with uh my old my my oldest self so let's say err my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually err when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so uh I just hope I don't lose the video lah actually I don't even remember where is it now
hmm I like to be famous yes
but
but uh I think is uh if I were to take myself a picture of myself err every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in uh asia that uh that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic err trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so err I think there is err what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of uh funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that err short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then uh another err much more serious err
uh experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me err makes me err
then err maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was uh I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that err jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to uh go into uh into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then err
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that err it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually err and even err just now I was riding a bike
err due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so uh I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
uh
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
err someone is err or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of err delivery riders who is uh riding very recklessly around uh uh on the road ah because they are
err chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe uh road uh sorry uh lorry drivers lorry drivers
err less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because err err when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example err if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can err plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering uh maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that err we are not so err I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe uh three hobbies one is err maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start err ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
err I would know I'm I'm not really a good uh soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because err I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that uh soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me err easily when whenever err people especially uh in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said oh let's play soccer outside
uh this way you gain uh relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and err in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems err I think is is is quite interesting
err
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some err activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure uh how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because err in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals err so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less err how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think uh as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
err
so far I think eh all the err hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from err we are kind of uh similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

popeyes okay lah for popeyes
popeyes with potato whereas whipped potato was not that

and you will be comforted
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
he didn't fell in love at first
and then like they help through each other ah but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
oi it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front oh okay I'm sorry I can't remember

but I like grazy grace mainly because of her content like her criminal stories
become insane like a psycho
graduation
like you know ah I think if I'm not wrong there's like a universal language where it's like basically just signs and you like those signs that actually has specific pronunciation to it pronunciation or something like that miss lee told me about it before during lit class I think was like a few years ago
but I remember that because she ranted on how much she hated though she ended up being a teacher
really
what
hais
late night talk late night talk
plagiarism lah
um
if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then
ugh I don't want friend you anymore
like I want her I mean him to have his own house like
he's like I don't know he like to sleep like dozen places you know he like to hide under the sofa
you want to come with me
no girl that's just psycho I want like blackout windows
I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
oh wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby jungkook now he's so aww
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
oi
why
why not
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
I don't know what I ask her ah and after that she suddenly said like her mum ah did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like oh then why why is she not working because I legit ask ah out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said ah
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very atas lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle kan it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
ya
ya
I mean
why
so you don't know insha and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team lah I would have like shouted at her but then oh my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on insha story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then ah
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars

hmm
mmhmm
can we see him
we haven't seen each other for
long time
wedding eh
but do they have a
a great wedding
what's that
oh
who's that see
why
hello baby
oh
mm

okay hi azli yes and we both of us are um married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say oh automatically I said yes one so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like ah because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
uh condo credit card car and whatever the C lah but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like um like what you want to do when we get married
will be like oh no this one lah
he cannot I already mah so you say that you end up
so when that time when um it was my turn right um I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like um does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually um proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up ah that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like uh knows um a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
ha decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah
because of the and the right that one all um we we prepare ourselves yes uh I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
uh we all all our by ourself lah
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like um they say it in um
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them ah then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think uh we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars eh I was about to fork out everything eh to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't eh I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then uh at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because uh it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give lah but that time
ah ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways uh it actually works I print exactly lah that's why ah you got extra correct so that time
so uh eventually after that we that's not the only problem ah during our wedding ah actually my greatest fear for uh
quite popular in suria also and uh he's one of the funniest guy ah I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out alah
ya wasted sia it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like walao not on my wedding lah sia
but before our wedding there was this uh issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free lah contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better eh best eh until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also uh still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel lah so shout out to azuri and then um
ya our our wedding take place azuri azur but uh the his name is azuri
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
ya
is very much um
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy err better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so um is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage ah the wedding ah
oh ya the weather it was nice ah
mm
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
eh
ya
mm
ah
mm
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing ah for you ah for me the luckiest will be the photo ah no no not the photography the photography was good ah the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing ah that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of um crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
kan ya so just to ask you again but um
we go through like a lot of stuff lah eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
uh marvels uh
um some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling kan
mm
ya
chey that was a punishment though
eh
I don't know eh oh I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me ah I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry ah because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also lah
no lah but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then um like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that um we wanted to do lah
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage lah
ah so that's why lah
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so um
can I just ask you another question ah before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me lah
mm
eventually he is like one okay guy lah so okay lor okay last question
last question lah I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me ah
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding ah marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity uh I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault ah it's your fault but then um there's no such thing as tercheat ah
ter ter there's no such thing as that one for for what I know lah
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me lah
ya correct ah then about uh then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people ah that one
uh never give me stress also because like the thing is that um in-laws right
okay lah still got we we there was a bond there ha and now uh we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
uh we want to create our own family here lah ha
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future um request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years lah we are already in our
oh my god do I know this
okay I think uh because um for the last past five months eh five years I have been like driving you crazy kan okay the thing is that um
okay ah I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family lah like another um junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that uh another person ah in our family lah kan
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so um I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually uh know
about you more lah
because of the time lah if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that uh to me
I like cooking lah not really into cleaning up ah he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya kan
okay so um that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

ah uni at is that premium
so it's just a one year course so ya
ya
one year
ya just one year
one year and is only for like a forty K
forty K including the food and the house
ya ya but then weekly need to pay around like um eight hundred weekly ah for the rent yes yes ya correct
including ah including their school fees and stuff ya four thousand but it's actually okay ah
ya
ya so what are you gonna do like like stick in this job
are you thinking of upgrading yourself
oh ya how long how long you have you work
oo that's fast
are you planning to change to what industry
oh ya but now also not the time to change cause of COVID
ya correct
ya correct there's no job
oh ya ya a lot of people are looking into um childcare jobs
ya
ya correct you have to take the course
you can take part time I don't know if it's subsidised or something it is it
oh oh the or the swag yes correct correct oh
oh
worth it lah because it's for long term like for until you die what you hold that cert
oh the
P C or something is it uh huh oh you wait until you are twenty five day then you can get the
the work and learn shit I don't know ah what is it
uh okay then you can upgrade yourself what then
mmhmm
um
but what if they don't upgrade you you know now is not the time for promotion or
no increment lah
oh
admin you know admin actually
two point five thousand yes they earn a lot
they just sit office and book flights for the managers just simple admin stuff like or the food cause my
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
which admin which department
because depends on department like my friend is a admin for like err department admin
so like she's like the receptionist
so so like when you enter she's there
uh ya don't have the more so but then now she move on to a better job that job offers her two point seven now
register order nothing nothing about law cause it's just admin work like the you know
ya
yup
ya but nevermind you can just now like gain experience then you can go for senior admin ya correct
then people ya
ya I mean is very tough ah
what
okay new doctor is easy to handle because they don't do anything what you can like okay doctor okay doctor
why
uh huh
a'ah
okay but then okay lah working with new doctors they tend to depend on you which is better
whose fault is that is your fault what it's the doctor's what oh X-ray oh
I mean then you talk to the head X-ray department lah
so ya
I haven't send in my petition but I already got the form I mean I still have time
I haven't go buy thing during my holidays my next holiday is december then I can go banks but bank now the loan rate is very low because of their bad economy so these is good and a bad thing ah
now is like I'm like ah whatever just go lor because even if I go now there's no job maritime job for me
of course right now I think I'm like
whatever like just do it no because I just
ya that's life ya that's why ya correct correct
nothing is certain sia now like
mm correct
alright
ya I'm not ready to be no adulthood lah so I think I should study one more year
master
if because master in is also one year usually master takes like a lot of years like maybe three years if I'm not wrong I'm not sure
while uni in singapore is four years
um degree first their master then PhD uni is degree
then they way to continue ah if you got the money
ah if I got the money I guess or maybe I will work first and then I take my master part time
until PhD I don't know if
so ya lah so I'm after my career now so
cause there's nothing is certain lah
ah ya correct so

or you can just come
to me when I want to go back singapore what but then you come like one one week early
ya that one perfect ya
ya I think that ya

mm
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
oh
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
err you want me to countdown
eight nine eight seven six five four three two one
happy new year

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm
oh ya ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan
no huh
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh
ya but it was very funny uh but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
mm
ya lah mm mm
ya
mm
mm
oh
ah
hmm
you mean I can just call them and ask
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
then I buy ah urgent visa lah which cost like I think four hundred over dollars eh
I think hong kong or somewhere lah that is a chinese uh I mean a a locals asia PAC ah
not china leh we seldom go china what it's hong kong not
philippine
uh this type of country uh
oh vietnam maybe vietnam passport
passport ah I think passport right
mm
and he doesn't need to like I think it's quite recently that they changed the countries eh
the countries that uh can my must apply visa cannot apply visa on arrival he say last time when he when he go there he straightaway apply visa on arrival it's like no issues
kan
hmm
ya lah
then he was asking me so err did I get my visa already
aiyo
ya
I don't know
ah ha kan
the one with the censored one or the correct one
haiya
hmm but it's fun lah I mean I mean it's it's quite nice lah
mm
ya lah
that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay lah but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days lah I won't be lucky forever I'm just
ya lah
kan
mm
ya lah whether I can whether they will survive or not if they survive I survive ah but like suddenly if they ask me to leave then how
mm local
that's why it's
so should I find a job or not should I apply for a new job or what
ya and then maybe if something comes up
right
ya lah ya lah that's why just go and find only lah ah
just
but like not in a desperate need lah like just send out first and then uh see if like got interview just go and then you know like keep the options open in case

life starts at forty
eh in fact eh when you're forty right there's start you assess it eh more things we appreciate true ah
true ah it's like when you're in your twenties right oh okay a lot of things okay lah I don't want lah I don't know yet lah but after I have gone through eh
eh good man a lot things seh like ah
differently mm
mm
yes and your perspective of things also change
the last time was like what is this now like wah
you become wah excites you you know

friends lah I I know it's important but then uh friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you uh uh I mean like you can share things together
oh yes uh I'm more like want to have a peace of mind lah just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think uh because uh we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this uh the ten years time is to whereby I would like uh you know um
um
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
ah ah ah like for you how
there will be new one I let go
um
mm
mm mm
mm
so meaning that ah
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty lah so at that age you
you still want to like uh you know pursue your interest
uh in science
okay
mm mm
okay
uh if there was a drama kan um I mean I like to watch action movie lah actually
ya cause action movie
working but then you you
you really like um awake that means you're really awake and you are like uh
you are you are really amazed you know amazed
ya stimulated and you are really amazed by their their skills lah
ah
yes correct uh correct
scenario settings uh you know once in a while okay lah once in a while ya
how about you
what kind of uh genre did you like to watch
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay okay
mmhmm mm
mmhmm
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no lah that one is different question
mmhmm
uh I think fit body lah better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina uh you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors lah okay I mean like everyday life also lah we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important lah
yes correct correct
ya correct of course um of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks uh you know ah people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally lah like that
so what will you think
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
ya so you see eh like nowadays generation you can see the different generation eh how they are very um they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always ah you know
that is only external but not internal you see ah this is what they they forgot lah so I think um
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm okay because I think about mental health ah it has to be
uh
ah that any friends that you think that uh that support you and any friends that you that uh you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself lah whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
ah at least at least you have uh somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
mmhmm mmhmm
ah
mm
mmhmm
correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm
mmhmm mm mm
I think ya it's true it's true I think that um okay when you talking about the schools eh um
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being ah they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further lah
ah because ah
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya lah ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
where would I want to go
mm
children days are really a a days that memorable days lah I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like uh like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of uh like childhood memories lah childhood fond memories but like as for me
uh as a kid ah ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep ah that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody lah have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
oh okay
mm
mm
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
mmhmm
um
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
mm
mm
uh three wishes eh
um okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is uh
a healthy life lah
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then um
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children eh when they are in need children in hunger ah you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think um a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one uh the third one
what is it ah third one ah
mm
like for me right I think the other wish is that mm
but um
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy lah healthy body and healthy mind
uh and then the the best part is uh good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good uh behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
um respect others
uh yes then um the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important lah
uh to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope lah that my children are not like that and then uh I just hope that whatever that my children do they must uh always think that life is really temporary
uh in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there um
ah that is my my wishes lah I I think for my for my children
for my children
mm
yes correct no I mean uh of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
ah you see
ya no
mm
mm
okay
mm
ya
ya
there is uh good and bad lah we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first eh
see ah there there is a good and bad lah when talking about phones okay uh cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
ah you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy lah and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult lah to control it is more I think challenging
ah now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control ah you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy lah it's not really easy
mm it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
mm
ya correct
mm
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
ah so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
um you see
ya I mean mean of of course
mm
mm ah ah then after that
ya
ya
wah I think ah I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem

okay
so these days
to design more
ya I think I want to I need your help
so ya
because my Instagram shop is not
progressing at all
I don't know
hobby is hard I want to try new things you also want to try new things right
oh I think
that's that's the first step lah then even after that
all the materials lah because you know starting a new hobby is always so expensive but it's always been my interest and actually now is my passion ah
ya but I think if we want to do we can find a time then we join this course together you know there's this thing that this um school
yes
you can just start lah you just go for it just invest a bit of money on like necessary items
ya
mmhmm yup
that's why we always feel like oh no we can we can apply what we know and we can do so much ya ya

asians into that show I mean like they are not chinese they are not even chinese because got ken ken jeong he's korean then got the awkwafina
orh you asian you can join this show like that ah
at what to what extent is the diversity
mm mm

uh huh
type casted uh that's what it call right ya
he handsome ah that handsome guy
oh my god he's so handsome
ya
uh huh
okay
uh uh
it's funny
yes
ya
ya
ya
no ya ya ya ya I think in general
okay wait it's always not all
ya
gender ah we are very different
what the shit
oh sorry
you don't have to
like female discrimination discriminatory uh ya
if you cannot look past my curse you cannot look past my tone of my voice then you you you not even looking at the problem at the first place
oh my god
but then
uh what about the things we have you know
but then I've to watch when she watch then I like oh no that's so bad
oh this is so bad
ya and and they have a lot of shows because they are very funded their arts is very funded I mean look at K pop
something that singapore cannot achieve
really ah I don't think they will ever

mmhmm
ah ya ya ya I remember her
mmhmm
oh really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
mm I'm not so sure I think you can do some uh admin job duties I know in my workplace uh sometimes we have um we need we get orders from customers for bentos or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to uh hire someone for the time being especially during this period lah
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
mm I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay hijabis not uh not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this um poll lah uh asking whether like have any of us malay hijabis ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset lah like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
oh
mm
wah
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry uh for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab err restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried oh let's say what if the medicine or anything like
and I think in social media it has been blowing up ah but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay lah ha
aww
it's not fated man
what
there's better men out there so don't worry about him
why
ya
err what what what does that guy do is he working or studying or
oh
ya ya ya
oh my god I hate procrastination
the day before the day when oh my god
at four o'clock
oh my god mm
oh my god how dare you make a girl wait
oh my god
huh what kind of guy is that
huh
then how do you exist
ya lor might as well just don't pray lor you leave the religion I mean it's a bit extreme lah but
I don't know how to say this it's a bit of a sensitive issue
mm

I don't know man I I used I mean I don't have guy friends but then now that I already graduated I don't really talk to them much and they are also busy with I just don't talk to guys in general
I feel very awkward with guys
though I mean like I do talk to my male colleagues lah but I mean I think that's different because I already know them so I'm comfortable but then in terms of this kind of matchmaking thing I awkward lah you need to understand I'm single for twenty years okay
oh really

I don't like bowling I don't like I mean I don't like sports but I like exercising but I don't like sports it's two different thing

the way I kind of broke contact with him was a bit harsh lah because I remember at that time we had another block visit then after that he was like messaging me late at night I think it was around eleven plus so I told him oh err I want to go and pray first lah then he was like okay after you pray text me ah then after that I ignore him already
I feel so sorry for him

close one eye lah eh
I can close one eye lah it is up to you lah you want you want that okay lah fine lah
but please do not disturb my
pasting on the wall please
then you think I like it when you want to paste all your frames

two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus ah something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
why cannot
if I'm not wrong there's a
uh
price for it
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
mm
mmhmm
then say lah you put your price like that what
you advertise five room mah
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot what
one one five
mm
aiya cincai lah cincai lah

I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
mmhmm
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the one that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
mm
wow you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself lah
they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm
oh my god
mm mm
mm
mm
ya lah
born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home lah
ah fully on music then
work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with err graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday ah ah
you design tau like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
ah
hmm
um
but you know what uh I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
zoom or ah microsoft teams
oh she is uh in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
ah work from school even internship eh ah ya from home I mean
ah so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work what
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that what
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then um
actually diff races okay lah
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma ah outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
oh my god
oh you mean secondary school or what
oh primary five then I still in the kindergarten lah
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay ah
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true lah
eighteen oh ya
hmm
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days leh
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
uh ya so even the teachers know that ah anytime like they had to
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious lah
like to be honest for me right
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like err for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then um
for that grade I got a
then um
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in uh
poly diploma in uh arabic private school so
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
oh oh ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard ah vanguard
oh
oh
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
ah because for my primary school like
like they like
ah separate into our six six
I don't label myself as antisocial
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group ah
oh she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
oh oh okay okay
oh no
oh
then issac was six
oh primary six oh oh but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay

ya okay
so
um not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
portrait malay portrait of you
oi if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
um cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at uh one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really um
check and um keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
wah ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
mm
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
and if if this is like a uh continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games lah bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please lah muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that eh she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
ah see lah all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted mah so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts ah denial
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy lah so it's fine K stop oh shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
um
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit lah bro like
ya ya you have to
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
huh okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive what
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya lah if never take care lor
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon lah
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
ah sorry lah it's fucking sus lah it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no lah for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like oh that's why we ah got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting what right
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck oh my god
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one ah
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
hmm I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app lah correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's amin which guy
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
is there drama now with you and amin
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive ah listen ah okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me oh I'm talking to this fella um
and then after I say okay um
how did you meet her
and then after that oh through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
uh fate eh that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
platonically as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already what then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect meh to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and ah if you want to talk about F uh ah friends friends I got a lot of friends lan jiao lah must be one of them must be your date meh
like you don't have any workmates meh you don't you're not motivated in life
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no lah it's bullshit lah if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it meh
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit eh if let's say you went out with this fella and with
syafiq the one that you never date what amin syafiq okay so amin is the one you date before
so if you went out with amin and syafiq okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you ah eh just break up ah
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit eh like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
eh I got talk to her before I got date her before oh now she talking to that guy ah
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
mm ah you mm ah mm mm
because you are you trying to say that oh he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya lah me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this syafiq eh no akim guy akim akim you need to just
play your game well just say lor like
flirt to text not to sext
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so ah shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be eh he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten what right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K chao
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go what
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating mah officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using ah but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say ah people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart lah for me for me is like
at least have the sense of um intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that uh you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
eh eh uh no if I were you
for me to find out more red flags
so
wah
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one ah like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine eh if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird what it's fucking weird bro
I'm not trying to uh anyhow to do ah but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
oh so his relationship was like three years ah
with the first girl
kiwek okay lah
then he got single then he dated that girl
uh huh
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no lah with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
oh so she state it when
okay okay then
correct um so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
um
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up ah bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this uh this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch mah
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
then um
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
um uh asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch what you should know the criteria what as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain what because if you don't get the girl then shut up lah so
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded tau you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than uh if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
um uh how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like oh fuck I'm a malay I cannot eh shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird lah unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame what like
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
did you know what I'm saying
ah so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording ah
they need to type ah their to
ah transcript huh portrait copy paste copy paste
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
chao if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
in jail eh say once I get past my O levels I will marry uh and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is what I used to what that's a fucking pattern what you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards ah but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
oh whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot lah because not twenty twenty vision mah put braces mah my eyes
they lie people lie
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
oh maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking um pursue a better goal
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn uh like maybe because
how to say ah when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say ah for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
uh dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like oh you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
um like I have a lot to work on but
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
cause he's fucking fat wah fuck you chibai want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up ah want to look at my boyfriend for what
buto I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
oh anytime if I want to cut you off which is good lah I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping ah
mm mm
correct so
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck ah
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work meh
ya isn't that good
huh
but then
ah that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick lah huh looks and also um
not status looks and um body language
when that is okay then after that your your
uh no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
mm test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this uh and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner uh uh toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
but you reciprocate
uh
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt what right so when

my day um
then the queue outside to enter is so long cause right now is COVID right like you know
so the maximum number of people to be inside the store is like only twenty five
and it's black friday so
people like trying to get in so even if I tell them uh I'm sorry lah you cannot
then they just keep doing the annoyed face
but the I'm just saying ah not not not really good not a good day how about you
like I see everybody is like shopping black friday's sale so good
hmm good question
then you where where was where was your intern again
oh that's your interview I mean like when your intern start
oh cause I got part time school and
holidays is not holidays already
revise and get all the projects done
but this time is infographic but
it's better it's a group project so at least
me
mm I think I'm just like cause right now I
then but for you you I thought you studied like
mm cause right now it's not
easy to get accounting job with uh like
maybe I try to apply if I get if not what I'm just going to go maybe just administrative work
but
overseas
oh my god if COVID is over
just like
of course like I miss most is like the different
like currency you know like anything it's just anything and everything is cheaper there
like it's in singapore you know the everything is much more expensive so you can't spent that much
you have to be like save save a bit
um I don't really
have a favourite like
but I know you're more into fashion kan
so actually how about you just tell me like actually what kind of like
fashion you're into right now
like koreans are known for their skin
you know like their clear skin
and it's like actually cheaper to buy there is cause they they sell it like in bundles and like there's always promotion on their items
but I but like they are also known for their fashion but I didn't like I'm not into it so I didn't buy a lot of like their shoes or like clothing
so it was like wasted lah I I didn't also visit all their
attractions much
I'm sure you also have a dream
country to go right like what is it
wah
you like anime
wah what anime you watch already
favourite anime
mm like currently I like I find haikyu really cute like I've I've like keep up with like from season one to season four like
but thanks lah actually this kind soul actually introduced me to anime I just started I don't I don't like really
know about anime but after watching it like I've grown interest into it
mm I think it's more on like
like you know school
that kind of anime ya
I don't like the one like you know
there's one I don't know there's one kind of anime I don't I'm not really into it but
okay lah but I like anime like it's like in cartoon
cartoon but more on
in things that actually happening in real life like that's the thing like make me fall in love with anime
mm like I said I like haikyu so I'm actually into like kenma
like he's like really chill guy
ya like he was like a simple guy but he just like inside he's always like bursting so at certain time when he
instead of being quiet he he just like get angry that's when like he but he looks cute like I find it cute
ya
it's okay lah anime is like a way to like it's a getaway from like real life
hmm before anime actually I used to watch K drama like you know K drama
oh eh you heard already you never watch it before
like
mm I think I watch mm like
most of running man episode
like you know running man like be when kang gary was inside
like I don't like they are different already lah like is not the
the running man that it used to be but okay lah I still watch I still keep up with them
but you eh
hello
what year is that kang ho dong inside two days one night like now
uh K pop oh ya K pop is what makes me when into K drama and all K pop
the first thing was actually feel in love with jeong eun ji
just made me fell in love with her
favourite song from who
orh if A pink like no I listen to most of their songs like I just keep up with all their songs
there's no like favourites lah actually because all their song is nice very catchy
oh no no lah I just found it inside my wardrobe
like what is even the difference between soccer and football
huh food mm I'm not so sure lah a thing about me is I don't have like favourite favourite thing like
I like I like I don't like I don't like
like I don't know I don't believe in favourite
why you have is it
me
mm
I like I say lah like I
eat what add stuff is it
oh it's not like I don't eat
the go-to is sure McDonald's lah
oh ya talking about samurai burger right now they they they bring back samurai burger wah I was so excited during COVID cause usually they
bring out in like mid
of the year
like because of COVID they have like McDonald was close
so now that they open it they bring back samurai I was so happy like I think I ate it twice already this week
but if like their menu
I usually go for the angus burger
it's like a upgraded version of cheeseburger like you how about you what what is your go-to menu at McDonald's
at the end of the day I'll still go for like home-cooked meals
Jollibee oh my god Jollibee is a Jollibee is a filipino
fast food right
Adam's Corner
Adam's Corner
oh you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
wah
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there lah cause more of nature so many insects
I um my sister she used to lah she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong lah
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like um afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school haiyo
huh
wow I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try lah try to be on time lah it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school err this year april
so it's only been how many months
uh few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
hmm looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so lah
then eh you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
oh
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
mm I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
wow then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
uh that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
uh no I take care of myself very well
um like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay lah since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
oh really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
oh good lah
hmm nevermind lah
like
right now oh you heard about like
uh I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
oh
it's okay lah we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
uh I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good lah you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
wah I really I like oh yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know uh
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
ah every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
oh wah everything you want to do with your friend ah then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
oh uh you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
uh government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure lah but like what it can be use for
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
wah talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like uh allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim oh uh have you like you know uh sentosa also there's a lot of like
uh activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
uh oh I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
uh trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because uh apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same lah
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
uh I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you lah
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try lah I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
wow that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands huh
wah then what's your favourite car
but I'm just not into it like you know like
like there's interest in car no I like car I mean it
I can sit down it gets me to places with shelter
oh then you watch tokyo drift ah you like japanese car
oh the fast and furious movies is it ya actually tokyo drift all uh
is it is it too fast too furious or the fast and furious one oh I think just anything before that is nice but after
I don't like not really into the show lah
way before what don't so text me just saying you watch the show when there's paul walker
so when there's no paul walker you don't watch it anymore
nissan skyline
oh I think I heard of that car before
wah but I don't know lah I I'm I look so weird by myself like I don't have like interest
but it's weird you don't know like people always have like will be interest in cars interest in bikes
or interest in like footballs and all
ya I'm amazed that like
wah so you have been supporting that club since you were three years old
wow
I feel like that's against your will
but it's okay I guess you learn
you grow to learn the eh eh you learn to grow
hais
english is hard but it's okay I think you love your club already but is your club really good actually or you just love them
but is man U still as good as they were
wah wow
but I know lah like I like I used to hear like man U is like good but now
I don't really hear much about them anymore so like
I don't know anything but it's
cool to know lah from you
true lah you also cannot expect all good players to go into man U right of course you have to give chance to other teams to bring up their name also
are you being an haters right now like maybe right now it's liverpool time to shine
hmm interesting wow
wah I feel like wah I'm not looking forward for work tomorrow like
uh ah I also just want to relax and really just watch something I like
true
hais
nevermind I think we just have to endure a bit
get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
is it
rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
mm mm
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
uh like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay lah let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us
okay
it's really nice like talking to you all about this like

um I heard lah I don't know whether true or not
ya recently like very small cases lah ya
ya because my my aunt also she
now uh alternate between like one week in office one week at home so at least I think that's the not that's the best idea lah
you know

I
oh
I don't like to order

nice food okay because

um ya lah then it's like when as I choose it always have to be a halal food then our halal selection quite limited so I'm very sick of the stuff that we order in already
so ya then then
ya but then if I'm eating at home then like
they will know what I'm ordering and things like that so
ya
why
jurong

then I want to find another industry to work at
then also
ah ya still searching lah that's why I I end up
about knowing this lah
ya
a'ah ya lah that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
ah
ya lah ya lah
ah
that's why
I don't know ah what's going on also
mm depends ah
they said
mm
ya lor recently I got a job offer
um the pay is okay lah the the work scope and time also okay
ya
ah what
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you lah but ya
mm mm then
mm
mm ya usually they they like um and they like they prefer
registered people ah usually
but like
ya I
what
ya lah ya lah that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax ah
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope ah
ah
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
um
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
like they just like mood totally go down seh I don't know ah then
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training tau
then she say to me like um what ah
you come here you don't know anything uh then how you going to teach the kids
then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
ya
ya ya
ya
she said twice eh in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting what
so uh she complain to the boss in chinese
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
fine whatever just
keep quiet ah then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed lah because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing lah basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I uh obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do lah because
do okay you can quite teach lah but then
ya so that one gone ah
ya
ya lah ya lah
err
a'ah
a'ah
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
mm
ah
oh you mean ah are you like developers or
not really
oh
oh ya ya ya
wah that's interesting ah I was contemplating learning that
ya because um
upper course ya
that's cool ah
because I got media arts
um diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
mm
a'ah
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating ah so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
ya
mm suffocating
like means what
oh
I don't know eh
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone oh I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like eh actually I don't feel like going out ah then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
shiok ah like we living our best life ah but then I suffocated in a sense that
um
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
sometimes the things they do is just
ah ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy lah because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
oh um still the same also lah two but um I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird leh because um
like I'm the eldest kan
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
ya
so
barrier crossed and then
um she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree lah
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off lah ya
mm
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood ah
ya but she got the cert lah ya
no lah she working in those like F&B jobs lah
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know eh
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
law legally binding law law what you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
ah then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
mm
is it
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
um relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can um
get uh engaged and married what
oh okay that one also I don't know but normally lah normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya mm
I mean that's
uh that's from my experience lah I don't know whether
not like I got married before lah but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya oh this is how it's supposed to be ah I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
err uh um almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because uh first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous what
sorry what
whatever lah you know ya ya so
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity lah I feel
why
ah
ah
mm
oh my god
ah
but uh I think it's okay ah cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
oh okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy lah then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know oh I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay lah like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
um I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy lah you
so then how huh
oh
mm
oh ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family kan but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
girl ah ya ya ya my mum ya lor that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
mm
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that lah
but so far I've been going over they quite okay leh it's more like okay it's actually um my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how lah but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said lah we both like have our own place already
and then like okay lah maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period lah
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house lah
and the in-laws house
ya
mm
ya ya
because like
I feel
oh okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say um last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
so but then she say lah like in now these days a bit difficult lah but then
her ideal goal is still to move out lah ya
but then ugh
like
why you don't like the the the partner ah
mm
ya the okay
eh
ask her to get out ah really ya ya ya okay dah
ugh
ya ya ya
oh my gosh that's interesting eh
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
mm okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in jurong no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
ya
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought jurong was cool like the west side you know like oh cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of yishun
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay jurong a bit dodgy
a'ah
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of jurong
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
wah that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
mmhmm
yes it's true
ah
mm
oh ya ya that's right
mm
hmm do you like that or not
okay
mm
oh
those are touch and run away kind ya
ah
ah
ah
mm
a'ah
the what you do
what the
ah ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
watch group wah your parents also very ons eh
ah
oh
mm
mm interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
ya but I don't think I can be like you lah
like the last three times uh people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
uh
more like like I think too well of myself
ya
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me ah want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it ah like what you say ah
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
empty kan
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
ah ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door ah
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya oops I cursed
ya lah ya lah so I'm just like oh I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
most of the not most of the jobs that I want lah but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no ah ang mo kio also got industrial park lah but that one is different industry
but ya
I mean not easier lah it will be
mm ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
um ya
would you rather town or tanjong pagar
it's a bit far for me
uh huh
ya
I cannot lah I I just for me I feel I get
mm
ya
ya lah ya lah
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
ugh
so it's damn irritating
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
ah I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons lah pros and cons
mm
ya
I don't know ah I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan kan like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID lah so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that lah like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
mmhmm
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
mm
obviously ya
interesting
ya lah ya lah such is life
my plan
a'ah
but I think he don't want lah
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long eh like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said lah he still need a teaching degree
then I'm just like wah that's very long eh that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that lah
a'ah
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that lah
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
study jer but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job ah so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me lah sometimes I wish I just have a nice uh rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
uh you lah
uh qian jin is a

the first zoom is telling us ah what are we supposed to do blah blah blah
and then after that ah they ask us about it basically they overview of everything
and then what are we supposed to do our job scope
and then after that they say okay within two weeks ah give you we will email you your training dates
so I had to wait two week
for our training week no it been one month actually

and then after that training date two weeks later exactly two weeks later is the
the

I was at home
start already technically start already I'm being paid ya
ah okay babe
prorated lah so now until thirtieth
but the the pay is like mid base month
ya I don't like that kind
ya one month lah
ya
so meaning next month I work that whole month right and then after that
the in january then I get the pay the mid jan
ya I don't like that kind because is
my sister said is because of the government sector
ya
that's weird
I mean your
earlier hmm
my barber shop
also the pay is

what pay is this
like how did you even
no lah the cut off date is one month
debit ya
then the in between the one to fifteen is all next month pay
like that ya so need to reshuffle your
spending and everything ah
ya that's why my my
my phone bill is end of the month gym is early month
hello is Fitness First
Fitness First

the the
deserted
and then after that the second one the third one is buona vista because currently buona vista has three
around there
there's metropolis there's fusionopolis there's another polis
ya
from ya under underpass
err office

when is the time

nowadays ah is one eight zero eh
the monthly
their monthly membership

no then mine is one three six then my cousin one is one five something
I think but my one was
mine is
got promo
ah
the promo ended already because ah you sign up with a insurance then you paid a little bit then you get this price
but it doesn't add up one eight zero
ya
ya then is then because my friend say like join GYMMBOXX or anytime fitness then I was like huh anytime fitness is like what eighty eight
mm
not that I
I been there once and then but I just don't like
like very
the weight is not is not the same
uh huh
because I started with my friend what and then after that he trained me and then stuff like that then after a while then I get the hang of it I guess
then I also watch video

F forty five
I
really
oh ya
oh ya you join already

I did the trial way before you join
no because is expensive I have to paid member I mean I have to pay lesson and this one
it was either all so I just take the gym but
F forty five is a shit
oh ya because
like because everybody is like
you are new
then everybody know each other and then ya and then like but it depends on the centre itself like my centre is jurong one right and then is family oriented-ish
no no as in how they mix around is very family-ish
and then after that they will go round
then like okay let's go let's go let's go ah
huh
oh is it
F forty five
is she fit
maybe she got background
which outlet is this
interesting

ya that's why I like like
or how about you apply ah gym receptionist

ya that what I
is working there as a receptionist I guess

then the funny story is he got a job
ah
that day I I accompany him at holland eh not holland V err
where ah tiong bahru
for interview but he don't want ah
via zoom lah
then no because actually he cannot do the interview at home because the house is very noisy so he ask me out

interviewee something ya
that he doesn't have background and everything then he say never mind we can help you err we can guide you and everything there but when when he went there nobody guide him
so everything like basically he sat there
ya
then
ya
no
that's why then like he went to the toilet he shit thinking about it he come out bye bye
that one I don't know ah
but I think that might as well ya
oops

but technically speaking if he comes back to you after two years right I think you would have moved on sia
I think you would have moved on already
like now you're in the process
for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that
ya
ya
ya
mm
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
oh my god
astarghfirullahalazim

izuan is like
he came into the picture later exactly

lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
he talks to humairah about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say oh I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
ah
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope sia

maybe in the future maybe will
ya exactly
ya lah
she got cheated

he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing but
I mean ya you're kind of fast lah but
rather than him might as well you go for someone else right
ya exactly
you're right

straightaway the answer legit would you like to
would you like to have that
that that has been my conclusion all my years
you know that mirah tell me you know like okay
oh okay okay sorry then we were going home right
ah
then after that she asked me like have you had a boyfriend before
that was like somewhat close to
uh dating ah
then he told me

okay no I'm I'm not stereotyping lah but
I mean isn't that
she told me that you know umirah
she said she knows that some
the guy bought
kan
can you imagine if I tell izuan that
I say that
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
kan
ya sia
oh huzni texted you while we were talking that one
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
I'm just saying ya
ya
ya you I look at you then after that I was like thinking
what the hell
ya the one he said when you were what what made him talk about it ah
ah
I mean it's your opinion on what you wear what
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
eh you wah shit sia cannot sia like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked husni you know
like it's way before
and then err suddenly you say
then he
okay that one was okay I understand he say that
that is nice if he said that
ya I told you ya it's yesterday
then after that I obviously I um
err
then after that because that irfan guy right he commented he
he talked to me about my picture
the one that I put
ya
because it's all black you cannot see the shape
oh so so like what's the problem it's just one line
if you
if guys also do that we can see what if I ask husni to do husni also have what
mmhmm
about what
she wasn't inside what
she wasn't inside what
ya
kan like what's what's wrong with with what I wear
ya it's supposed to be worn with sports bra
ya exactly
mm
just go about my day I'm I'm just gonna ignore everything that happened yesterday bruh

wifi
you know some even the some of the girls right
that I know from when I went to china
I go to china

up to you ah you want to wear it or not

a'ah
that's the thing okay about romanticism kan okay there's
is quite
toxic ah is when you
that's why there's this research ah woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
a'ah
a'ah
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
more than me
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want ah
overthinking ah ah but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this ah
one she's alone overseas
romanticism
and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
happiness is happiness by itself ah
cause you don't compare yours with another people ya
like okay
but it's more of like
for where I am now even now I'm making money like like huge money ah
okay that's my success
I quite happy sia with what I am with what I have
thirty seconds
yes
yay

okay I started recording
okay ya can
so later on today you are going to go for the other um what do you call that focus group
uh huh
amirah amirah from ah oh oh
how do you know I mean how do you know she's going
ah
ah oh
mm
what mmhmm
wah
ah
ah
a'ah
oh
ya
ah
I see
wow then that what then ya I mean if you didn't enjoy the show then you have to give them the feedback lah like oh I couldn't sit through
ah
a'ah
lah
ya
oh my god
syarif syarif malaque eh oh okay
I see
ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the
no
ya so it's like err I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
ya that one was quite interesting
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to oh okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says ah which is very true everything is on demand
ah
oh my goodness
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya
oh ya what finance
oh yes yes yes cool
oh a partner
oh err wait
oh true true true
ya then I will find a partner
let me try my husband
oh
ah ah ah
ya
haiya if like that then
like that jannah and I meet up lah to do it
then like that there's no issue about it right
ya can also then it'll be like a meetup hangout
ya
sounds good
ah
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
uh huh uh huh
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
oh okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house what
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
mmhmm
ah
ah
I don't know but ros also
oh like you yourself okay
mm mm
mm
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole lah also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
huh
a'ah
ya
what oh no but eh five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya lah there's your savings
dope okay lah hundred plus
okay eh then okay eh not so bad eh hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan ah is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
mm
mm mm
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus lah
mm
ah ah
ah
ah
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from kan
ah okay okay can lah
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
oh no
mm
mm mm
mm
wow malay and higher malay
ya
nice
you know why then everybody else is just happy lah they they don't but but I thought aini has a full time job
aren't you keeping in touch with her I thought you guys were quite close right or
oh okay okay
mm mm
oh no
oh dear
that sucks
a'ah
ah
a'ah
less than one hour was it a full flight

that is precluding
huh then what
mm
mm
you told him that
that you don't want to get married without a job
okay
ah
ah
ah
like da da da and
actually I think can what
as in like as in a green light
you you won't get retrenched firstly cause of your seniority and then secondly
I don't know I mean if he this this would be the perfect time to see if he if someone can support you lah through difficult times kan
but I think it's just you lah you just want to you know make make sure that everything is perfect before you enter any serious commitment
ya now I have to try and change my earpiece
cause it's running out of battery
ya it's very annoying
so I hope it work
inshaallah lah eh now where is my
earpiece
I think I should borrow hidayat earpiece
eh there
cause this stupid google pixel a'ah google pixel
so every week at least one night he will stay there
ya
so I have I have some time to myself
my mother-in-law my mother-in-law wanted hanan to like stay over so we just do it lah
okay
okay
how about wait ah we pause for a while
okay let me try again so now I'm attaching my earpiece in
okay ah this is another wireless earpiece
please lah work please please
okay
okay good good good
ya so I will get
ya correct
I'm very lucky already still want to complain about my son I think about sending him all the time
crazy ah
he is I don't know I think he is
ya he he has his moments lah but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed tau
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock lah you know by the drawers you have to ah pull out and things like that ya but hanan figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied
that is wishful thinking
okay lah
eh can you hear me clearly
okay good good good ya this earpiece is a lot better than that stupid airpod keep running out of battery lah
I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct
I can even
this is xiaomi
it's only twenty dollars
unlike the airpod which was like what three hundred
ya I think he's buying I want to buy this type too
I already got the job lah
like I mean you know they they like like on the website like I've already been rejected from all the other applications
but one is still open like still pending pending approval so just wait lor it is what it is it takes a very long time
ya and I really want that job though
ya but ya lah I'm also scared but at the same time
for the position is
it's compliance manager
ya
so I hope they pay well
yes yes jannah was the one who suggested yes
ya I was quite surprised also
she should go
ya
she should go cause her sisters also going
oh my gosh
but her sister got degree
oh oh oh
okay
mmhmm
mm ya
mm mm
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
eh actually you don't need lah you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya lah
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that lah but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya lah a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at then I feel it's really worth it
that to me ah
and then they teach you
ya lah around there lor
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three K
eighteen months
actually okay what right
eh but come
ah ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
you know
but now you realised that hey actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what I mean
ya
mm mm
there is there is
no of course there's going to be a very good reason to get married
you
ya
ya ya ya it's a perfect size and width
mm mm
okay okay
ya mmhmm
ya
like I would go and save and look for couple massage and then buy right
but he splurged like five hundred plus okay then
ah
okay
wah
okay okay
a'ah
a'ah ya like the what the wave okay
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah nice and where did you guys go for dinner
nice
as in ros booked the restaurant okay
mm okay okay
mm
so he cancelled the other one
nice pretty nice
aww so nice then what what you packed
like you packed like the clothes for the day
huh
cute seh
you know I trust him now
that's good that's good
ya
which is I mean to be fair also it's hard for him lah how is he going to talk somebody like robert right who's been in your life for so long
ya slowly in future to your family
ya lah I know
what what what about him does she wish would be better
that's good lah
there's a I do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay lah just let them live their life
you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interfere
then after that he's like why you so rude ah I don't want to go lah then he called his sister and said oh I'm I'm not going already then I have to go lah I went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and hanan
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited seh they want to go out with hanan
hais
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see lah inshaallah lah and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee lah like um you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me lah they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
ah
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me lah I told his sister lah the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
ah ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
hais
ya lah this is
eh you know that used to be me but now I'm like haiya I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for hanan right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually hanan is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work what
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also lah but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like hidayat will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya lah but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now um next week ah
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
huh I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
hais
ya
the only one for a long time
oh my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at furama err this girl is from she's doing ah I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
ah
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
nazreen is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister lah they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause nazreen works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at so you imagine
huh serious
serious
mm mm
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit lah so in the end
ah
as in like okay lah
eh but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
mm
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family lor
right if it's fifty your aunties and uncles already dah fifty people plus your cousins
ya
oh my god then you have to do another wedding for the other side
huh why I feel sad leh
it's as not
okay
but do you feel want to be like someone's wife
do you still want to be like a wife like wedding aside
okay
I know I know there are just so many things
ah
ya
as in now what next
ah okay ya you should really take it slow enjoy being fiance fiance
you know I I was just listening to
I don't like the way they talk
on
ya no don't don't even bother I tried giving them a chance it just makes my blood boil
ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with aisyah his girlfriend aisyah aziz
it was okay lah but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like oh you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows what his girlfriend is aisyah aziz
like hello
oh mm mm
ya
ya correct correct
and the chemistry is just not there right
like
mm ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is dzar who carries the conversation right with the
people like razz will
a'ah
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually dzar can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no lah
din doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that oh okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least dzar has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya
ah ya ya correct correct
ah ah ah like what's the point you join right
can you hear me
ya I listen to CAPAW
eh it's already one hour five minutes

kind of disrespecting ya but then no lah so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
oh my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns lah how is it scary we are oh my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand lah they don't have to also
if not just ask us lah about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay lah explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary wow
like all those wannabes
mmhmm like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
I can be any anyone lah like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
like I don't really mean that you know like I I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference

uh huh
ah ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
it it was moving
like you see the arms and all
ah ah ah ah ah
dishes
ah
oh oh
but you know if you think properly
you are blocking them you know
then the way you shout is obvious that you saw one thing
no
uh
ah ah
oh
hello
mm
okay the master bedroom toilet okay
ah
correct correct
ah
hey
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to not
turn away from it
I saw you first
train
wah until now
until time ah
no but like at that point in time ah
oh
whoa
wah so weird leh
anabelle
oh shit
that one dig out the eyes
mm
ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
at the side table lah
okay when you say that there's obviously something
one last ah one last
ah
wah irritating ah playing around
ah
ah ah ah
correct correct
whoa
wah
short eh
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task tau which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is lah but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
like you what me you what you want me to do like
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
mm mm all the way down
ya so like the the part where
uh
ya like
ten O two
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
ya maybe so
with me
then there will be two of us correct
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say ah
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
uh you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so lasiri was sleeping
there is a scientific reason for all that what
then
when I say cannot ah will say no bro
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer what so she went to this one guy
hey bro
how you know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like eh maybe real siot
kan
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
uh ya same
and then they'll be like
hey
come ah fetch me at my place ah hey cheebye after you tell me all this you want me to fetch you at your workplace you okay or not okay

kallang way
so they have like korean they have everything japanese
and they follow okay two veggie one
meat three dollar eighty cent
cheap right they really follow the economy style
downside is it only accept cash
ya
uh then ah old chang kee accept paywave
ah
I think what
cause
got waffle also then I just feel like I want to
no lah
how the heck are they going to fry the waffle
wow
wow like the double down something like that
mm not bad
waffle is swensen no no the thing is I cannot with swensen
the food is not great the service is low
I cannot ah swensen is just so meh
I would rather
you put me at pizza hut
rather than swensen
choices ya
oh
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
oh
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
uh uh
the bread is the sourdough
uh it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
uh uh
uh pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very very very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
wah means you reach work swee swee sia
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know lah every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace ah that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
oh then you can walk
you quite smart hor
I've never thought of that leh
wow
shit
okay

so fathul I have a question for you mm if you have three wishes what are err what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would err void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say um by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things hmm maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants lah
mm and some skills that I want to have err maybe include err having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world ah
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily err to us to some people to live happily is to have err the money and the wealth
err so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy ah and intelligence also ah this is to me I think it relates to me also ah because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
uh so maybe for now we move uh to the next question which is err superpowers fathul what err if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
ah eh
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of ah the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you err by accident
the the
the amount of err infection or the possibilities of uh infection rate ah you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk uh ambitions that I have
or maybe uh I I can take risks without having worrying that I might uh injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe err get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win ah
provided I am strong ah and maybe with this regeneration
hmm
I can donate let's say some parts of my uh limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
hmm where I have this ability so I can do is err I request my leg to be cut off and then give away err in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard uh tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
mm what do you think about this regeneration ability
mm it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having uh to be looked at or without err being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
hmm I have this
I want to be uh isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self ah to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems uh affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
mm
how long maybe until I feel peace ah so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months ah but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months ah then slowly maybe I will
err increase the number of the period ah slowly
hmm
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable lah
but it has to be looked in a certain way ah whereby the person
err
he is not affecting badly uh around the people uh uh he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state ah
uh
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot lah so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small err goals small err
small achievement so this child will live without uh having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife ah he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife err agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free ah to do anything that he wants
do you think so
eh
uh cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
err
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary ah but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams ah
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart ah
mm so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self err I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self ah
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
mm and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
um what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos uh I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and uh an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud lah or maybe just email yourself ah so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
err a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself uh since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is err I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see err how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe err start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
mm
K
you maybe you next we should talk about um near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was err I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was uh stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall uh is when I was
err riding bike uh it happens maybe due to
err rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to uh overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next uh topic that I have in mind which is err a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
uh ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
hmm whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that err there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
um synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example uh few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
err I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future um a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go uh deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took uh I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on

what course
mm how long again
one year
you gonna leave me for one year girl
wow really
like legit for the rent of the house
ho four thousand
uh ah
okay what actually quite okay
a'ah
but can you in countryside I'm gonna work
probably probably
I'm thinking to asking for an upgrade to a senior so ya hmm yes
one year that's my one year yes
I planning to change to
I have not think of that
cause if I were to change job I have to I'm planning to go back to school study ya then if you think if I want to change
no lah if to think long term you see this COVID I'm still working
if I don't
infant or childcare indicator yes
so if childcare I have to go back study
but
to think of the money as well
ya lah but see lah how
mmhmm
so it's over there but okay lah I think it's quite

ya that thing then they can deduct so after deduction I think you can just pay like a few hundred
by the age of twenty five I want to get marry girl
and I see lah you see lah I work continue health care until I get pregnant
healthcare you if you until pregnant the benefit is good
um that's more benefit
if not then
um ya true if not
then I will see lah if my pay still the same no increment no ya not like
no increase in anything then
find new job lor either go back admin

she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
uh
so she don't have to move
whoa but then she got to study law
filing
admin is a good thinking back then
you need to think a lot ah ya I want the two years experience and then see how

now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done uh last one is done lah
okay if let's say right for me ah if I plan eh sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing ah better don't plan just go you say like you will say uh if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle lah
ah that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust lah each other have their own trust
then just go mmhmm
okay
ah
okay I guess correct ya
hmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
okay

um very straightforward what you want the colour
the wording
and the address already in detail and just let them design it you know what happen on that time
it's like they asking a lot of question like uh
this one uh did how to say eh they did ask a lot of question about the design we said this one want to be very simple we we we're not like fussy you know I was very simple we give them a sample already but they still do the wrong things eh
malay to malay you know I don't know how what language I want to say also not sure so this is the funny part but the funny is only one time you know lah the the next time ah I mean the next round I mean the next uh I ask them to redo again then the face change you know

they they actually translates from malay to english ang mo kio and correct the that's one of the reason why you don't want we don't want to take them on their we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day I was so fed up I just and then they cannot give me anything like I say you nevermind

err save money kan I think from your resolution to eat healthily and to grow your own food you can actually monetise from that
maybe you can make YouTube channel
how ya how you how you grow your own food from scratch a'ah then we'll see how it grows then from the products that you plant then maybe you can make a channel uh on how to make your own vegetarian food
ya
mm mm
mm
err want it to be
I want it to have plot twist
in a good way
after twenty twenty one eh twenty twenty one ends I have then one hundred percent that I will reach
yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup that's nice
because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student eh ya I was still a student then
err I have my student life which is very interesting
I
um I involved in so many social program clubs and all
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs lah which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
err more me time
ah I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time ah
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that ah
I want to enroll in piano class
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not lah not to be like professional guitarist lah no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was err in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard ah and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
mm mmhmm
ya
ah
mm yes I think that is one of the reason kot for the shift in preference to
hmm maybe
but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
uh I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first lah
mmhmm
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm
oh is it I don't know about that but
um
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
err instead of english
mm mm
this is good for my networking lah
mm mm
err and
I remember that
err I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
err sadly only one language is err permissible for for for a student err we can only choose one additional language to learn
japanese a'ah

ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
