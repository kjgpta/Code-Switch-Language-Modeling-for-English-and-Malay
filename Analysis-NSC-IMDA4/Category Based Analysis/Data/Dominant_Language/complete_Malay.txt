it's not I can choose and go right
good luck [lah]
<malay>dia dah dia dah</malay> twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty <malay>habis itu</malay> twenty <malay>dia</malay> twenty one [eh] twenty
<malay>habis</malay> poly
you say he year three right
ya next year april right
you graduate
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one <malay>dia</malay> enlist or twenty
let's say <malay>pergi</malay> twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three <malay>dia akan keluar</malay> twenty three <malay>baru keluar</malay>
<malay>itu pun kalau dia</malay> straightaway like okay after this I do this after this <malay>kalau dia macam nak</malay> stop <malay>sekejap nak kerja</malay>
because if you want to go uni with I think (uh) working experience is better
one or two years
but
no cause that [one] is right I think is <malay>kalau</malay> I don't know [ah] I think because I [oh] is masters masters then you need that [one] to two years of working experience
ya
mash mush
if I'm not wrong bachelor is
bachelor is the degree
[eh]
bachelor is before <malay>ni</malay> [kan] before degree right
(hmm) I think so I don't know I not sure maybe master degree then is degree then degree is bachelors
LASALLE or NAFA is a uni [meh]
ya I thought is
you should join before before poly my friend <malay>dah masuk</malay> NAFA now
never even go poly
[oh]
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but <malay>kena kerja</malay> one year
he singaporean also he have to <malay>kerja</malay> one year and <malay>tak pergi sekolah</malay> for one month
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kata tak dapat</malay> then he work starbucks for one year <malay>baru</malay> work
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia suka</malay>
(hmm)
some more <malay>mak dia tak nak bayarkan</malay> he have to pay himself
if your parents pay for you then okay [ah] if not because he say like quite quite ex
okay
okay let's say if your is actually good would you go for do you think you want to go for poly [eh] poly uni
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh yang</malay> she study and she's good at it also it's good [lah] because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your <malay>gaji</malay> is two point five then if you enter with a degree your <malay>gaji</malay> is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know <malay>macam</malay> two point five <malay>abeh</malay> maybe after two years later your boss <malay>naikkan gaji</malay> two point seven two point eight I don't know
no [ah] it's considered but for a start it's considered a lot
but for
my for like my course is not a lot my course (uh) starting for diploma is three point two
ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
so is <malay>kalau</malay> I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two [ah] if I go for a hospital
that's considered a lot [ah] like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay [lah] enough [what]
no five K one person
but that's not bad [what] you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay [ah]
so they add up together <malay>dah</malay> seven K seven K is enough
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
but like I think for comfortable life <malay>macam betul-betul</malay> comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
I think something right starting another business [sia]
(uh) no it's the same (uh) like food but then another another shop so like she <malay>buka</malay> same shop
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tahu</malay> [kan]
like I tried [lah] like my mum own cooking at home <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] <malay>takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap</malay>
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing [eh] like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help <malay>aku macam</malay> I don't like [lah] this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister <malay>itu semua untuk buka</malay> this kind of shop
ya you know <malay>yang kedai yang</malay> <malay>ni</malay> she actually wanted to
[oh] ya you actually wanted to <malay>tutup</malay> the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back <malay>pasal</malay> her her work workers <malay>macam tak bagus</malay> her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
like six [eh] seven to three [jer]
so it's not like very long hours
<malay>otak kau</malay>
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
ya it's just like that I mean <malay>dia punya pekerja</malay> like the food standard is always <malay>macam tak</malay> constant <malay>sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap</malay> that kind
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
my mum pay monthly four K <malay>orang semua terkejut</malay> [sia]
<malay>dorang macam</malay> how you make money here then <malay>mak aku macam</malay> (uh) cause my mum she smart [lah] in business she smart in business she just put everything <malay>macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua</malay> [kan] then they just tell people then she just put on her <malay>barang</malay>
so she just take everything and just put <malay>macam</malay> no matter <malay>benda tu orang nak ke tak</malay> just put [lah] like <malay>kalau orang nak beli</malay>
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K
ya then like
<malay>tapi</malay> because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum <malay>takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai ni mahal</malay> [sia]
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this [one] you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill <malay>kena bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri</malay> then aircon <malay>dalam tu macam rosak gitu</malay> so cannot feel
ya (uh) <malay>tak dia</malay> repair but you know the thing is <malay>kita tak ada</malay> aircon [ah] the aircon <malay>macam tak boleh rasa</malay> then <malay>abeh</malay> you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
<malay>pastu</malay> engine <malay>dia</malay> keep trip [ah] <malay>macam dia punya mak aku</malay> my mum say can only open like two switches at a time <malay>abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat</malay> like two switch at a time <malay>kalau nak panaskan</malay> it's like very <malay>lambat</malay> [kan]
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip [kan] <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> for like thirty minutes <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> [tau] then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
but
what the hell two switch <malay>abeh dah</malay> [lah] <malay>mahal abeh kau cakap buka</malay> two switch
<malay>merepek</malay> [kan] then <malay>mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kedai ni</malay> then after that my mum <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] to leave the <malay>kedai</malay> [seh] like like the <malay>kedai</malay> then after that my dad already <malay>dah tukarkan</malay> the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad <malay>dah tukar</malay> we can open all the switch already then it won't trip <malay>bapa aku cakap</malay> they use the wire <malay>yang</malay> lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire

but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then <malay>kedai dia selalu tutup</malay> my father always go saturday <malay>tutup</malay> sunday <malay>tutup</malay> then my father <malay>macam apa ni</malay> business <malay>macam mana nak buka ni kalau</malay>
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
<malay>pasal dulu</malay> it never close you know
<malay>mahal kedai tu</malay> is like you know that time they asking from #sara# for twelve K a month
for that shop
ya #sara# says #sara# told me last time I was close to her <malay>juga</malay> [what] last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw <malay>macam</malay> #sara# <malay>punya kedai</malay> always <malay>banyak banyak</malay> queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing <malay>macam</malay> you are trying to benefit from people <malay>punya</malay> business
<malay>kedai lain semua dah tak naik</malay> tank
is cannot [what] cause that is the person's shop [what] <malay>kalau kau</malay> it's either you stay or leave [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave [ah]
you imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kedai sekarang ni yang</malay> that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
and like <malay>apa</malay> the shop obviously the shop owner <malay>dia sengaja nak</malay> #sara# <malay>punya</malay> father <malay>keluar</malay> that's why <malay>naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti</malay> #sara# father cannot pay then surrender the shop
<malay>kedai tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] that's all you know
cause they always <malay>keluar gi</malay> malaysia all this together
now <malay>dorang ni ke</malay>
they are at home [what]
is either at home <malay>biasanya dorang masak kat rumah</malay> then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy <malay>ke dorang</malay> both at the shop
that's why they
<malay>sekarang bapa dia bawa</malay> grab [pe]
should be business <malay>tak cukup</malay> or like they have a lot of things to pay [ah] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> [kan] the business very good
then after that <malay>sekarang dah tak bagus</malay> then the father <malay>ambil</malay> car <malay>abeh ambil</malay> motor <malay>berapa banyak biji</malay> motor <malay>dia nak</malay> then the father buy for the <malay>kakak</malay> the <malay>abang pun</malay> all motor <malay>abeh sekarang</malay> business <malay>dah tak bagus</malay> how then he have to grab [ah] <malay>bawa</malay> grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish [what]
<malay>kena bayar</malay> so it's either <malay>untuk aku</malay> your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
<malay>abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak</malay> how to afford
same
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>bapa aku tak kasi</malay>
<malay>kau berani naik</malay> motor <malay>macam nasib kau</malay> #afiq# <malay>ada</malay> motor [kan] <malay>nanti dia</malay>

<malay>abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau</malay> [kan] #safi# <malay>nak naik</malay> motor <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>kau rasa mak kau kasi</malay>

<malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau ayah aku tahu mampus</malay> [sia]
like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital
(uh) ya ya
<malay>itu yang aku takut</malay>

don't you think so like with COVID like !wow! where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling [eh] do you miss travelling
ya but if (mm) you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to (uh)
(um) like before COVID [lah]
new
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!
[eh] so was the first time that you felt snow or <malay>macam</malay> how was it [ah] <malay>macam sejuk gila ke</malay> or like how was it
[ah] K
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester

this was towards the end of your trip or <malay>macam mana</malay>
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] <malay>takde duit apa</malay> [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean

did the taxi driver actually buy your <malay>alasan</malay>
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he <malay>kena</malay> switched on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter [ah]
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because I'm just wondering <malay>macam</malay> you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm <malay>tengah</malay> panic [eh] <malay>pasal macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat</malay> then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
<malay>macam macam</malay> what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
<malay>ada raih tak kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] spain <malay>menang</malay>
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like <malay>habis</malay>
people will probably be like <malay>maki-maki semua</malay>
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] <malay>kena jalan balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>jalan balik lepas tu</malay>
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] <malay>roti</malay> and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
<malay>prata</malay> [eh]
<malay>prata</malay> is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait <malay>sabar sabar kau orang dah</malay> check <malay>harga benda tu ke belum</malay>
okay okay <malay>habis</malay>
alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]

hi
hello how are you
okay okay
okay beauty in everyone
(mm)
(uh huh)
okay okay
(uh) definition of beauty [eh] okay
(uh) personally I think I don't have any good looks
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners <malay>adab</malay> [lah] <malay>adab</malay>
what about you like what's your definition of beauty
(mm)
(mm) insecurities
(mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) okay look before <malay>kita</malay> start [kan] (um)
okay like for you do you think beauty
(uh) okay <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] (um)
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me (uh) I I see as a short term thing
so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana</malay>
ten years down the road <malay>bila kita dah</malay> ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think (um)
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example friendship [lah] <malay>macam kita nak buat kawan baru</malay> [kan]
would you would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
(um)
okay
(mmhmm)
true true true
attention ya
(mmhmm)
(um) true true
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(err) <malay>tahu tahu</malay>
#inshaallah# <malay>tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm) like
true true true
okay (uh)
okay okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] because <malay>poli poli aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (um) define
(uh) for my course okay because my course
my course <malay>banyak</malay> cliques [tau] then (um) in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation [kan] so <malay>macam apa aku</malay> observe [kan]
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is <malay>dia orang</malay> popular and then they are
they are very loud
ya they are very vocal [lah] then and they have good looks also so
<malay>macam</malay> for me (uh) in my course most of the cliques <malay>yang macam</malay> the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people (um) they
they are closer to people that <malay>macam ada</malay> good looks <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
ya fashion wise also [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
(mm)
ya true
(um) ya true
so it's very very subjective [lah] in terms of <malay>macam mana dia orang</malay> select (uh) friends and ya and how the friendship last till
ten years down the road ya
(mm) true true
yes
competition
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(um) okay
(uh) for working life [eh]
I think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so <malay>macam</malay> teaching <malay>ke</malay> (uh)
ya design <malay>ke ataupun</malay> like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
it depends beauty <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya (mmhmm)
(err) yes yes
ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(um)
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
(uh)
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain (uh) like <malay>macam</malay> for example for female right they like males <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>lelaki yang ada</malay> certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
(err) yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
<malay>aku rasa macam</malay> are we talking in like first first
first time impression or
[ah] okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh) I think will be mindset slash personality wise
(um) like <malay>kau nak</malay> share
(uh) okay okay
okay (uh) okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset <malay>sebab macam</malay>
(uh) for me I place I I put more I mean <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] my first first
how do you say it <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would (uh) my first check list is like mindset or personality so <malay>macam</malay> ya because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>apa kita macam</malay>
we are into only the good looks then like I said <malay>macam</malay> in <malay>apa</malay> ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so <malay>macam</malay> to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> mindset and personality so <malay>macam</malay> personality and mindset is something that your bring (uh) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] it's like since <malay>yang kau dah ada</malay> personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset (um) like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] what (uh) your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods (uh) rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality <malay>macam</malay> like for example ten years down the road [kan] <malay>kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita</malay> when you have your children then like if you
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
(um) intelligence
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(err) you groom yourself [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay (uh) firstly <malay>memang aku ada watak</malay> a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly <malay>macam</malay>
if we if you were to put me in a room where there's a lot of like pretty pretty like girls and or or we we are we like the most most like insecure person [lah]
ya that
(uh) <malay>memang</malay> high <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>dia lebih lawa</malay> [lah] [ah]
I hate
(uh)
(mm)
ya okay the
(uh)
okay no before
before we go to the next question I want to ask <malay>macam</malay>
okay okay best <malay>ke dalam</malay> topic of friendship [kan]
<malay>macam kau rasa</malay>
friendship <malay>bila kita buat kawan</malay> (uh) <malay>buat</malay>
<malay>buat kawan</malay> for the first time
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
(mm)
(mm)
subjective [lah] also
(mm)
(mm)
to me (uh) in terms of boys or girls I would say girls <malay>sebab macam</malay>
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like <malay>macam</malay> their
practical they're quite practical
<malay>macam</malay> the friendship is base more on <malay>macam</malay>
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly <malay>macam</malay> I mean
not to generalize [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like boys they generally talk about like
(uh) <malay>apa macam</malay> like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
is
(uh) ya
comparing ya (mm)
ya better
(mm) ya should we move on
(mm)
beauty standards is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
yes
(mm) suicide
(oo)
(mm)
(mm)
ya I think (uh)
(err) yes yes
(uh) yes
(mmhmm) yes
(mm) actually for that topic <malay>aku pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>belajar</malay> [lah] in <malay>aku punya</malay> course if like
(uh) if there's a term
(uh) if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional (um)
ya dysfunctional (um) (um) ya so it's basically like the society is not
<malay>macam</malay> what we think is a society it's not like (um) good but then it's still functioning so
(uh) it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the (uh) beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
<malay>macam</malay> is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something [lah]
rather than to have a society that <malay>macam</malay> everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of <malay>macam</malay> they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
so I think ya
yes yes any ya any competition also
ya yes yes yes
ya I'm not really sure what's the term [lah] but ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
any any drive to move forward

(uh) no I don't think in the long term you be as successful as the one who have (uh) experience and skills
fashion
(uh) ya
(mm)
yes yes
<malay>lain macam</malay> extra
(mm)
okay (err) then our us okay about the fashion thingy right
(uh)
okay so now
let's move on to the fashion side so ya okay so for fashion like
okay so for fashion (um) back in those days <malay>macam</malay> nineties eighties [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> the fashion do (um) I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion (mm)
(err) yes based on pictures also [lah] then yes it's very laid back and <malay>macam</malay>
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true <malay>tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> the fashion trend you know so <malay>macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut</malay> and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now <malay>macam</malay>
we have like the (uh) what the term E-boy E-girl then the (uh) then the what type of new dress <malay>macam</malay> hipster hipster so <malay>macam</malay>
I know you know I'm
(mm) hipster
ya just to fit in I would say
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay>
like do you think the
the no (um) the fashion <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
<malay>macam</malay> is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so <malay>macam</malay> do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
okay okay can can can
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] yes social media
(mmhmm)
pinterest
tiktok yes yes yes
(um) yes
(mm)
(mm)

just to fit in yes
(mm)
(mm)
(err) okay
(mm) it's the influenza
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] <malay>pasal</malay> journey is it
[oh] I know I know (err) if you want to go [eh] if you want to go far you go by yourself something like that ya
(mm) yes true
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
rethink
okay so (uh) okay this might be out of topic but
you were mentioning about like (um) like okay it's not really related to what you said but I think there is some relevance but you (um)
<malay>apa tu macam</malay> (um) right now (uh)
they society sees one sees an individual who is always alone
as someone who is below below societies (um)
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (uh) so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is <malay>macam kau ada banyak kawan</malay> then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> value [lah] then <malay>ada macam ada tempat dekat</malay> society but someone <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>dia macam apa seorang</malay>
then <malay>dia macam pentingkan</malay> not really <malay>pentingkan diri</malay> as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care [lah] so like what what you think of like (um) this society standard <malay>macam</malay> ya
like being in a big group is deem as (uh) your offer value rather (uh) offer value and then for someone who is who is (um)
who is individual who is alone
(uh) seems (uh) society deems them as (uh) the weaks (err) yes the weak ones
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(um) ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
yes yes
yes ya
(mm) yes yes
(mm)
yes commitment
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true true true
(um) okay personally because I am an introvert so it will take me very long time it will take me very long time to open up to new people [lah] especially so
our first friendship is yes yes yes
it will take a lot of years right
ya
that was <malay>jodoh</malay> [seh]
(mm)
we friends or what
seven no six set to I think you know two thousand fourteen
we <malay>ngam-ngam</malay>
it has been
roughly six years [kan]
ya
ya no beauty no standards
ya
ya
true true
(mm)
and I think for our friendship also (um) we are not that judgmental like in (uh) between ourselves so <malay>macam</malay>
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and <malay>kita macam banyak</malay> advice each other so so like it's really something
ya (mm)
true okay
ya friendship ya
okay should we move on to the next question
okay (uh) okay so we have this task like
the negative side there's (uh) society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself [lah] since beauty was so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada okay (uh) <malay>ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung</malay>
it could !aiya!
(mm)
they got the face and the attitude right
(mm)
yes #mira filzah#
(mm)
yes yes
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) so it's like full package [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good looking very humble also
but
but I heard okay so that one is (um) <malay>macam kita kirakan macam</malay> (uh) role model <malay>yang macam</malay>
someone who is (err) so <malay>macam mira filzah dia macam</malay> actress [kan]
western [eh] (uh) <malay>aku tak berapa tengok</malay>
(uh)
western actor or actress
(mm)
yes yes
(um) mostly character
ya
ya
yes yes
(mm) okay then for <malay>ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam</malay> (uh) <malay>pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam</malay> in your own
<malay>macam</malay> those not as
those not popular [lah] so <malay>macam kawan kau</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> or like someone
you like within your family I don't know
(mm) like who who is like
a role model to you obviously
<malay>yang macam dia lawa</malay> and very like <malay>lemah lembut</malay> and all
(mm)
(mm)
(err) ya
#neelofa# isn't #neelofa# like malaysian
[oh] yes yes
(mm) yes
(mm)
(mm)
yes
it's something <malay>macam</malay>
ya it's something also like I think youth nowadays
motivation [lah] yes
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> (uh) [kan] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
deen and deen and dunya so <malay>macam apa tu</malay> dunya means like world [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dunia tak di akhirat</malay> [lah] so
(mm)
so <malay>macam aku rasa macam sekarang</malay> like <malay>budak</malay> I mean not to generalize okay but like <malay>budak-budak sekarang</malay> is more
ya like now more of like world
<malay>aku rasa macam sebab macam</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world [lah] instead of like the the (uh) afterlife
(mm) so like I
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those <malay>yang macam dia ada dua</malay> [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> dunya and deen
yes
(mm)
(mm)
(oo)
yes
yes yes
(mm) true true
(mm)
so like more <malay>macam</malay> be comfortable in your own skin
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya sure okay so <malay>kita tinggal</malay> like a few more minutes [lah] so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
so like about beauty you want to share first
regret [eh] [oh] okay
(mm)
okay so <malay>aku</malay> start first [lah] so regret <malay>aku</malay> is to be the beauty standard so <malay>macam dulu</malay> (uh) secondary one primary six <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> very (uh) very insecure [lah] <malay>sebab macam</malay>
<malay>kita ada</malay> influence <malay>dengan</malay> K pop <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>macam kita nampak</malay> !woo! <malay>macam lawa</malay> [seh] and <malay>kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua</malay> I mean <malay>kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam</malay> (uh) we are not there [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> ya so like what I regret was like (uh)
like <malay>aku terlalu pentingkan</malay> like <malay>kecantikan dari luar</malay> instead of <malay>dari dalam</malay> ya
(mm) so what's your regret
[oh]
I think it'll be conflict or selfish [lah]
[oh] yes
true true true
(um) then <malay>jap</malay>
ya
like I think message something like to to remind you during your <malay>apa macam</malay> (uh) <malay>bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat</malay> [lah] I would say
so (uh) for me five years ten years down the road
(um) the priority will be (uh) <malay>ke</malay> (uh) work live and
I think pressure in terms of like <malay>macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam</malay> marriage [lah] so I think
(uh) my message to be (um)
I think the pressure will be more <malay>bila kawan-kawan kau dah</malay> start to slowly get married so <malay>macam</malay> you'll feel very pressured so (um) my message would be (um)
to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want [lah] instead of doing something that the the people around you
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause <malay>macam</malay> to to to learn to prioritise
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
(mm)
so ya

<malay>apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar</malay> (uh) <malay>kanak-kanak yang kecil</malay>
<malay>kira kakak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak</malay> have the skills <malay>untuk</malay> cope with this problem
<malay>dengan adanya</malay> technologies <malay>sebagai telefon bimbit dan</malay> tablet <malay>adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita</malay> around ten years old <malay>ke</malay> eight years old <malay>gitu bila tak ada komputer semua</malay> or <malay>bila takde</malay> handphone <malay>kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita</malay> time <malay>kecil</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak dulu beza</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab dulu kita takde</malay> netflix <malay>takde</malay> youtube <malay>kita cuma tengok</malay> live and live <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> if you want to go to the toilet <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> advertisement
then remember last time you have to <malay>apa nak kena</malay> rush the toilet <malay>kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat</malay>
<malay>sekarang senang</malay> [jer] now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it [kan] like how did we survive last time like <malay>kalau</malay> you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit <malay>susah tapi</malay> like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
like there's only one computer in the house then <malay>kalau</malay> if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so <malay>kakak</malay> remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way <malay>macam</malay>
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at <malay>rumah lama</malay> that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya [oh] what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should (uh) and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor

not that good
meal [eh]
meal <malay>tu apa makan apa-apa</malay> [ah]
[oh] overseas okay I got one that I remember
[ah] until now I <malay>pernah makan</malay>
whale meat when I go to japan
<malay>itu</malay> that is very memorable <malay>apasal</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> whale meat <malay>yang paling mahal sekali</malay>
actually <malay>dia punya</malay> whale meat <malay>dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis</malay> [jer] <malay>dia potong</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan</malay> #ramen# #ramen#
<malay>dia punya</malay> japanese version <malay>punya</malay> #ramen# [lah] then <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>selepas tu</malay> first I thought <malay>macam dia punya</malay> <malay>dia punya</malay> portion <malay>dia</malay> is quite big [tau] <malay>besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih</malay> too little
[oh] it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause (uh) it's not #sashimi# usually <malay>orang jepun kalau kasih</malay> #sashimi# <malay>dia akan letak dekat</malay> a different plate
but this one is cooked (uh) but not like deep fry <malay>punya</malay> cook [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think steam or what [lah] cause
<malay>dia letak</malay> on top of the #ramen# itself so we must eat along on the #ramen# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay>
condiments [ah] basically <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> seaweed <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually (um) the most unique [lah] <malay>paling</malay> unique <malay>sekali</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay>
restaurant is actually located outside #meiji# shrine [ah] <malay>yang pasal halal</malay>
<malay>tak halal tu</malay> actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese <malay>punya</malay>
restaurant [kan] once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>babi</malay> or any (uh) meat stuff [lah] even <malay>ayam ke daging ke apa</malay> so once they sell <malay>barang</malay>
seafood is purely hundred percent just <malay>barang</malay> seafood [jer]
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
okay okay <malay>yang itu paling</malay> best okay <malay>yang dia punya</malay> whale <malay>bila makan</malay> it's [eh] <malay>dia punya potong</malay> slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
[lah] put inside my mouth it just melts <malay>dia kira macam makan</malay> butter <malay>gitu cuma rasa dia</malay> is <malay>bukan</malay> butter <malay>rasa dia</malay> is <malay>lemak tapi bukan lemak macam</malay>
<malay>kambing ke lemak</malay> [ah] no [tau] it's just <malay>lemak</malay>
but you just taste the sea water so <malay>kirakan</malay>
<malay>dia rasa betul-betul macam</malay>
<malay>lemak ikan</malay> and whale <malay>punya lemak</malay> is really one of a kind [ah] it's really !wah! if
the taste is really unique [lah]
<malay>kalau awak pernah makan</malay> <malay>macam</malay> sea urchin <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat <malay>itu itu yang</malay> very very very unique
<malay>yang orang tak pernah rasa</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak pasti isi</malay> or fats
but (uh) mostly it's I think fats [ah] cause <malay>kalau isi</malay> whale [kan] is a tough [kan]
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats <malay>yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut</malay> even fats <malay>kambing</malay>
<malay>ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti</malay> melts in the mouth
[ah] so that is the thing and <malay>lagipun dia punya</malay> I think <malay>dia potong tipis-tipis</malay> [lah] so I can't really
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best [eh]
actually <malay>takde yang</malay> okay compare japan korea [lah] <malay>kita jangan cakap pasal</malay> thailand
thailand is <malay>dia punya makan</malay> just <malay>semuanya pedas-pedas</malay> [jer]
(uh) japan <malay>boleh tahan</malay> (uh) but japan <malay>punya makan</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay>
<malay>bukan tekak orang melayu</malay>
<malay>yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu</malay> is you know what (um) <malay>makanan</malay> korea
cause <malay>makanan</malay> korea even <malay>dia punya mee hitam tu yang</malay>
<malay>orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same as <malay>kita punya mee rebus</malay>
yes #jajangmyeon# cause <malay>kita punya mee rebus semua</malay> the difference is #jajangmyeon# is <malay>macam dia macam basah-basah</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same <malay>macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah</malay> and of course <malay>kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap</malay> cause why <malay>kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi</malay>
and <malay>ada telur ada apa</malay> so <malay>dia orang punya</malay> is a mixture of japanese
<malay>punya</malay> taste bud <malay>dengan</malay> mix with into <malay>mee rebus punya rasa</malay> that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique [lah] quite unique <malay>tapi yang</malay> I really like about korea is <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi#
<malay>itu</malay> I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas</malay> enough <malay>ialah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>pasal pasal daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>tu</malay> you imagine <malay>macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan</malay>
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate !fuh! <malay>lepas tu makan dengan nasi</malay>
<malay>nasi biasa nasi panas-panas</malay> [eh] steam rice <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you <malay>takkan rasa jelak</malay> I mean according to my taste [lah] cause I really like the <malay>daging</malay> #bulgogi#
to that extreme yes
yes I've tried #wagyu# beef <malay>yang halal punya</malay> actually we have
until <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) A three <malay>ke</malay> A two usually <malay>halal punya</malay> #wagyu# beef there's no A five <malay>yang tak halal punya iya yang</malay> A five cause (um)
<malay>yang halal punya</malay> is actually (err) it's only made in australia
<malay>yang</malay> the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself [lah] <malay>yang halal punya</malay> is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five <malay>punya punya apa tu punya punya</malay> grading
[ah]
no the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
the the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan <malay>yang yang</malay> [ah]
<malay>lembu-lembu ni yang ada itu</malay>
the essence of #wagyu# beef [ah] <malay>yang banyak</malay> marbling it's also I heard there's also a
a special kind of breed only for
for the #wagyu# beef <malay>punya itu</malay> [ah] market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five <malay>yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya</malay> the rest of it is a usually (um)
<malay>tak</malay> (uh) no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia <malay>punya</malay> is (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay> grade not that high [lah] but <malay>dia punya rasa</malay> okay [lah] actually okay [lah] the thing about
(uh) #wagyu# beef is just that <malay>dia punya lemak</malay> [jer]
<malay>yang</malay> if you if you really notice [kan] <malay>dia punya yang urat-urat tu</malay> is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the <malay>lemak</malay> fats is the same
what makes it different is that <malay>orang jepun ni dia punya</malay> #wagyu# beef <malay>dia suka potong</malay> raw
<malay>makan macam apa tu</malay> the #sashimi# [eh] then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that #umami# effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
<malay>ada itu</malay> #umami# <malay>punya</malay> effect #umami# effect is exactly like how you
eat <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
#ajinomoto# <malay>dia</malay> that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the #wagyu# beef
(uh) <malay>dia punya lemak-lemak dia</malay>
ya
[oh] like I say just now [lah] I only eat #bulgogi# cause that's to me is the best of the best <malay>paling sedap</malay>
the #bulgogi# is really my got to [lah] I've eaten <malay>orang makan</malay> thailand <malay>makan</malay> indonesia <malay>melayu semua</malay> I just like #bulgogi# cause #bulgogi# <malay>pun kira macam-macam</malay> [tau] a different part of korea <malay>yang halal punya</malay> they make different type of #bulgogi# the one that I really like is the <malay>budak-budak yang bikin kat</malay>
#itaewon# the #itaewon# actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain [ah] it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up (err) that hill
that hill <malay>daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua</malay>
<malay>makanan halal</malay> from singapore from malaysia
turkey <malay>negeri</malay> arab <malay>semua ada</malay> so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque <malay>nama dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tak apa-apa nama dia</malay> is is not it's a <malay>adalah</malay> I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
then after that if you go down
okay cause <malay>dia pun macam</malay> road [kan] so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small <malay>macam</malay>
(err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] you know like those kind of arab street <malay>punya</malay> shophouses you go [ah]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> you go then <malay>adalah dekat situ</malay> [ah] actually <malay>yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu</malay>
they are malaysians but the way they cook the #bulgogi# is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the #bulgogi#
a lot of them and also there are other specialty [kan] it's actually <malay>ayam rebus</malay> and <malay>dia punya ayam</malay> it's actually they take the whole
<malay>macam</malay> spring chicken <malay>dia kasih</malay> steam <malay>itu benda</malay>
and <malay>dia rebus kat dalam</malay> the chicken soup the chicken broth !wah! then they they just [ah] basically
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
<malay>dia tak potong tak apa</malay> the steamed chicken <malay>tu</malay> they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> one bowl of rice
!fuh! <malay>makan sedap</malay> [ah] actually during winter <malay>makan tu</malay> is the best [ah]
cause I go it's actually
not really winter [lah] it's quite cold but not really winter <malay>yang</malay> I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
<malay>dalam</malay> minus
twelve [ah] minus twelve <malay>yang paling sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu yang paling</malay> best [kan] <malay>kat</malay> japan on the new year's day new year's day <malay>pagi-pagi bangun</malay>
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal [lah] I I actually go down
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> snow <malay>dia punya</malay> snow is <malay>tak banyak</malay> must wait for the night time then we go to the
nearest park then that's where all the snow is [lah]
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> you go cause #tokyo# [kan] is <malay>bandar</malay> [kan] so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields <malay>dekat yang pokok-pokok</malay> [ah] then you can take the snow from there
very interesting
(err) truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather cause singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather you can only expect two
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
<malay>punya</malay> weather [lah] like (uh) autumn
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> spring [lah] winter
cause why for I mean for own
livelihood [lah] I mean <malay>tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah</malay> <malay>berapa besar</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah</malay> <malay>kita</malay> then <malay>lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk</malay> weather singapore <malay>sendiri dah</malay>
<malay>dah banyak apa lagi kalau</malay> imagine <malay>kita kena simpan</malay> for
winter clothings <malay>lain</malay>
autumn clothings <malay>lain</malay>
spring clothings <malay>lain</malay> summer clothings <malay>lain</malay> so we will [ah] take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal [lah] that is for me [lah] but unless it's [ah] you are
talking about we are living in japan <malay>negeri dia besar</malay> even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there <malay>dia punya rumah sana</malay>
<malay>murah-murah</malay> and actually it's freehold [tau] it's not <malay>macam kita</malay> lease
ninety nine years is freehold <malay>rumah dia</malay> is actually very affordable
<malay>kita punya rumah</malay> three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized <malay>punya rumah</malay> in japan freehold
and !wah! I tell you the
<malay>punya</malay> scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area <malay>macam kita punya</malay>
<malay>tempat</malay> [lah] #hougang# #ang mo kio#
<malay>kita punya</malay> you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right <malay>kalau dekat jepun</malay> you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban [ah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> heartland [ah] <malay>kira</malay>
is all <malay>rumah dia</malay> is all (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> bungalow bungalow bungalow
<malay>lepas tu yang ada tempat ada</malay> gate <malay>yang ada tempat tak ada</malay> gate but mostly <malay>tempat dia orang</malay> is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
okay in japan [kan] in a middle of
<malay>dia punya</malay> village <malay>dia</malay> is actually a farm
<malay>dia akan</malay> farm is actually <malay>itu</malay> farm <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>jepun punya beras</malay> [kan] <malay>lain</malay> [kan] so basically all the villagers <malay>dia akan</malay> (um)
<malay>apa tu</malay> have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right [ah] until modernization come [lah] but that farm itself right <malay>untuk kalau</malay>
<malay>nasi</malay> basic <malay>punya nasi</malay> is actually more than enough to feed the whole
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of [lah]
so even until now also there are still people but not young people [lah] the old people [ah] <malay>dia orang tua-tua yang</malay> [ah] mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right (um) <malay>yang paling</malay> best <malay>kita orang</malay> tourist they let they let us enter
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive [lah] but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
cause <malay>dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english <malay>yang</malay>
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english <malay>pun</malay> is actually
broken english it's not really full (uh) <malay>punya</malay> english the language that we learn (um) from our
school [lah] cause (err) frankly speaking in asia right
[oh] <malay>budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>kita punya</malay> english is one of the highest grade [lah] <malay>kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa</malay> english in all of asian <malay>punya</malay> country even if you go to like
russia even china you know <malay>apatah lagi</malay> malaysia indonesia <malay>ni semua</malay> their english level <malay>dengan budak</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> level
is really <malay>macam langit dengan bumi lain</malay>
really far [kan]
[ah] so that is the gist [lah] actually
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> for japan <malay>tak</malay> (uh) it depends on where you go <malay>kalau itu tempat</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay> hundred percent muslims okay usually <malay>macam gini</malay> even if you go
to any other country <malay>macam</malay> thailand even #bali# or what [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a <malay>dua dapur</malay>
one <malay>dapur</malay> is for the halal the other <malay>dapur</malay> is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they <malay>ada dua dapur</malay> for those pure
muslims usually <malay>yang macam</malay> if you go japan is those
<malay>orang kita cakap mualaf</malay> [ah] <malay>orang jepun mualaf ke apa</malay> [ah] they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the <malay>dia punya</malay> sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually <malay>kalau macam kita punya</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> MUIS
[ah] so they also have their own <malay>punya</malay> MUIS [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those (uh) restaurants <malay>yang</malay> mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think <malay>dia punya</malay> rental <malay>dia punya duit</malay>
<malay>sewa dia</malay> every month is very expensive so they need to cover [lah] they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive (mm) korea <malay>jepun</malay> all the same even #bali# even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop <malay>dia punya</malay> area
hundred percent halal they won't accept (err) alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting [kan] that's what I when if you go around the world then you see [lah]
(mm)
correct correct correct is like that one
that's how they live their life I mean <malay>untuk kita kalau macam</malay> extra <malay>was-was kita jangan makan</malay> but you must we must know that there is actually two <malay>dapur</malay>
it's not one <malay>dapur</malay> they make they mix everything together no no no two different <malay>dapur</malay>
(uh) so they have the alcoholic
actually they <malay>yang</malay> the alcohol <malay>pun</malay> it's not really <malay>dapur</malay> [lah] it's just <malay>macam</malay> a bar just a bar place
for them to to you know to do their things
[ah] so that is the gist [lah]
(err) cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty [ah] but since <malay>kita pun dah ada banyak</malay> options <malay>sekarang</malay> so (mm)
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy [ah] but again [lah] like
(uh) what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much [lah] <malay>kalau macam dia cakap buah</malay> avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday <malay>nanti</malay> you get other complications when you get when you eat <malay>benda yang</malay> is too good everyday is no good if you search
into youtube [kan]
there's this <malay>guru</malay> from india he say garlic is the best (uh) medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
(uh) have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> (uh) <malay>cara perubatan</malay> really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> treatment they all use garlic
[ah] yes cause garlic is very good [lah] basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
<malay>apa tu</malay>
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy [eh] I
healthy
fruits [lah] I eat fruits [lah] but (uh) if you want it
okay [ah] usually fruits [lah] I just eat fruits
<malay>itu aje</malay> the most the most healthiest <malay>yang</malay> I eat
[oh] almost everyday is egg [lah] by right egg is is considered healthy food [mah]
skills [eh] meaning what
<malay>apa-apa</malay> skills [lah] is it the the the
hardware <malay>dengan</malay> software <malay>punya</malay> skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether <malay>nak jadi apa</malay> I say I <malay>nak jadi kaya</malay> [kan] so
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code [lah] code very very well so that I can build
(err) games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine [ah] you <malay>dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja</malay> eight to five
or <malay>kerja</malay> shift or whatever
<malay>untuk cari nafkah</malay> you straightaway have an app
and that is your business product [ah] after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
cause <malay>sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua</malay> they
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in <malay>negeri macam kita ni</malay> singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause <malay>kita punya negeri</malay> [ah] is the hub for education so if we have the right skills <malay>kita boleh bikin</malay> product from that skill
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
(uh) one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
I <malay>suka makan</malay> so I <malay>kalau boleh</malay> skill <malay>untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak</malay> (um) but one thing [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>suka masak</malay> I don't like to
<malay>masak</malay> a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before <malay>dia punya barang mahal-mahal</malay> portion <malay>besar</malay> yes <malay>dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam</malay> very posh
<malay>tetapi</malay> their fusion food <malay>macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu</malay> even <malay>dengan tekak orang putih</malay> they don't like cause (um) when you
fusion western <malay>dengan</malay> asian <malay>punya makanan</malay>
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
(uh) I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants <malay>yang ada makanan</malay> fusion <malay>yang betul-betul</malay>
(err) how to say <malay>ada dia punya rasa dia</malay> is you can actually you can want to go there again [lah]
<malay>tak ada</malay>
all
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event <malay>macam</malay> birthday <malay>ke kawan-kawan nak</malay> celebrate birthday promotions <malay>ke</malay> [ah] probably
<malay>sekali-sekala macam gitu dah</malay> but for
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause (uh) again [ah]
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again (uh) it's all about the skill set [ah] if we got
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan]
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food [ah]
just say food
[oh] ya (uh) the last skill [eh] I have [eh] okay basically for me [eh] I <malay>daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah</malay> start <malay>belajar</malay> karate [lah]
(uh) I really want to have that kind of skill <malay>untuk</malay>
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it <malay>macam</malay> example karate
[ah] judo <malay>ataupun</malay> mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
karate under okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style
and okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style is actually the original <malay>punya</malay> karate [lah] which is actually
goes very deep [lah] and also very (err)
they have very rich history (uh) their okinawan
in fact <malay>yang</malay> karate <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang jepun</malay> practice is actually fake
cause <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about <malay>orang jepun</malay> it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
it's called <malay>nama dia bukan</malay> karate <malay>nama dia</malay> karate-do
do <malay>dalam bahasa jepun</malay> is a way of life even judo
karate-do #aikido#
all the do <malay>yang kat belakang semua</malay> is actually <malay>maksud orang jepun</malay>
is a way of life so <malay>orang jepun</malay> is more on to the perfectionism
<malay>tapi</malay> if you really learn the original okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style it's more of the
the relax <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# actually <malay>belajar</malay> karate like even
<malay>kalau awak awak belajar</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan]
even if you come late the the <malay>orang</malay> the instructor <malay>tu</malay> can actually still accept you but for <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
if you're late for one minute [eh] they totally banned you from the class at all
so <malay>untuk orang</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate is actually <malay>untuk orang malas-malas</malay> (err) like myself
actually <malay>orang</malay> okay the main difference between #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate is this <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to (oo) (oo) <malay>dia kira itu dia punya</malay> how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by (uh) contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think [ah] <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate is by contracting their body
<malay>untuk kasih badan dia</malay> tense
(uh) cause <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> what they learn from
#aikido# judo <malay>ni semua</malay> if you
tense your body means you have more strength but by right #okinawa# the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
(um) you can practise the real okinawan <malay>punya punya</malay> martial arts [ah] <malay>punya ni</malay> karate cause even
<malay>dia</malay> they call this <malay>macam kita</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia bunga-bunga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita punya silat bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>orang jepun pun ada</malay>
(err) <malay>orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> is a
<malay>nama dia</malay> #kata# #kata#
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okinawan <malay>punya</malay> #kata# is actually more
realistic more relax and more
practical <malay>tapi orang jepun punya</malay> #kata# is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't (uh) focus about <malay>dia punya</malay> feel
actually <malay>ini</malay> karate <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a <malay>budak yang belajar</malay> okinawan karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm <malay>budak</malay> #okinawa# they will win cause <malay>orang jepun</malay> they also learn #kata# but <malay>dia punya</malay> #kata# and karate <malay>dia</malay> they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause <malay>untuk orang</malay>
korea <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>orang</malay> korea <malay>punya</malay> the way they fight <malay>bila</malay> when they practise
#kata# it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
but <malay>orang jepun dia punya</malay> #kata#
the stands <malay>dia punya kuda-kuda dia</malay> is
to charge at the long distance
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original <malay>punya</malay> martial arts fight is for
to fight the short distance
you ask them to fight each other <malay>yang</malay> long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan <malay>punya orang</malay>
come close to japanese <malay>punya</malay>
karate <malay>punya budak</malay>
<malay>dia akan</malay> blur <malay>dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin</malay>
[ah] that's why when they have the any competitions
okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate will always win japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
but the big but [eh] <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# even though they are more relax <malay>dia punya</malay> gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
#okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan] every class only maximum ten to fifteen people <malay>yang belajar</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya guru dia</malay> they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>lama-lama</malay> is dying out
but japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class <malay>ada dalam</malay> hundred people
two hundred people <malay>tiga ratus orang belajar</malay> in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they do not know about okinawan the original one
[ah] and also in [ah] in japan <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they are trained not to use any weapons
but by right the original karate <malay>yang</malay> from okinawan one
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use (uh) a weapon to fight
that is the true essence of okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate
[ah] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>bezanya</malay> it's actually there's a lot of difference [ah] you can talk
three days three nights [eh] <malay>tiga hari tiga malam boleh</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis</malay> cause it's actually the <malay>punya cerita</malay> is very interesting
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really [ah] do research on it
sorry again
was free
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
okay for singapore context [eh] <malay>aku nak percuma senang</malay> [jer]
<malay>aku nak rumah percuma aku nak kereta percuma</malay>
(err)
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
yes of course healthcare
cause healthcare <malay>dekat</malay> singapore <malay>yang paling mahal lepas tu</malay>
<malay>yang lain benda percuma</malay> is of course <malay>kereta dengan rumah</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal</malay>
<malay>orang budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah</malay>
<malay>yang dia orang boleh mampu</malay> (uh) mostly is that's the case [lah] <malay>lepas tu yang pasal</malay>
<malay>kereta</malay> of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
<malay>yang kau dah kasih orang</malay> lease for ten years <malay>engkau</malay> charge <malay>orang tu sampai</malay> hundred over thousand for a a normal car
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this (err)
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
carparks <malay>yang kita ada</malay> is <malay>tak cukup</malay>
I mean that is the realistic view [lah] but if like you say you ask me again
<malay>apa barang</malay> free <malay>nak</malay> of course [lah] <malay>nak rumah kereta dengan</malay> healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare <malay>dah ada pernah</malay> personal experience [ah] <malay>kalau dekat</malay> singapore you do not have any insurance <malay>apa-apa jadi dengan</malay> you [ah]
<malay>bayar</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri sampai pokai</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> insurance <malay>boleh</malay> cover <malay>sikit</malay> at least <malay>duit tu boleh cari juga</malay> [lah]
<malay>boleh apa orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>termampu</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> no insurance at all [ah] <malay>kena bayar pokai-pokai</malay> [ah] <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup nak</malay>
humans no longer
[oh]
[oh]
okay [ah]
<malay>sifat manusia ni</malay>
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
what we do okay <malay>kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu</malay>
then <malay>zaman kegemilangan</malay> islam
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the <malay>khalifah punya</malay> empire
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
<malay>dia orang tak payah nak nak pergi menanam tak payah nak pergi jual barang tak payah nak apa-apa dia orang ada macam itu hidup dia orang</malay>
<malay>ada dibiayai</malay> [lah] <malay>oleh</malay>
<malay>kita punya khalifah dulu</malay>
so <malay>apa dia orang bikin</malay>
<malay>dia orang belajar</malay>
<malay>dia belajar</malay> (um) (err)
<malay>zaman-zaman</malay> rome <malay>punya punya buku-buku</malay>
they translate <malay>daripada</malay> latin <malay>pergi</malay> arab
in fact [ah] even the egyptian <malay>punya</malay> historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why <malay>kita banyak</malay> actually a lot of our
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually [ah] push [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all the
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
(mm)
everything
so <malay>kalau untuk zaman sekarang</malay> if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing [lah] we will explore <malay>untuk sekarang lagi kita ada</malay> we are very modernize
so most likely will
<malay>kita akan</malay> explore the space [ah]
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
[ah] just [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
go to mars maybe go to venus
[ah] cause I think that is the way to go [lah] you just want to explore
<malay>kita manusia ni</malay> we we love to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
we automatically learn a lot of new things [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] repeat repeat <malay>soalan</malay>
activity [eh]
meaning what [ah]
work <malay>bukan</malay> activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity <malay>kalau</malay> activity
(hmm) [ah] eight hours [eh]
activity [eh] activity
activity
eight hours [eh]
!wah!
no no no is working out
okay activity <malay>yang paling</malay> boring [kan] [eh]
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight <malay>tak boleh</malay> cause (uh) you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight [eh] I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
<malay>apa tu</malay>
karma
ya
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> okay [lah]
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke [lah] if a comical joke easy [ah] double cheeseburger
cause why I every time I hungry <malay>kalau rumah tak ada makan</malay> I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause (err) my life how to say [ah]
it's a pretty boring [lah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] I don't do a lot of stuff
<malay>dekat luar</malay> I'm always at home so <malay>kalau</malay>
say about <malay>macam</malay> bad stuff no [lah] not really [lah]
<malay>kalau ada</malay> bad stuff <malay>mesti hidup pun</malay> I can't sleep at night also [lah]
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> not really [lah]
I <malay>yang pasal ni</malay> I can't really say much [lah] [ah] ya
actor [eh] (err)
okay [ah] actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
(um) he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
<malay>dia punya</malay> abs <malay>tu</malay> eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one [ah] also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like (err)
what troy that
trojan war troy
<malay>dia jadi</malay> achilles achilles <malay>itu punya</malay> movie okay I like two movies [ah] in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] troy so that the difference
between this [ah]
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
is actually <malay>pasal orang paling kuat</malay> achilles
that cannot be killed (uh) then after that
(mm) in the end he died he have a choice actually <malay>kalau dia</malay> if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong [lah]
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
had eternal glory <malay>macam orang ingat dia</malay>
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
[ah] [orh] even beyond that (um) you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that [eh]
any normal egoistic man he actually (uh) it shows <malay>kita manusia</malay> especially man [ah] (uh) all
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male [ah] character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this [ah] characters also this achilles
(uh) his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya [lah] and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
about this movie right about three hundred and <malay>ni</malay> [ah] troy is all the quotes that they used
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used (um) can really
make if you really into this [ah] like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful [lah] I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity <malay>itu</malay> word [eh] <malay>macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena</malay>
<malay>soal jawab</malay>
so it's it's about the same thing and also <malay>dalam</malay>
[ah] <malay>gambar-gambar macam</malay> achilles <malay>ni semua</malay> troy <malay>ni semua</malay> it's all the same thing it's their quotes [eh] you can actually bring it to real life and <malay>ikut</malay> [lah] so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out [one] [lah]
ya that's the gist
[oh] how I keep [ah] I don't know [leh]
actually I just went through life [ah]
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that (um)
after I read a book for half an hour
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
all these (uh) youtube [lah] especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it [lah]
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read [one]
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy <malay>yang</malay>
texts <malay>yang panjang-panjang semua</malay>
I don't like I would
prefer texts <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang pendek-pendek</malay> short and sweet <malay>kirakan macam gitu</malay> yes summary and also mostly
pictures and of course obviously the videos [lah] I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right (err) I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something [ah] (err) you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist [ah]
thirty two <malay>tiga puluh dua tahun</malay>
seventeen years old [eh]
seventeen years
old self
<malay>tengah buat apa</malay> is it the O levels
[ah]
seventeen
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually seventeen
need to know [ah] you need to give me a time period
seventeen
[oh] poly [eh]
(err)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually <malay>nak cakap</malay> (err)
advice
actually <malay>kalau</malay> if I look back in my life right
I don't truthfully [ah] I don't regret anything
<malay>kalau</malay> whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever [lah] I've been through (um) but <malay>kalau betul-betul nak</malay> advice of course [lah] (um)
advice [eh] okay the best thing is
[ah]
cause at that time also <malay>kalau misal kata nak cakap</malay> [oh] you learn coding you learn all these app making right
[ah] actually frankly speaking [eh] at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn <malay>sekolah</malay> poly that I learn is actually that was the
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago [ah] and actually
(err) <malay>orang yang ajar tu pun</malay> the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that (err) they are not that brilliant also
[ah] if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
so if you ask me to <malay>macam</malay> you know to start a something new I don't think (uh) there will be good advice cause
even for those like you imagine [ah]
microsoft mark zuckerberg <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] the way they start [kan] is a really is all a downhill task [lah]
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
(err)
things in life yet
[ah] so cause also <malay>apa-apapun nak kena</malay> see
your character back then when you
(uh)
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay>
so my character when I was only
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay> really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned !wah! <malay>betul-betul</malay> (uh) <malay>benda baru</malay>
that kind of thing so just live life [lah]
just a live my life that's all [lah] (mm)
!wah! <malay>ni banyak</malay> boss <malay>semua cakap gini</malay>
where do I see myself [eh]
in five years' time [eh] okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same [ah] as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married [lah] so usually is you do like that
you just be normal stuff [ah] five years' time [eh] okay <malay>kalau cakap pasal</malay> goals [eh] (um)
actually
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like <malay>macam ada</malay> have that kind of materialistic <malay>punya</malay> goals
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially (uh)
money making invention business so basically is
the coding [lah] hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it !wah! then I'll be !woo!
<malay>terus jadi</malay> billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing <malay>macam nak beli rumah besar</malay>
<malay>beli kereta besar</malay> all these I don't want cause <malay>benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat</malay> singapore we know that it won't last for cars

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
I definitely eat <malay>rendang</malay>
yes
cause
<malay>rendang</malay> actually that's a good question why <malay>tau</malay> because
I <malay>selalu makan rendang</malay>
when
<malay>hari raya</malay> but then <malay>mak mak</malay>
<malay>mak</malay> always <malay>masak</malay> like anytime she wants
so when she everytime <malay>masak</malay> I everytime <malay>makan</malay> and I love the taste of <malay>rendang</malay>
so I <malay>makan</malay> everyday [ah]
and like you know I have I've ever gone
<malay>dua bulan makan rendang</malay> straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe <malay>petang makan</malay> with <malay>roti</malay> then <malay>malam makan dengan</malay> noodle
<malay>faham</malay>
yea
ya [lah] <malay>ketupat</malay> is the best [lah] definitely
you put <malay>serunding</malay> !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually <malay>kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan</malay> noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had <malay>lemak cili api</malay> pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
<malay>sendu sendu apa</malay>
<malay>sedap je</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>pekat</malay>
<malay>sendu lain</malay> [lah]
<malay>sendu lain seru pun lain</malay>
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
<malay>macam</malay> step know it all [ah]
<malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> the big shot [ah]
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
people <malay>yang</malay> ego
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so <malay>macam</malay>
I just can't stand <malay>kalau orang nak macam nak</malay> step <malay>besar</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>orang yang nak</malay> step I really just cannot
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion [ah] <malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better <malay>lebih baik</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then <malay>hidup tak ada</malay> objective
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because <malay>orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu</malay>
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so <malay>macam buang masa</malay> [ah] <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed <malay>banyak banyak</malay> industry he <malay>dah masuk</malay> he fail <malay>banyak</malay>
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> the apprenticeship <malay>dengan</malay> tattoo artist <malay>dia buka kedai dia sendiri</malay>
at forty five and <malay>kedai dia</malay> successful
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you <malay>rasa</malay> you
<malay>dah puas</malay> with the thing you <malay>buat</malay> [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not <malay>sampai bila bila pun kan</malay> you <malay>tak akan</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> that this is the life that I want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff <malay>kan</malay> you know I did all traditional stuff
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and <malay>susah untuk kita nak</malay>
<malay>ubah pikiran orang</malay>
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society <malay>punya ape tu</malay> what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
I mean
that's good for you [lah] because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah you go first [ah] I <malay>tak tahu apa nak</malay>
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because <malay>melayu</malay> always <malay>masak with agak agak</malay>
so it's nice when it's <malay>agak agak</malay>
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what I what I I said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
I want the <malay>rendang</malay> italian
italian
<malay>rendang</malay>
<malay>rendang</malay>
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay [ah] what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it

because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange I can go into places I can look at places I can look in the future I can look in the past I can go back and do this
there's so many things I can do

work switch you know

that
that aura that I bring when I'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable
that's what I got from people
it's not something that I think I am myself

ya and and my dinner is like
in the morning I eat all the normal normal stuff then <malay>malam</malay> I just like
<malay>sebat</malay> Boost [jer]
why
<malay>macam</malay> waste of money
(mm)
okay it's one hour already yes we did it
!yay! okay bye bye
bye

K
<malay>hari kita nak berbual pasal</malay>
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
those abilities like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] kinaesthetic
[ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you want to be superman <malay>atau pun nak jadi</malay>
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> batman or iron man I would also want a superpower <malay>yang</malay>
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) <malay>dia bukan dia bukan</malay> specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until <malay>tadi sebut</malay> teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] <malay>macam</malay> harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell I forgot [lah] <malay>apa</malay> magic spell [ah]
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory <malay>yang ada siapa tu yang</malay> handsome <malay>tu nama dia</malay> [ah]
robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like <malay>macam</malay> switch on and off
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
<malay>budak-budak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita</malay>
<malay>tak faham apa yang dia nak</malay>
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
for me to <malay>macam tahu</malay> what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
I do not want <malay>macam</malay> to be burdened
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> on and off [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] I think every superpower <malay>ada</malay> burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry <malay>apa</malay>
teleportation [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
but it saves time it's very quick
<malay>cepat</malay>
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people I think people <malay>nak</malay> this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
<malay>macam kalau duit</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
<malay>tolong orang</malay>
okay <malay>apa</malay>
superpower <malay>macam</malay> okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or <malay>jaga</malay> or <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak nangis datang kasi peluk</malay> to <malay>orang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> nothing [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the <malay>mata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if <malay>naik lemak</malay>
like they <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay>
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> rich <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] work hard so we just wait for him <malay>apa</malay> to <malay>durian runtuh</malay>
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
it's something that you think of [lah] but I to me I think you know me as a person [kan] I'm not a person that wants unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that <malay>apa</malay> I respect it's just that I'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower <malay>apa ni</malay> your superpower of unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ubat</malay> for COVID nineteen like the perfect <malay>ubat</malay>
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study <malay>belajar macam mana</malay> like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay>
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
free only <malay>untuk</malay>
K the thing is I think [kan] <malay>kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni</malay> [kan]
probably free depending on what type of <malay>ubat</malay>
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore singapore doesn't give <malay>macam</malay> a lot of things <malay>percuma</malay> free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone <malay>betul tak</malay>
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
<malay>apa</malay> you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
knowledge you <malay>pun macam</malay> [meh] (uh) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
<malay>macam kena gaya</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that <malay>macam sama dengan</malay> I wonder woman
or because I can
that is just [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just <malay>macam</malay> too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
<malay>cakap bohong</malay>
about wonder
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman <malay>agaknya macam</malay> most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
<malay>tua</malay>
<malay>dia selalu sama umur habis ke</malay>
ya <malay>lambat gila</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai</malay> <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
she had to watch her <malay>kekasih</malay> die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
I think they will filming [ah] <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> stop <malay>pasal</malay> COVID nineteen [kan]
[oh] <malay>dah habis filem dengan</malay> production [eh]
[oh] because of COVID nineteen then <malay>tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok</malay> [oh]

it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I think <malay>banyak</malay> government bodies are using raffle's medical for checkup
I I expect you to go to the one at #bugis# the bigger one
[ah] that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
(oo) that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
[eh]
you have to wait equipment first [ah]
(oo) I thought they pay for you
who
!huh! you know you have a friend but you don't know who
(oo)
K never mind like I <malay>dekat</malay> I I can't recall
(oo)
you saw him or he told you are
(oo)
what you mean they have different different team [eh]
(err)
okay [lah] think can you can make it [lah]
ya [lah]
[lah] whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first [lah] while waiting for something that you used to do
[lah]
later the zoom
you do alone [eh] I I don't need to join you okay
it's so <malay>leceh</malay>
<malay>malas</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat</malay> zoom zoom <malay>ni</malay> I'm not comfortable [lah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> I keep looking at the teacher while I <malay>dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat</malay> teacher #nadia#
just like sad that her malay teacher <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>cikgu melayu dia cikgu</malay> #hafizah# <malay>dah tak ada</malay> [ah]
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
(err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is there [lah] definitely she's
the first to teach (err) #tasha#
but I believe <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
get the malay students to love
malay
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# make it more interesting
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
when #nadia# is in P three (err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# she's lucky because she knows <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# even before she started
[ah] teaching her so <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
so that's why I think it's a great loss (err) and she's there I think according to #tasha# it's like what she's only there for three years
so #tasha# was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one [lah]
(uh)
#tasha# is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
#tasha# is the first batch she teach three years [lah]
three years [eh] five years
ya initially #tasha# doesn't like her [what]
but in the end
[a'ah] see
her class [what]
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is #nadia# she pick and choose
when when the teacher she <malay>tak suka</malay>
it will affect her this what I notice [ah]
see like the I mean not <malay>apa</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya</malay> prefect <malay>punya tu</malay>
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around [lah]
because I think
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance [eh] her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her <malay>kakak</malay>
#tasha# #tasha# also [what]
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
at least she got two to her <malay>ni</malay> to her name
which now you don't expect her to dance [lah] she's got no interest already
#nadia# my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that (oo) tag rugby
(oo) touch rugby tag rugby
ya <malay>dia suka panjat-panjat</malay> [pe] <malay>banyak</malay> [pe] they go hiking and everything but then <malay>sekarang</malay>
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego [ah] the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active [lah] she is like she is active since young so
she's the one <malay>yang</malay> climbing all over the place
she's daring [lah] she she has the confidence
can [lah] let her try [lah]
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store [lah] #tasha# #tasha# hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs [lah]
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set [what] knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay [lah]
it belongs to #tasha# or belongs to her
then it should be able to [lah] and #tasha# use
should be [lah] it's kids size [what]
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
[eh] she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
<malay>tak boleh</malay> loose out <malay>ke dia</malay>
<malay>dia takleh kalah</malay> you understand or not
<malay>dia</malay>
that's why <malay>dia main</malay> game <malay>dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah</malay> I <malay>rasa dah</malay> better [lah] <malay>sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam</malay> #iman# <malay>main nak menang</malay>
<malay>kalah nangis</malay>

<malay>semalam</malay> I think <malay>dah kurang</malay> [ah]
<malay>nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum</malay> they they <malay>dia orang minum air putih</malay>

very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you [lah] see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast [lah]
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway [lah] but she haven't message me
I think she's coming from #sengkang# I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later <malay>si</malay> #mas# <malay>ni</malay>
#peck seah# P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start (err) preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time [lah] the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind [ah] if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
they've prepared so much so half a year later <malay>baru dah</malay> towards the end <malay>nak nak nak</malay> <malay>dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat</malay>
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
<malay>kalau tak nanti kelam kabut</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
but they have they have tuition [what]
#amirah's# (err) siblings they have tuition
[ah]
I thought #amirah# go for (err) (oo) visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
(uh) but math class
my only worry is #nadia's# math I mean ya now she's average [ah] but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
because the thing is for me <malay>dia punya</malay> the the the problem sum [lah]
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is #tasha# cannot help much also with maths
at least science
(err) english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind [lah]
at least if we start her early because we started #tasha# like only in P five
right started #tasha# with five
(hmm)
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as #tasha#

you went there for your business
!huh! that means from singapore you have to fly to #jakarta# first then from #jakarta# quarantine for one night <malay>lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> #batam# why never go #batam# directly from singapore take ferry
I see
[ah] okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve (err) november
[orh] then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks [lah] [ah]
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain [lah] facebook [lah] they say not nice [lah] some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from #batam# or is there any requirement that you need to get

[ah] so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like <malay>macam</malay> nazi [lah] but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information <malay>lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini</malay> probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason [ah]
ya [lah] too much [lah] this one [ah] anyway [ah] so your two weeks how okay everything
[ah] okay [lah] because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have #sentosa# hotel I don't know [lah] these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning [ah] <malay>betul tak</malay> then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
[ah]
[ah]

talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks [dah] end of the year already !wah! very fast man correct or not [ah]
!alamak!
[ah]
new year <malay>tahun ini</malay> <malay>jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd [lah] so
<malay>kemungkinan</malay>
<malay>apa-apa yang</malay> countdown <malay>semua dekat</malay> neighbourhood estate [jer] [lah]
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning [lah] <malay>macam</malay> north east south west <malay>ke apa</malay> so <malay>kat mana-mana yang</malay> okay <malay>kau tinggal</malay> north <malay>ada bunga api tinggal</malay> south <malay>ada bunga api</malay> west <malay>ada bunga api</malay> so instead of going to the central <malay>punya bunga api</malay> so everybody goes your own division their own area their own <malay>kampung</malay> to enjoy [lah] but anyway I mean
this is a new beginning [ah] they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know [lah] [ah] I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
singapore <malay>bila</malay>
sixteen march <malay>ke</malay>
sixteen march [eh]
sixteen march <malay>dia orang tutup</malay> sixteen march <malay>sekali kira</malay> march april may june july august september november [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sembilan bulan</malay> [ah]
but but very fast [ah] nine months
<malay>pejam celik pejam celik dah</malay> nine months <malay>dah nak masuk satu tahun</malay>
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one [ah] that's what they said is probably two two [lah] so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
(mm)
okay [lah] spend money in singapore [lah] staycation now government give [ah] hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel [lah] I think you have to book to those but five platform only
<malay>tak</malay>
you no need to take <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [what] what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
the places that you want to go (err) places of interest or staycation
you have to book through these five different platform okay (err) <malay>yang satu</malay> #changi# and then (err) I think trip (err) there's another three more [lah] <malay>aku tak ingat mana satu</malay> (err) then
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass [ah] and then from there then you can use [lah] you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself [ah] you can use that or you can use partly the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you cannot do <malay>yang kau tak boleh buat</malay> is <malay>kau buat</malay> stack up <malay>maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>dua ratus kita</malay> stay in hotel for free [ah] <malay>itu tak boleh tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can (uh) offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up [ah] that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it [lah] so in the domination of ten meaning let say <malay>kalau kau</malay> example <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> zoo <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars [lah] or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that [ah] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> combine [lah] that's how it goes but
okay [lah] they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore [lah] but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one [lah] so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period [ah]
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to <malay>kelam-kabut kata orang</malay> [kan] [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] next year <malay>pun boleh</malay> january <malay>pun boleh</malay> february <malay>pun boleh</malay> as long as <malay>pakai sebelum</malay> july [lah] so ya
<malay>kau belum pernah pergi</malay> sea aquarium [ah] [eh] talking about sea aquarium <malay>aku pun pernah pergi</malay> [ah] adventure cove
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
[eh]
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo #jurong# bird park #sentosa# I don't want [lah] so all these places went already [ah] so I need to go something different [ah] maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night [ah] maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels [lah] you want to go those like hotel [ah] of course you need to come out still same price [lah] not much difference [ah] anyway
ya
[ah]
serious [ah]
government give us [ah]
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>mampus</malay>
[ah] okay okay I understand
[ah] so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing [lah]
!huh!
<malay>macam mana boleh tak</malay> orginal <malay>ada potong potong ke mampus</malay> <malay>kat mana ni kat</malay> #batam# <malay>ni</malay> indonesia [lah]
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah [lah] example [ah] one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
<malay>dia ambil</malay> they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end <malay>sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kurang</malay> [ah] !wah! <malay>ini macam pun boleh</malay> [eh] <malay>mati</malay>
<malay>kesempatan dalam kesempitan</malay>
<malay>mampus</malay> take advantage of the whole situation [lah] to get something [ah]
be quite too expensive or what
no
!huh!
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
!huh! I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then (uh) hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up [what] then what's the point of
<malay>takut</malay>
<malay>takut daripada</malay> negative <malay>jadi</malay> positive
!huh!
bullshit
!huh!
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive [what] right so why is the other way round
what the
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>betul-betul punya tak faham</malay>
really happen
until now [ah]
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
[oh] that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better [what]
funny [ah]
why [ah] like that
anyway
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
ya
[oh] ya ya #saiful# one so touching [ah] I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that <malay>pergi kat semberang tambak</malay> #johor# and and one of them <malay>dekat</malay> woodland one of them <malay>dekat</malay> #johor# <malay>dekat apa tu tempat tu</malay> [eh] [eh]

I do not know [ah] shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is #johor# one is #woodlands# so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet [ah] whoever pick up that story [ah] go viral [ah]
no [lah] he I think yes he no [eh]
this year ya correct correct because right right right
correct because why we wanted to go for his wedding that was [ah] ya ya we wanted to go for his wedding in so everybody was applying for leave #marhan# was also asking for leave then #iskandar# was asking me [eh] bro <malay>boleh pinjam kereta nak pergi masuk</malay> #johor# <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] <malay>kereta masuk</malay> #johor# because of
(err) #saiful# wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID <malay>semua tarik-tarik</malay> then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore [ah] those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end <malay>tak jadi pergi</malay> but #alhamdulillah# they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia [what] so <malay>kat</malay> malaysia <malay>semua</malay> cancel [kan] everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that [ah] I think during that period still
people are still <malay>was-was</malay> fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual (err) wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel [kan] for him
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go <malay>sanding dekat</malay> #johor# [kan] ya ya ya true true true true
ask his wife to come singapore [ah] bring in
he is going back to #johor#
so he's
no but singapore <malay>pun ada</malay>
singapore <malay>boleh</malay>
then after that he's
ya but the <malay>nikah dekat</malay> singapore <malay>kan</malay> #johor# okay
[oh] he is going back #johor# now
then
no pay leave two months [lah] singapore no pay leave two months [ah]
[ah] then after that bring in the wife come singapore
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because if not have to pay still have to pay [what] that means he if he bring his wife
[oh] ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia #johor# you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation [lah]
<malay>empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam</malay> divide by three one thousand plus [lah] so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean (err) [lah] consider
but singapore
the the the cases zero [what] community wise why go there still still need to
stay for two weeks instead of seven days <malay>kelakar betul</malay> [lah] malaysia <malay>ini</malay>
subsidise [lah]
I mean if if if now (err) the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go #johor# knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now

[oh] ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing [ah] because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation [eh] whereby if let's say you go to
any restaurants or you go to online or you want you know singaporeans being singaporeans we want to taste a lot of foods I mean that is nice there is is a nature is a niche correct so <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
food [eh] asian food [eh] <malay>kau kata</malay> [kan] japanese chinese korean
thai vietnamese
that is all halal [tau] in southeast don't talk about malaysian food indonesian food [lah] <malay>banyak kat</malay> singapore if you talk about talk about japanese halal food there is a lot okay coming up
you are talking about chinese halal food <malay>banyak ada</malay> [kan] you're talking about thai halal there is thai vietnamese are halal <malay>ada</malay> so
indian okay [lah] they have <malay>tak payah cakap</malay> [ah] western so many fusion food you go to arab street you see from one end to one end a lot of fish and chips whatever was so I was thinking I was asking my girlfriend hopefully [lah] #inshaallah# [eh] <malay>kalau mungkin jadi isteri</malay> [kan] I was asking her [eh]
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
[ah] is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and (err) gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place [lah] be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put (err) (err) (err)
different taste local of a filipino taste [lah] so yes we did that already so #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
and then (err) lemon herbs and then the other one is portuguese spicy so all filipino <malay>punya</malay> taste [lah] so okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in so we are doing that and then (err) come out into pasta and we are coming up into some filipinos taste [lah] so hopefully
home made [ah]
hopefully [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
correct
[ah]
[ah]
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully [lah] [ah] be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet [lah] because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first (uh) (uh)
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it (err)
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert [lah] then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
and thai tea made made made of thai tea [lah] crepes and everything and just this simple (err) food of (uh) tea I think tea tea thailand and (uh) crepes and and (err) of course she use to be an air stewardess but now she because she of this COVID everything right so she open a home based business [lah] #alhamdulillah# it was it was people like accepting it and that they order and I was like [eh] not bad [ah] and she's basically just a local doing thai milk tea and thai crepes only (uh) <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia punya kirakan dia punya</malay> ingredient [ah]
okay [lah] good [lah] I was thinking
correct
true
ya [lah]
so ya [lah] so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully [lah] hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit [lah]

[ah] <malay>tapi patut</malay> goes with other uni <malay>tapi dorang tak</malay> report
but is it reported to the authorities or not

alright alright
<malay>tak apa</malay> I think for now <malay>kita kena</malay> (err) try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so <malay>apa yang</malay> #sulaiman# Twitter <malay>macam mana nak</malay> start
okay so basically <malay>sejak dulu</malay> I've always wanted to go to the kampung <malay>nak</malay> stay the night <malay>tapi</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>dah ajak</malay> so <malay>tak dapat tidur</malay> overnight <malay>cuma setakat gi mancing</malay> overnight then <malay>aku ni</malay> expert <malay>pergi sana</malay> without any proper clothing
and (uh) the the <malay>dah jadi mangsa</malay> to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my <malay>aurat</malay>
(err) I went to the one that is nearer to to #sulaiman's# house <malay>juga</malay> [lah] it's it's just a
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
<malay>kalau</malay> jetty <malay>tu jauh</malay> jetty <malay>tu</malay> is really quite a distance this [one] is <malay>yang kat belakang kampung</malay> you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then <malay>kat sana kita gi</malay> cast our rods [lah]
no that time was all the way to #jelutong# that [one] is all the way at the other end of the island <malay>yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu orang melayu</malay> [kan]
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
okay you need a best part (err) <malay>banyak petuk tapi</malay> is just <malay>yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang ikan tudung periuk</malay>
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya <malay>tapi ikan tu</malay> the story <malay>lagi</malay> best
<malay>aku dah mancing aku sengaja</malay> feel <malay>nak</malay> reel in <malay>tapi bila dah dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil</malay> #sulaiman# to come and check then all of a sudden <malay>kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail</malay> [kan] <malay>betul-betul sangkut kat hidung</malay>
<malay>betul-betul</malay> on the nose
then the rest of the night <malay>tak ada ikan</malay>
<malay>betul-betul potong</malay>
<malay>kita jumpa dekat</malay> singapore so the the <malay>asal</malay> before <malay>kita jumpa sekeluarga</malay>
then <malay>dia datang naik</malay> grab <malay>bila dia</malay> claw grab <malay>ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa</malay>
<malay>betul-betul keluar barang</malay> one by one <malay>ada</malay> claw back trolley <malay>besar satu bakul satu</malay> (err) <malay>bawa langsir</malay>
<malay>nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia</malay> then actually the next day more fun <malay>keluarga dia datang</malay> the next day <malay>dia nya</malay> extended relatives [lah] <malay>dia datang bawa tiga</malay>
no [lah] I think for them maybe is about
connections [lah] <malay>kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya</malay> family <malay>yang dia punya</malay> extended family <malay>ni memang satu orang tu</malay> driver so <malay>kalau</malay> coincidentally <malay>dia dapat</malay> arrange with the driver <malay>senang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah bayar tambang</malay> free of charge
okay so <malay>kita dah sampai kampung</malay> #sulaiman# get everything ready six o'clock then <malay>salin baju semua</malay>
(err) that's what made me worried [lah] <malay>tengok dia dah pakai</malay> all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then <malay>terus</malay>
initially no intention <malay>tapi bila dah nampak</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>keluarkan joran tu</malay> the intention came out [lah]
okay so six get already then after that we (err)
six twenty five <malay>kita gerak</malay> then from there <malay>kita jalan</malay> all the way to that spot
(err) until six thirty five then
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually <malay>macam</malay> where you get all the <malay>air keluar masuk</malay> then <malay>bila air pasang semua macam</malay> marina barrage [lah] and then you get on top of the stone then #sulaiman# <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>ni</malay> part <malay>gerek</malay> [tau] <malay>bila</malay> high tide <malay>kita tak boleh keluar</malay> [tau]
<malay>kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap</malay> go [jer] [ah] don't scared then <malay>betul-betul bila</malay> high tide [eh] <malay>terus</malay> #sulaiman# pointed at me #wan# <malay>tengok terus kita dah</malay> surrounded <malay>kiri kanan air pasang besar</malay>
then at first <malay>macam mula-mula tak boleh</malay> understand [lah] like the the depth of the <malay>air tapi bila air surut</malay>
once you see that low tide <malay>dia punya</malay> drop from the top of the dam to the bottom <malay>seram</malay> [sia] <malay>dua dua tingkat</malay> yes
so <malay>macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul</malay> because of that that (err) concrete structure <malay>bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam</malay> [seh]
yes
ya so basically <malay>macam</malay> this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path <malay>yang kita kena jalan atas</malay>
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> from there is like a hill downwards [lah] so from there <malay>ada</malay> slope to (err) to <malay>bakau-bakau sini</malay> and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so <malay>bila air pasang</malay>
the whole valley below <malay>semua ni semua</malay> covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest [eh]
<malay>betul-betul macam sini</malay> [tau] then <malay>dia cakap man kalau</malay> get any higher how <malay>aku cakap macam tu</malay> [lah] #wan#
<malay>takde</malay> there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm <malay>kau try juga</malay> high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours (err) because
<malay>air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh</malay> but the coast too low then after that we were there until
<malay>pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam</malay> ya then after that <malay>pukul satu</malay>
<malay>tu apa</malay> was the highest then after that <malay>betul-betul tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> literally [sia]
<malay>macam</malay> tsunami <malay>betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam</malay>
<malay>tak juga</malay> okay <malay>itu</malay> best okay this part censored <malay>sikit</malay> <malay>bila nak kencing kita ada satu</malay> spot
<malay>satu</malay> spot on the whole man-made structure <malay>kita</malay> technically I will consider this <malay>macam</malay> the north eastern part of it
away from the <malay>laut tapi</malay> towards the kampung
<malay>habis tu ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> #rilek# <malay>terus dengar ada kat belakang</malay> what what's that noise <malay>jangan pandang belakang</malay> [oh]
censored ya so #sulaiman# was there to pee [lah] then after that (err) not long after that [lah] my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so #sulaiman# will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for #sulaiman# he only peed once I peed
two three times because there's nothing much to do but #sulaiman# what he did most was he he <malay>makan</malay> some Pringles [lah]
enjoy the enjoy
okay so #sulaiman# <malay>dia dia tunjuk</malay> something this [one] is about #naz# <malay>yang</malay> recommend
<malay>dia ada satu</malay> backpack <malay>ni dia jadi tempat duduk</malay>
<malay>kirakan macam</malay> backpack <malay>punya</malay> the the sponge <malay>tu dia punya</malay> padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that #sulaiman# just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>atas</malay>
but for my end <malay>ini tempat</malay> legend <malay>aku tak ada benda</malay> then (um) #sulaiman# <malay>punya</malay> mum <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak</malay>
then I I I find this <malay>yang</malay> the simple basic students <malay>yang lipat yang buka tutup</malay> boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then <malay>kita</malay> testing <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kampung tapi bila kita</malay> testing [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena</malay> fragile <malay>sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi</malay> the whole boat collapsed

so there's always <malay>quran</malay> throughout the whole island <malay>boleh dengar</malay> because <malay>kampung</malay> it's from malaysia [lah] you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably <malay>memang</malay> isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the <malay>surau</malay> if I'm not mistaken is the <malay>masjid kampung</malay> #pasir puteh#
so white sands literally <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia ya then that <malay>masjid</malay> is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area #pulau ketam# should hear it louder than <malay>kampung melayu</malay>
three three testing [ah] sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
and ya [lah] so <malay>yang</malay> okay so <malay>yang</malay> #pulau ketam# is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see [ah] (uh huh) [ah]
[oh] the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of #pulau ketam# from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in [lah] maybe a place I've never been in before [lah]
(oo) that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to #punggol# to already
[orh] !aduh! so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
<malay>ikan besar</malay>
[oh] here comes the big one and (uh) instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your #pulau ubin# story thank you so almost for sharing
(err) time check this [one] I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually (err) after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot [lah] I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit [lah] ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
[lah] [kan] [lah] [kan] [eh] yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months [ah] [ah]
okay so for now the same thing [lah] just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for (err) I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being (err) more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on [lah]
I think slowly [lah] [eh] because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed [lah] I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more [lah] ya so just (err) pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
(err) with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then #inshallah# when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck [lah] then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that (err) it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I #alhamdullilah# I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it [lah] if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application [lah]
(err) !wah! cannot I cannot think that means a lot already [lah]
(err)
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've (err) sent for has been
(err) civil service (err) healthcare (err) cleaning (err)
around those [lah] is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call [lah]
ya <malay>kenapa</malay> [seh] <malay>mana ada</malay>
<malay>tadi</malay> in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
<malay>campurkan melayu sikit</malay> with the english but when I try to put in the <malay>melayu</malay> I understand that I hesitate a bit <malay>jadi terkaku</malay> [lah]
<malay>habis bila dah</malay> focused then (err) then all the sentence everywhere
<malay>jadi kita</malay> try our best to not really mix everything [lah] cause that's that's against what they want us to do [pe]
ya [lah] so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
[ah] yes <malay>ada kisahnya</malay> all
the rejection is the best part [ah] silence which is the most annoying part because technically [eh] by right the most professional way for is
<malay>kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang</malay> [jer] [lah] but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this [one] I can say [lah] because I think one month <malay>dah</malay> over <malay>pun</malay>
(err) I applied for this (err) safe distancing (err) ambassador at <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah#
at caldecott area there (err) more of central macritchie [lah] macritchie reservoir [ah] so it's there
so that [one] is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most <malay>yang kasi harapan</malay> because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum <malay>terpinga-pinga</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ni nak bayar ni</malay>
ya ya then for me I was (err) I just answer the call then <malay>cakap</malay> hi (err) #assalamualaikum# (err) (err) is this #shazwan# on the line
then I <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] yes may I know who is this <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] I am from <malay>masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>mula-mula aku fikir aku</malay> apply <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah# <malay>asal</malay> why is it <malay>yang masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>yang</malay> call
then I realise [ah] because (err) this thing is by right <malay>ada</malay> #muhajirin# but they need someone to (err) cover #omar salmah# so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then <malay>aku</malay> explain to them [lah] <malay>yang</malay> okay <malay>aku ni dua puluh empat tahun</malay>
then (err) then
she ask the question <malay>tahu ke tak yang</malay> this place is very far very <malay>ulu ada</malay> transports <malay>sendiri ke tak</malay> then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes [lah]
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that (err) we'll just keep in touch (err) within the week we'll call you back
within the week so <malay>sekarang dah satu bulan</malay>
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing [eh] like like at least <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the <malay>rezeki</malay> I've been waiting for ya <malay>ke tak</malay> it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
(err) with every passing day (err) when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish [lah] like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings [ah] playing my heart
(err) it's not it's <malay>tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak baik</malay>
I think I think I think that [one] is the worst [lah] okay so to talk about <malay>sakit hati</malay> this [one] I don't know if if <malay>kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib</malay> because it it it involves <malay>masjid juga</malay>
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the <malay>masjid</malay>
but I will say the proximity of the <malay>masjid</malay> the <malay>masjid</malay> is in the east so this <malay>masjid</malay> he surrounding <malay>dia</malay> has quite a few other #masjids#
[ah]
yes so this is a part of singapore <malay>yang ada banyak masjid</malay> quite near each other [ah] if you knows what I'm talking about
so
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the <malay>masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit</malay> okay it's one it's definitely <malay>tak tak</malay> famous [lah] which is why <malay>lagi aku</malay> fed up
so okay so basically (err)
the whole story is <malay>yang mula-mula</malay> I got this call from this (err) person from I would say the communications department [lah]
[kan] so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying (um) #assalamualaikum# #shazwan# (err) <malay>saya</malay> #nik# <malay>ni</malay> (err)
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind <malay>siapa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni terus cakap</malay> since when am I helping to design a poster
then
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like (err) we are urgent [lah] urgent can you help us in my mind <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>aku tak cakap benda</malay> I didn't I didn't want to be on board <malay>tapi</malay> the way you say <malay>macam kesian juga ini masjid</malay>
ya so so that's the story [lah] the middle person (err)
(err) eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just <malay>mentang-mentang kasi</malay> my
my number to this (err) communications officer [lah] then (err) after that
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me [lah] my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then <malay>bila aku dah buat semua</malay> they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the #asatizahs# mentioned then <malay>aku fikir aku memang</malay> [lah] <malay>bukan orang alim</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> who are these <malay>ustaz</malay> I don't know these <malay>ustaz</malay> what if I type the same <malay>ustaz</malay> and I put <malay>ustaz nama nama ustaz</malay> different person I wouldn't know also [what]
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend [lah] <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun</malay> by right <malay>macam orang masjid</malay> [lah]
and he he managed to provide me <malay>yang gambar-gambar betul</malay> [lah] so #alhamdullilah# so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature [lah] basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the <malay>asatizah</malay> and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
is #fandi ahmad# #fandi ahmad#
yes so so that's why I say this <malay>masjidnya sebab apa</malay>
<malay>ada pula panggil</malay> #fandi ahmad# so I already did the design (err) I understand that the communications officer <malay>sebenarnya dia orang muda</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> actually understand my style <malay>dia pun suka</malay> my style but of course <malay>kita akhirnya</malay> when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then (err)
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say (um) <malay>aku rasa ada</malay> problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
so by right even for me [lah] when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event <malay>kita selalu</malay> moderator <malay>dulu</malay> you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint <malay>juga</malay> I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the #asatizahs# together
and then I got #fandi ahmad# but the person who viewed this thing said (err) do you think it might be offensive to the <malay>asatizah</malay> that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind <malay>aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke</malay> is that is that healthy for you to say [eh] <malay>aku lebih alim</malay> [pe] is that actually healthy <malay>sangat</malay>
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment [lah] so okay (err) I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then <malay>asatizah</malay> and then #fandi ahmad# would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say [eh] if I <malay>macam tu</malay> I I put circle <malay>pun</malay> you will find somewhere to start <malay>semua mesti salah punya</malay> right
then (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
you know because for my for me (err) the the thing is me and this (err) officer
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen <malay>ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda</malay> so the explanation is okay but I still feel [ah] that's it that's it so once that happens
(err) game [lah] so I I really at that time <malay>memang macam</malay> upset [lah] but the [oh] the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman <malay>cakap</malay> okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight <malay>dia pun bilang aku</malay> that timing and then after that the next day <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> the officer called me
[eh] not call [lah] Whatsapp me say [eh] sorry #shazwan# we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
that the pictures of <malay>asatizah</malay> are made into cartoons and then ya !alah! I <malay>fikir</malay>
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger <malay>ke telinga besar ke</malay> is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the <malay>asatizah</malay> drawn as a cartoon then <malay>aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat</malay>
ya so that's why in this <malay>situasi</malay> you can actually see
that <malay>orang tua</malay> is not very flexible they understand everything then
(err) so the officer said
I really apologise for this thing (um) <malay>boleh tak</malay>
(err) <malay>kita</malay> delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the <malay>asatizah</malay> in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces <malay>buat cantik-cantik</malay> bring it bigger make the font smaller
<malay>semua tu</malay> means nothing [lah] he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
<malay>cakap</malay> we know of someone who can help us for free [ah] without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why <malay>bila aku dah</malay> [tau] <malay>dah</malay> find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was <malay>panas</malay> I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said (err) <malay>salam semua</malay> this is the poster that I have done
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say [lah] (err) it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
<malay>nanti tiba-tiba</malay> [jer] <malay>nama dah masuk dalam</malay> for <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat</malay>
[ah] <malay>memang</malay> so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
<malay>yang mereka masih</malay> persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to (err) <malay>macam tukar</malay> (err) <malay>pemikiran orang-orang atas</malay> [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature <malay>tapi kita pun nak kena tengok</malay> logic [tau] the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you (err)
secondary school [lah] <malay>kau tengok gambar macam</malay> comic and <malay>gambar macam</malay> real <malay>mana satu yang kau macam</malay> more !wah! this [one] seems more interesting
ya [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
ya [lah] so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
so <malay>itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia</malay> communication in the beginning <malay>pun tak kasi</malay> [tau] they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then <malay>betul-betul cakap</malay> I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then <malay>terpaksa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita</malay> forgive
<malay>tapi</malay> when they start saying [oh] by the way #shazwan# (err) can you just put the original picture [ah] that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair <malay>juga</malay> [lah] if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing <malay>memang</malay> unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced <malay>ikhlas ke tak ikhlas</malay> so
that's the that's the sad part [lah] which is why it reminded me of the of the time <malay>yang dulu</malay>
<malay>kita ni kalau buat</malay> design <malay>ni</malay> freelance never do for free
that's why (mm) yes (mm)
the video [lah] [kan] the video
(uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
[ah] !aduh!
(mm) <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes <malay>macam</malay> for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment <malay>cakap kalau senang senang kau buat</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri</malay> what you mean so easy do yourself
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense [lah] because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
(err) no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
then okay <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati</malay>
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings (err) time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
(err) even for you (err) folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our (err) podcast <malay>terima kasih</malay>
<malay>kerana sudi mendengar kita</malay> (err) <malay>dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya</malay> everything has been a true story believe it or not

<malay>sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk</malay> (err) <malay>tolong</malay> [ah] which is interesting because in english we say friday night <malay>tapi kalau</malay> like in in malay
today is not we today we cannot say
(err) <malay>malam jumaat malam jumaat</malay> is thursday so the logic [eh] if you you if you're curious is that <malay>sebab kita</malay>
(err) we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
so <malay>maghrib</malay> is when we start our day so that's why for <malay>hari raya</malay> [ah] if you are also curious why we don't (err) fast
on the last day [eh] sorry why we don't pray on <malay>yang malam terakhir itu</malay> is because only <malay>hari raya</malay>
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning [oh] damn
so yes (err) these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but !hey! you are a
listener
ya now <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita asyik berbual</malay> for forty eight minutes straight [kan] these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
(err) people the only participants <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>bual benda-benda merepek</malay> especially towards the the later part of this (err)
podcast (err) I wanted to say project which is the thing [lah] but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already [lah] <malay>kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa</malay> [lah] [kan]

(mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya [lah] we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step [lah] like we said as malay
when it comes to the next steps we need to know what's the next step if it's a little bit too much <malay>takpe</malay> thank you
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the #mat-mat# accent
but the #mat-mat# accent but I think
should be okay [lah] because you wanted singlish singlish is basically (err) <malay>orang bangsa macam-macam bual bahasa macam-macam</malay> together #rojak# and then that's that's our language our pride and honour
pride <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> record <malay>lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>dah tutup</malay>

[oh] that [one] that [one] we haven't plan yet
but knowing #angah# I think he wants to eat
malay food like <malay>nasi</malay>
!aww! this [one] is nice
but I think because of the adults <malay>itu</malay> [lah] I think ya
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel [eh]
because the Amara hotel what what my (uh) what I
thought that I
(err) should do right
is I will take two separate room
and then one room is me <malay>kak</malay> #ain# #aryan# and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents [lah] so they can <malay>apa ni</malay>
at least they can spend the night together
since it's his <malay>hari jadi</malay> also my father
there
<malay>lagi lagi dia</malay> half price [seh] of the Pan Pacific <malay>tapi</malay> like okay [lah] like like we cannot be together in one room [lah]
[oh] they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay [lah]
let's see the photos
but I know they <malay>baru</malay> recently just renovated [tau]
Amara
!huh! got no plate
Maggi
you know like some hotel <malay>macam</malay> they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
because like how [mah] want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay [lah] #ilham# can sleep outside
ya
this [one] [oh] okay [dah] I think this is the [one] that I wanted to take
[eh] no <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay <malay>ni</malay>
#angah# don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
<malay>dia tak suka</malay>
like <malay>dia kata</malay> like very boring [seh]
okay this one is for three adults right
so I was thinking that okay [lah] either way [lah] like if (uh) <malay>adik</malay> want to if my younger want to sleep with
(uh) <malay>ayah</malay> and #ma# then go ahead
they can sleep
on the floor [lah] of course [lah] with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that [lah] as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I think I will I really think I will <malay>bangun pagi</malay> if
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
the artscience museum <malay>yang dekat</malay> <malay>tak</malay>
is it
(mm)
(mm)

or the another one is this one also Ascott [oh] the price [oh] my god

I think he will also like I think he will also like (um) <malay>apa tu lagi satu tu</malay>
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward [lah] but I think he
I think he don't mind
need to <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
no [eh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why [ah] why you don't like it
[oh] is it
what did you have
a a what
[oh]
(mm) okay [lah] I will decide
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
<malay>mana</malay> notes [ah]
I also have it every month
(err) <malay>abeh</malay> (um) okay [lah] I will decide
on the itinerary
ya <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> (um)
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that (um) indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
you know what you mean I I I I thought like <malay>macam</malay> the culture is
is like a bit weird [lah] so when I taste it [eh] I thought that it's going to be bad but then like [oh] my god it's so nice
(err) I ate the prawn green curry you the #naan#
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we (uh) we
(mm) it's too loud (mm)
because we we passed by and then after that we thought [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] can [ah] like craving something local because like that is how many days already we are there
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay [lah]
and then I don't really like #udon#
that's why maybe I don't (mm)
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
when I taste it I was like [eh] <malay>sedap</malay> [seh] then like
(err) okay [lah] I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like (uh)
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar [tau] for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
#naan#
okay [lah] it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay !wow! I I I don't ever have
<malay>macam</malay> like this kind of food
<malay>bila dekat</malay> singapore
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
(mm) (mm) (mm)
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
(mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in #bali# remember the the Yoshinoya
the #yakiniku# beef
is it the same thing
[ah]
but then that one the one that I ate also called #yakiniku# beef why
[oh] wait
maybe maybe maybe
[oh] is it
(mm)
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose #mee soto#
[oh] okay
<malay>susah</malay> [eh]
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
I think it'll be my mum's (err) <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay>
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know [what]
because if I take that <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay> then can I can it be served <malay>dengan nasi</malay> or no if no <malay>nasi</malay> then I don't want it
because it need to be with <malay>nasi</malay> [lah] hot piping <malay>nasi</malay>
I think my I think my mum my mum's (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi goreng daging</malay> is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay [lah] then the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I think is a good choice
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
<malay>telur mata lembu</malay> on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like (um)
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it [lah]
of course right
but like <malay>macam</malay> like when you become her
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
[oh] but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity [ah] rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like [oh] my god [oh] my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the #wayi# can just like (err) can I
ya can I just like (err) take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
(err) helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like I really seriously <malay>tak tahu</malay> why they need like <malay>banyak banyak bilik</malay>
like <malay>bilik dorang banyak</malay> [tau] like
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room (uh) house is like seven million
(err) with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets (err) attached (uh) with (uh) indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
or <malay>macam main</malay> hide and seek <malay>ke</malay>
scary [siol]
I don't think I can
don't [ah]
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
(ugh)
(mmhmm)
and then they put there as a meme
okay [oh] ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
<malay>dekat dalam</malay> flat like (err)
buy one get one free
[oh] you mean like okay okay I don't know
(hmm)
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
[ah] okay then that kind of deal like okay [lah] [meh] I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay [lah] maybe that one is a bit worse
like !huh! one for one
but I don't get to choose
ya but <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> let's say they
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
ya okay that one is already (um) <malay>macam</malay>
standard [lah]
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body [ah]
[ha]
I think the face you look at it every day like <malay>hari hari tengok</malay>
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like (ugh)
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
or like <malay>tukar</malay> the face in like
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
[dah] <malay>sapau sapau muka macam</malay>
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like (uh)
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things [lah] maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
(err)
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients [eh] no no no (uh) like he or she is not wrong
[ah] no <malay>dia macam dia tak dia tak</malay> murder that person <malay>dia tak</malay> kill that person is it
and everything like that and then
[ah] I like like ya I like (uh) true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news [oh] I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are (um)
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
(uh) or like paranormal activity all these like
(um) (uh) cable (uh) ya
a good movie correct
ya they want to like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] this is we captured it for the camera
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
(err) ya ya ya
ya
(mm)
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what [ah]
[ah] chris watts [ah] is it the chris watts
the [one] that she the [one] that the the
ya the [one] that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
(um)
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can (uh) on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay [lah] maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix [one] [eh]
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
(uh) I mean he's a narcissist what (uh) eventually he will just gonna act that [oh] no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
like the fact that like he had (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err) he got a mistress
(err) (uh) okay it's a girlfriend <malay>yang</malay> he knows
about two months prior prior to the wedding [eh] prior to the murder sorry
ya like <malay>macam</malay>
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
<malay>dorang</malay> actually did include
(err) the girlfriend [lah] but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious [lah]
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like (um)
not <malay>kecil</malay> [lah] maybe when I was a teenager
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle [lah] like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like (uh) grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the [one] that
I had after I had
#aryan# after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
(uh) healthy okay [lah] healthy is subjective [lah]
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
love him [ah] like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>atuk nenek dia punya dia punya</malay>
especially to his <malay>atuk nenek</malay> [lah] because like
this
two people is the [one] <malay>yang apa ni</malay> bring you up
take care of you when you are young [kan] so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
return the favour [lah] I think he really need to <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [dah] <malay>besar</malay> he will need to realise [oh] [eh] actually I <malay>nak</malay>
I need to (err) <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> I need (uh) anything that
(err) they need I have to
do it
for them
[ah] and then my third wish actually
(uh) I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still (uh) I'm already pretty
[oh] I
(err) when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
and I know about it happen because <malay>kita kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
(err) (uh) (um) lower secondary
then I think
ya ya ya that that was what (uh) <malay>apa yang</malay> I mean [lah] like
I really think <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is like
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
I know right and then and then a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> nothing you know they like have a job and then the next time they don't have
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
<malay>macam</malay> like things happened just like that and there are a lot of people the most
thing the most like <malay>macam paling sedih</malay> that I've heard
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head [kan] I will actually really think like then I was like [eh] like quite sad [lah] like
they are somebody's
(err)
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad [lah]

november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
(err) actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation [lor]
no because you <malay>nak kena kerja dengan</malay> kids [kan]
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya [lah] I pass
so
you know that day I went for (uh) a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
at white lodge which is actually just here only <malay>kat</malay> west coast road
and white lodge is (um)
it's a private (uh) institution
ya it's a private (err) it's a private school [lah] it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's (uh) it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge (um)
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in [ah] okay like the the one I went I went (uh) from eight thirty to one
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I have to (um)
I have to (err) assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates [lah] but they are they are like
one teacher (err) to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
depending on the group so <malay>kat</malay> over there the the the smaller the the smallest is three years old
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then (um)
after that the okay so what I did was like (uh)
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
(um) I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children [lah] (um) okay the first half the eight thirty to
eleven twenty <malay>tu yang</malay> before the lunchtime <malay>[kan]</malay> I actually assisted the teachers
(um)
for kids that (uh) the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
that's what I'm amazed and <malay>dorang punya</malay> culture is very diverse because most is all
#ang moh#
and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh#
like (um) japanese and japanese korean and (uh) sweden
like swedish sweden <malay>pula</malay> (um)
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] like
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local [one]
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international (uh) so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
[orh] ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
[ah] <malay>sakit kenapa sakit</malay> (hmm)
eight thirty to five [lah]
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because (uh) if you go under government
saturday you're (uh) open half day
then you need to alternate working [ah]
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this [one] like saturday sunday you are closed and then [what] I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
(uh) plus <malay>yang</malay> kid <malay>umur</malay>
three to six <malay>dengan</malay>
(err) five to [eh] sorry three to four <malay>dengan</malay> five five to six <malay>tu</malay>
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower [lah]
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see (uh) what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
because they are very like <malay>macam</malay>
colourful
colourful characters [lah] like
(err) and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the (uh)
they call me they call me miss
#hu#
because they don't my my name is very long right then like (uh) okay never mind (uh) just okay just call me miss #hu#
okay then after that they
[oh] got one kid say (uh) miss #hu# can I go to the toilet please
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> when when she's done
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
(um) can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like !whoa! [eh]
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
(err) <malay>setengah</malay> of the kids like
<malay>setengah</malay> of the forty five kids <malay>yang</malay>
go to school on that day right
<malay>setengah</malay> will go home at one
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so [ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>balik tidur</malay> (uh) no they will they can the parents can only pick them (uh) the parents of the maid [ah]
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this (uh) one (um) one
(uh) no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
(uh) one kid is (err)
half german half japanese actually there's a lot of japanese mix <malay>kat</malay> over there
ya
half german half japanese so
and then (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like literally like
(um)
tell us like okay (uh)
<malay>kat rumah</malay> like this is how I talk to my parents
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like (uh) and then the kids will like [orh] then they will (uh)
try to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
attempt to attempt to say the language also [lah]
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because (uh) the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys [lah] girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime (uh) they (uh) then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
(mm)
before that <malay>dorang makan</malay> so it's like an early lunch like that
<malay>makan</malay> and then
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already [dah]
feed breakfast [lah]
and then after that when they wake up they still <malay>kasi</malay> snacks
they have like a snack [lah] like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that (uh) doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one [kan]
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later [lah]
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
(err) when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring [lah]
<malay>penat penat gila</malay> I think
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no (uh) you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like [oh] my god (uh) and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
and then after that (um) I think he he <malay>apa ni</malay> (um)
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
(uh) it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
[ah] kids also starting school soon
(um)

<malay>jangan jangan letak apa itu</malay> <malay>kena ada letak</malay> partition <malay>juga seperti gelas</malay> [lah]
<malay>jadi bila kalau</malay> you <malay>nak masak</malay>

ya <malay>betul</malay>
(err) <malay>orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan</malay>
(mm) <malay>dan</malay> <malay>dan apa itu</malay>

I <malay>picit loceng yang itu</malay>
no [lah] you not my waiter <malay>tapi</malay>
you are my (uh) private
cook
ya (uh) I will buy all the ingredient
and then (uh) I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter (um)
you want a you want to put like a (uh) you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
(uh) the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because [ah] ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better [lah] because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and (uh) moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food [lah]
ya
and then
ya
so you <malay>hari itu</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>kita kena tengok</malay>
(uh) <malay>harga</malay> quotation <malay>itu berapa</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack <malay>ke</malay> or
or total hack <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>itu kita kena tanya</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kita punya</malay> [lah] what will be the quotation

whether it's whether <malay>kalau</malay> within <malay>kita punya</malay> budget [ah]
ya (uh) ya platform <malay>itu pun dah</malay>
<malay>dah macam teruk sangat</malay>
so <malay>kena tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita nak</malay> hack and then <malay>nak pasang</malay> a new
<malay>baru punya</malay> platform
[ah] <malay>berapa</malay> <malay>akan</malay> quote <malay>kita</malay>

(mm) ya I I think you you think that concept
(err) I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack (uh) (uh) the what you call that the the wall there
(err)
and then you (uh) you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass

very nice <malay>cantik</malay>
you can consider <malay>tapi tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>harga dia berapa</malay>
(mm)
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
(uh) multiple attempt to
(uh) kill them
they (uh) they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
(uh) it (uh) spraying the the lizard repellents (uh) spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too [lah] the our our house here I think
(uh) the it's there's a lot of (uh) lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient [ah] even though I've tried to to to hit them [ah] is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
[oh] my god so (uh) I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
[ah]
is what <malay>kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil</malay>
<malay>sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan rumah kita macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia pandai</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak</malay> (err)
<malay>kotor apa dapur jadi kotor lantai jadi kotor</malay>
<malay>jadi memang setiap kali itu kena macam mana kena cuci kena sental dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> (err) <malay>apa itu</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> spray spray <malay>pencuci lantai semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan</malay>
<malay>tahi-tahi itu tapi kadang-kadang kita pun</malay>
(err) <malay>letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi</malay>
<malay>kita kadang-kadang kita tangguh</malay>
<malay>kita tangguh</malay>
time <malay>kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai</malay>
<malay>berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang</malay> is (err) <malay>isteri</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>isteri kalau</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu dia akan</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti apa isteri akan buat</malay> [kan]
(err)
ya
ya
<malay>memang</malay> (uh) ya [lah] I understand [lah] your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time [lah] it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners (uh) I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity [lah] it's a it's a need [lah] more of a need
necessity because everything has (err) you know
wears down you know
and (uh) our our kitchen looks quite dirty and (uh) rundown and (uh)
our our the (uh) you call it the flooring starts to (uh) wears down
[ah] ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and (uh) they feature a few (uh) [lah] but (uh) so far three D contractors (uh) in terms of
the the the outcome [ah] it it it suits our taste [ah]
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
[eh] very nice [lah] we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but (uh) ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that (uh)
the kitchen the kitchen <malay>apa itu</malay>
not not not the sink [ah] kitchen tap
quite a few [lah] and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus [oh] one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
who halfway (uh) <malay>merajuk</malay> and don't want to come
to finish off the [ah]
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
!aiya!
ya [lah] <malay>dia dia ini</malay>
I don't know [lah] it's both it is both (uh) frustrating and funny at the same time [eh]
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then (err)
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
you know like <malay>malas-malas</malay> to to come
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
(uh)
self guilt [lah] I think so I don't know [lah]
so emotional then <malay>merajuk</malay>
ya
cement
[oh]
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship [lah]
ya
ya the was
(uh) ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him [lah] probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain [oh] ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery [lah] but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
(mm) ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare [lah] how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how [lah]
which one we we want to choose
ya <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>bilang</malay> you [lah] (uh) (err) <malay>kita kasi dia orang</malay> arrange
<malay>kita kasi</malay> arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> will markup
or work <malay>kita punya</malay> budget so <malay>kita kasi</malay> them
arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so
(mm)
ya
actually ya [lah] <malay>macam lampu ini semua kita dah</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita dia punya</malay> cost <malay>itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
so I mean <malay>sekarang ini yang</malay> the more <malay>yang lebih</malay>

ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>kita pun kita punya</malay> budget <malay>pun tak banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita buat yang yang</malay> urgent <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
<malay>sejuk</malay> [ah]
so I think ya [lah]
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in (uh) (uh) in the future we have (uh)
<malay>kalau ada ada</malay> baby <malay>baru ke</malay> so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety <malay>dia tak keras sangat</malay>
<malay>kalau jatuh pun</malay> at least <malay>dia ada macam</malay> (uh) cushion this vinyl [kan] underneath <malay>dia ada</malay> cushion [kan]
then <malay>tak sejuk sangat</malay>
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
[ah]
ya
kitchen <malay>punya</malay> flooring
<malay>yang yang</malay> I I saw one of the picture you send
send me the one
with the kitchen <malay>punya</malay>
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring [ah]
I think that [one] is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that [one] the the more expensive one
(mm)
but have to
you have to ya [lah] everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
but (uh) ya the one that we saw <malay>kak</malay> #doro# using I think !wah!
if we have the the budget can consider [lah] I think that one's quite expensive is around
!wah! but I find it like very good [leh]
and it's wireless
(mm)
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
(uh) brands (uh)
(uh) have that those type of (uh) two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that [one] very good [ah] (uh) I think
can can consider [lah] if we have the means
but now we !aiya! we see how for now we just use manually first [ah]
use the sucking mop [ah]
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
(uh) sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive [ah]
ya that [one] really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence [ah] because like I told you earlier on
(err) ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence [lah]
ya
(mm)
the specific (uh) ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well [lah]
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
(mm)
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally [lah] ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya [lah] like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) I think this saturday we we settle (uh) #akid's# (uh) school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare #akid# (uh) school

ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss

direct them [oh] we want this we want this we want this

<malay>dia dengan budak ashraf ini</malay>
<malay>siapa yang cakap ashraf ini</malay>
<malay>habis dia tengok macam alim-alim</malay> type <malay>tak</malay>

[ah]
supporting [lah] ya <malay>dayah yang kena</malay> support [lah]
[ah] <malay>habis apasal</malay> taxi driver
okay
<malay>tapi dayah</malay> but [oh] my lord <malay>macam</malay> like
#dayah# is at the stage of her life that she's driven and <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of aspiration
<malay>habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia</malay> educated <malay>ke atau dia kaya ke</malay> at the end he's just going to be having this (err) aura of like <malay>macam</malay> relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
<malay>nanti tahu tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>berbual pasal ini</malay> okay <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>dia yang nanti belakang hari</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband <malay>lagi</malay> worse <malay>kalau dia</malay> have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character <malay>ke apa</malay> if he has it okay that <malay>macam</malay> he might ask #dayah# to stop working and things like that [lah]
<malay>habis</malay> so you just say that [ah]
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand <malay>pasal</malay>
this whole like family who <malay>yang macam</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu benda orang orang</malay> I don't know family <malay>ke sesiapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang rasa</malay>
[oh] <malay>lebih baik</malay> (err) <malay>halalkan percepatkan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> as if <malay>macam itu ikut sunah nabi</malay> okay they take that part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage but the other part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like <malay>macam</malay> your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody <malay>yang macam</malay> that <malay>macam</malay> is complementary to like your personality
<malay>mana boleh macam</malay> like that [ah] ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack (err) <malay>macam</malay> complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see <malay>macam</malay> that is the thing that <malay>orang</malay> just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part <malay>nak kahwin cepat macam</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>ikut sunah nabi percepatkan</malay> but part part <malay>lain macam</malay>
to get somebody that is competent with you <malay>ini semua tak tak ambil kira</malay> [ah]
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
<malay>habis zina cakap zina macam mana</malay>
(uh) anyway this boy the call you <malay>abang</malay> or what
he should be comfortable with it [lah] <malay>dia ada kakak apa</malay>
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh] so that's when he call you <malay>abang</malay> [ah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
so the conversation <malay>dengan zina</malay> (err) <malay>bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar</malay> it's more of like what what did you say to <malay>zina pasal yang</malay> the growing up and then <malay>pasal pasal</malay> making a <malay>apa</malay> plan <malay>habis pasal apa lagi</malay> like what else did you address
did you say that did you say
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this [ah] <malay>kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena</malay> wake up music just just just use this card
<malay>kata nak kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu</malay> <malay>tengok sampai perempuan agaknya</malay> she will just be fed up one day <malay>tapi betul apa macam</malay>
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect <malay>macam</malay> do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
easy go easy (uh) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> (uh) [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>itu tak ada pendirian</malay> [lah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
no <malay>macam gini</malay> the thing <malay>yang dia nak kena</malay> differentiate is <malay>ada bezanya</malay> easy-going <malay>dan tak ada haluan</malay> this is the thing #zina# you are which one
easy-going <malay>atau</malay> actually you are directionless
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
you said that [ah] <malay>untuk si ashraf ini</malay> [ah] <malay>habis ashraf cakap apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>budak ini pun tahu ke tak</malay> the background of #zina#
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
so this easily two years <malay>baru</malay> meet up <malay>tahu</malay>
!haiya!
I mean I !haiya! I don't know what to feel about this
I mean yes <malay>macam</malay> I am thankful and it's nice to know <malay>budak ini budak baik</malay> (err) so like what #izat# say <malay>kau tengok</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia</malay>
ya [lah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want after this #izat# say !huh! <malay>kau tengok macam aku cakap</malay>
<malay>dia budak baik</malay> I hope #izat# doesn't go like this [lah] ya but anyway
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
ya
send ya
must take this action
<malay>sambil lewa</malay> anyway what I was saying okay
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether (uh) I
I really don't know [lah] this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes <malay>macam</malay> to
push <malay>zina tapi</malay> I don't know if at the end of this product is #zina# will be
pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all #zina# loses <malay>dia punya</malay> identity because this she is she is <malay>macam</malay> dissolving into a very
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
[ah] it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible <malay>lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia</malay> see that I don't know [lah] sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if <malay>macam</malay> she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that <malay>macam</malay> you know like [ah] a woman shall be like <malay>macam</malay> be led by a man that kind of thing and
your life will turn out well
[ah]
at because at some point there will be a point that <malay>macam</malay> she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
no it's not say <malay>tak lepas tangan</malay> it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself [tau] this twentieth (uh) twenty some age
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to #dayah#
<malay>tak pernah tanya dia zina tak pernah tanya</malay>
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
but #dayah# said <malay>yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang</malay> denmark <malay>itu</malay>
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff <malay>orang punya</malay> personal is to us superficial
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
then you <malay>tak cakap macam dengan zina</malay>
at the end of the day #zina# #dayah# is still your sister <malay>macam</malay> you know she still cares for you [lah] then you know like
maybe she you <malay>tak cakap</malay> [lah] why why didn't you say to <malay>zina tadi</malay> like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you <malay>tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu</malay>
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya [lah]
ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya
then <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini</malay> mama and <malay>abah</malay> was there <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> you cannot chat <malay>ini</malay>
!huh!
my why is my recoding still (err) okay you continue <malay>kejap kejap</malay> ya my recording is kind of
[ah] [ah] [ah] where
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay> nevermind <malay>lepas itu</malay> then she say what <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa</malay>
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to #izat# ever since <malay>macam</malay> she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
you said that okay
okay
<malay>habis dia cakap habis dia cakap apa</malay>
and just because #izat# is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue [lah] <malay>cuba kalau</malay> the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies <malay>kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat</malay> will be supportive <malay>pasal apa</malay>
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that <malay>macam</malay> don't say that
you are <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] it's not that she will see all this point
<malay>habis</malay> if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
you said that [ah] then
<malay>habis cakap</malay> you're close to <malay>izat pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>suruh izat tolong</malay> [ah]
<malay>budak ni segan silu</malay> !wow!
ya
but that's because <malay>dia orang</malay> don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to <malay>tolong</malay> them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it [lah]
but it's hard [lah] I mean it's also vary in age age difference <malay>macam</malay> I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
it's very hard and you will often require a certain (mm)
change of life events or certain
[oh] you also cannot engineer it [what] #salim# like <malay>macam</malay> you cannot be bringing the two of them together
<malay>habis</malay> expect <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) to <malay>boleh berbual</malay> like at a very deep level <malay>mana boleh</malay> like it will also feel it's so <malay>janggal macam</malay> it was so it was just feel so weird [lah]

alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] <malay>nampak</malay>
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic <malay>ni berat</malay> [eh] topic <malay>ni</malay> is very this topic is <malay>orang kata</malay> very wide <malay>dia punya</malay> spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is <malay>memang kita boleh</malay> counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
(uh) time <malay>kita berbual</malay>
so okay <malay>kita</malay> start <malay>gini</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay <malay>kau kau</malay> start <malay>dulu apa kau punya</malay> definition of beauty <malay>pada kau</malay>
yes
okay
[oh] that would <malay>tu bagus tu</malay> yes that that is <malay>bagus</malay> (err) <malay>bagus bagus</malay>
for me
for me okay aku</malay>
I don't see myself as <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> victoria's secret <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya ke lawa memang tak</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay> not even near that [lah] but because I I have my insecurities (um) based on appearance <malay>juga</malay> which <malay>itu pun</malay> is another topic [eh] <malay>kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu</malay> about me about
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that <malay>sebab</malay>
standard <malay>kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau</malay> people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
<malay>tapi</malay> for me beauty <malay>kalau kau lawa pun mana pun</malay> but if your if your attitude is <malay>macam gitu</malay> then
then <malay>memang</malay> you know what I mean
<malay>memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan</malay> as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective <malay>ramai orang ada</malay> different <malay>punya</malay> perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[oh] okay for me my <malay>kawan</malay> the friends that I go like the friends that I <malay>cari atau dapat</malay> it's okay we we can talk about poly ya <malay>kita punya</malay> poly days is <malay>kita tak</malay> I I don't see like [oh] <malay>kau lawa</malay> I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kau lawa</malay> I was going to say you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean I don't know for me <malay>memang</malay> I don't see
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
go towards that <malay>sebab</malay> it's not gonna be a genuine <malay>punya</malay> relationship you know
<malay>sebab</malay> it's just gonna be
for clout <malay>macam</malay> you know you know some people (uh) there there is some (uh) cliques <malay>ke apa</malay> whatever in school <malay>yang macam</malay> okay <malay>sebab kau lawa kau</malay> popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame <malay>dia ada</malay> attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is <malay>memang</malay> maybe not because during after <malay>kalau</malay> your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person <malay>yang macam</malay> will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
<malay>macam</malay> for me and you [eh] <malay>macam</malay> this is <malay>kita pun semalam baru jumpa</malay> [eh] we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like <malay>kita punya</malay> relationship first first <malay>kita</malay> start from sec one
and until now it last <malay>ramai</malay> of my other friends <malay>macam kita dah macam</malay> you know after that <malay>macam dah</malay> start to <malay>putik putus</malay> but with you and (err) (err) our friends yesterday it is a long lasting <malay>macam kita tak</malay> awkward [tau] and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know <malay>kita punya</malay> chemistry <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour
<malay>kita punya</malay> personality because okay imagine <malay>kalau</malay> the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine <malay>kita takde macam makan orang makan orang</malay> you know what I mean like like betray or
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
<malay>tak payah cari</malay> beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any <malay>betul tak tu</malay>
<malay>apa kau rasa apa kau rasa</malay>
<malay>cerita sikit cerita sikit</malay>
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course <malay>pun ada juga yang</malay> those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) <malay>lelaki kat dalam</malay> my course <malay>yang baik yang</malay> humble <malay>yang tahu yang dia orang tak</malay> stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they they <malay>dia orang punya dia orang macam</malay> you know they have that that beauty standard [lah] <malay>dia orang ada</malay> that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are <malay>sombong</malay> they are arrogant you know
so so <malay>macam</malay> it's a
I don't know (err) <malay>macam</malay> for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say <malay>kalau kau lawa</malay> you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality <malay>pun kena bagus</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> but but people people who are <malay>lawa</malay> usually you know you know <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna <malay>ada</malay> that ego you know that ego that that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] I would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always <malay>kalau</malay> it's always <malay>macam</malay> you see this (um)
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
not just competition but <malay>macam</malay> okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that <malay>macam sebab</malay> this person is sexy <malay>ke apa ada</malay> landed job
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
I mean that is for us <malay>yang mungkin macam</malay> of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role
(mm)
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
<malay>betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur</malay> [eh] I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our <malay>macam</malay> okay in the future <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak cari</malay> (um)
a a partner in life your (uh)
is beauty important <malay>macam</malay> appearance wise or the best is <malay>macam</malay> mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya <malay>tu memang tu memang tu memang</malay>
ada yang suka</malay> cute cute <malay>ada yang suka macam</malay> E-boy E-boy
true true true true
(uh) no (err) not not not the first (uh) judgement because because first judgement <malay>memang</malay> is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall <malay>macam</malay> to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
me too me too
I think I think
okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kau kau</malay> share <malay>kau</malay> share <malay>dulu</malay> cause <malay>ni pun</malay> (uh) is an interesting fact
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> the the act of (uh) sharing <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) caring the your you <malay>punya</malay> personality that is beautiful so
<malay>macam</malay> I think beauty [eh] is is
is again subjective <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>ada orang</malay> [eh] they say <malay>macam asalkan kau kemas</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau</malay> (err) you are clean you clean yourself <malay>macam</malay> it <malay>macam bukanlah</malay> you I'm asking you <malay>macam pergi</malay> plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
(uh) I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but but overall <malay>macam</malay> the of how you take care of yourself <malay>macam</malay> for the <malay>macam kita</malay> how we how we like its like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we <malay>kita basuh muka</malay> something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> beauty [eh] is again <malay>macam</malay> very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know (uh) I I got this <malay>macam macam</malay> experience <malay>kalau</malay> we we talk with our friends <malay>ke apa</malay> we always like <malay>ada juga</malay> topic topic <malay>yang macam ini maknanya macam</malay> anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's it's about (um) <malay>macam</malay> low self esteem you know <malay>kau ada</malay> face <malay>gitu tak aku ada</malay> I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that <malay>macam</malay> to me I find that
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
<malay>macam kau</malay> do do you have any like (um)
insecurities <malay>ataupun macam</malay> low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
I <malay>pun sama</malay>
handsome
<malay>sama sama sama sama</malay> for me <malay>sama</malay> (err) like I think
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
unless <malay>kita kes yang macam</malay> our confidence level is very high ya but of course
<malay>terdetik</malay> [lah] <malay>kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang</malay> very <malay>kita rasa macam</malay> [eh] !alamak! you know what I mean
ya
I I came across this one (uh) (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says <malay>macam</malay> the kid was saying (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
okay but I think <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>pun times <malay>yang</malay> I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset <malay>sebab</malay> that means [eh]
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if I'm beauty
if I'm (uh) pretty I will get somewhere I would get (uh) at least a modelling job <malay>ke apa</malay> you know at least I have something <malay>tapi</malay>
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
<malay>tapi okay <malay>siapa tak nak lawa</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa tak nak</malay> handsome <malay>buat apa dalam dunia ni</malay>
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) <malay>tadi nak tanya tanya seribu</malay> question <malay>boleh</malay>
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
I think [kan] for me okay <malay>kita kita perempuan</malay> [kan] but I I think (um) generally generally speaking [kan] I think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective subjective but but I think [kan] it's more towards the girls <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we have like boys and girls is different [what] <malay>kita punya</malay> how we hangout how we
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
<malay>pergi</malay> towards that that
that <malay>apa tu tujuan</malay> like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you <malay>apa</malay> to you which one for you
ya
really
practical
(mm)
ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which <malay>macam</malay> for for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that I mean [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] have you heard this about I heard about <malay>macam</malay> some of my friends (uh) classmate <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok tu</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok dia ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok</malay> you know they we they are always <malay>macam</malay>
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic <malay>yang</malay>
for you know me and you <malay>kita tak kita</malay> we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
<malay>kaum wanita</malay> [lah] it's always <malay>kaum wanita</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention <malay>macam orang yang tak lawa</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> but it's <malay>kini</malay> it's how society <malay>pandang</malay> you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know <malay>sebab</malay> this is how society looks <malay>sebab</malay> to be honest who started this thing called <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) okay (uh) <malay>kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau</malay> if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing <malay>mesti ada dulu</malay> maybe in history <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>macam ni</malay> I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say <malay>ni lumrah manusia</malay> [tau] you know <malay>kau tahu benda ni macam</malay> this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually <malay>kalau kalau</malay> we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem <malay>sebab</malay> it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
<malay>macam</malay> okay I'm not gonna I'm not <malay>sebab</malay> you get it's subjective it depends some <malay>ada</malay> some parts of the world <malay>takde macam gini</malay> but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
that is very <malay>macam sebab</malay> it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning [what] that's why <malay>ramai orang macam ada yang</malay> every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
<malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> you <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] it it can be because maybe <malay>sebab</malay> (uh) you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you [what] <malay>betul</malay> [what] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak kacau kau apa</malay> or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing <malay>ke</malay> based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also about also <malay>macam</malay> status
hierarchy system <malay>macam kaya</malay> and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia</malay> it's all (uh) human standards
which I think is
is is <malay>tak berapa bagus</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
not just beauty [tau] <malay>macam pasal</malay> poor and rich <malay>pun boleh jadi</malay> problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen (uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam budak budak ada yang kena</malay> outcast [kan] you know what I mean
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
[oh] dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that <malay>macam</malay> (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
ya competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] like
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
<malay>takkan semua sama</malay> right <malay>pekerja</malay> then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
true true true so <malay>memang ini</malay>
lumrah</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>memang memang</malay> it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest <malay>mesti</malay> there is there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam kau tahu</malay> okay (uh) <malay>dunia hiburan</malay>
about okay (uh) western world <malay>atau</malay> K pop [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for example that kind of thing
usually <malay>yang lawa</malay> [jer] <malay>pun yang disanjung disanjung</malay> <malay>disanjung</malay>
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean <malay>punya</malay>
the K pop world you know what I mean <malay>sebab</malay> in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we we we judge based on (uh) music wise <malay>kalau kita suka kita suka macam</malay> for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> okay (uh) like
<malay>tak</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay> it's different <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> compare we cannot compare like western <malay>punya</malay> industry like the hollywood and and also K pop <malay>sebab</malay> K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol <malay>atau</malay> the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like of <malay>kau pernah kau pernah</malay> (uh) come across this article <malay>tak dia macam</malay> there's this one idol <malay>dia punya</malay> member <malay>tak berapa lawa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
to me it's fine [lah] but it's <malay>ada sikit macam</malay> different <malay>daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa</malay> then all the all the <malay>macam</malay> the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is <malay>tak tak</malay> not of a pretty <malay>tapi</malay> is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so I think that is also <malay>rabak</malay> [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] <malay>memilih kasih padahal sama</malay> group [tau] <malay>padahal</malay> they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like like why <malay>sanjung</malay> (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people <malay>sebab ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay> news turns out that [oh] this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans <malay>tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu</malay> the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it <malay>betul apa</malay>
(uh) same like macam
<malay>macam</malay> you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish <malay>tapi</malay> okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
beauty [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness <malay>ke</malay> based on their face <malay>ke</malay> or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards (uh) bad <malay>punya</malay>
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the <malay>macam</malay> those those fans <malay>yang sanjung sangat</malay> [kan] it's not (uh) it's not it's not a good habit for them [what] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like <malay>macam</malay> harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
<malay>macam kau tak payah ada</malay> beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
<malay>tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> (um) oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the <malay>lawa</malay> the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting <malay>punya</malay> and she can be successful you know what I mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
<malay>yang benda apa tu yang benda</malay>
<malay>yang benda</malay> (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true true
it also goes with <malay>macam</malay> top (uh) fashion wise you know what I mean
<malay>macam kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> (uh) okay <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
<malay>macam</malay> T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then <malay>kita pergi kedai mamak</malay> something like that right
<malay>kedai</malay> (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think <malay>macam</malay> they they will look at us like [eh] <malay>dia ni biar betul</malay> you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where <malay>kita kita</malay> I'm gonna feel <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
<malay>tapi</malay> get it it's it's how era goes you know <malay>sebab zaman dulu</malay> imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right <malay>dulu</malay> time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you <malay>biar betul</malay>
<malay>lain macam</malay> but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau lawa macam</malay> it's fine
so see how this (uh) the the era <malay>macam</malay> how (uh) move [eh] you know what I mean
<malay>lain</malay> [eh] which is weird [eh] <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir</malay> !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) better and more (uh)
<malay>orang kata apa lagi gempak</malay> then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean (um) ya ya ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in <malay>macam</malay> those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters <malay>dia orang nak</malay> step [jer] <malay>macam</malay> they just follow the trend you know what I mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I think there is like <malay>macam</malay> photos trend I guess <malay>kita kita</malay> use simpler (uh) simpler terms [eh]
I would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
as you know <malay>macam</malay> around starting to see because here I feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what I mean <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) <malay>macam</malay> instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) <malay>macam</malay> pinterest (uh)
<malay>dulu</malay> tumblr okay tiktok <malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's <malay>punya</malay> life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols <malay>ke</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>punya</malay> artist (uh) kim K <malay>ke</malay> whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so <malay>maknanya</malay>
due to that that's why (uh) people are like following <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl <malay>tapi</malay> you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
<malay>tapi</malay> to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing (err) you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like <malay>suka dia punya</malay> style <malay>macam</malay> some people you can we see [oh] I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means <malay>tapi</malay> you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya <malay>macam</malay> that is that is not the right way <malay>sebab macam kau kena</malay> genuine with yourself [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
imagine you are not like that right <malay>tapi sebab kau nampak</malay> (uh) your maybe your cliques are all <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine <malay>tapi</malay> you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company <malay>tapi</malay> if you start to <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>maaf cakap</malay> [eh] this can be very sensitive <malay>sebab</malay> imagine if your circle of friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>buat</malay>
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right <malay>macam</malay> you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in <malay>macam</malay>
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I I say you don't need to get okay <malay>macam mana kau nak</malay> get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what I mean
so <malay>macam</malay> you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying <malay>macam</malay> (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset <malay>tapi</malay> you you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's <malay>macam kau</malay>
needs a level up you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> level of for the good
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like see this is how (uh) trend setting <malay>macam</malay>
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the K pop
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it <malay>tapi</malay> if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later <malay>tapi</malay> if you follow that kind of group <malay>yang buat benda tak elok</malay> then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean <malay>kau punya</malay> pride <malay>kau tak payah</malay> follow <malay>orang lain punya orang lain punya</malay> instruction <malay>ada betul</malay>
<malay>boleh boleh boleh</malay> shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
<malay>pandang rendah</malay> is it <malay>pandang rendah</malay> you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand <malay>macam mana</malay> you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group <malay>macam tadi kau cakap</malay>
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead <malay>macam</malay> if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your <malay>macam</malay> it will lead you to a success <malay>atau macam</malay> lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead <malay>sebab</malay> if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's <malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends you know what I mean like quotation <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends <malay>punya pasal</malay> then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good <malay>tujuan sebab kalau kau</malay> really <malay>nak</malay>
I mean you know some people <malay>macam</malay> for me no [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for me I got this thing where
<malay>kalau aku takde kawan</malay> then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
<malay>kita nampak</malay> I've I've I've seen this
where
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the group [kan] <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the clique and then <malay>dia cari orang lain</malay> immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much <malay>macam</malay> you like like <malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own (uh) <malay>pendirian daripada</malay>
I I think (uh) I need to find I need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think <malay>nanti macam</malay> I got problem
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question <malay>tadi</malay> whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so <malay>sebab</malay> if the loner if that loner sometimes loner <malay>tu</malay> feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I <malay>kita</malay> support <malay>aku</malay> support <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] <malay>kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan</malay> you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
<malay>sebab</malay> if you want to go for me [eh] <malay>aku aku</malay> I like to keep my circle of friends close <malay>macam</malay> just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know <malay>sebab</malay> to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
you know <malay>kawan kosong</malay> and <malay>kawan</malay> that is really true
ya so back to your question where <malay>kalau</malay> the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but <malay>kalau</malay> you it's hard it's hard to say <malay>macam</malay> for me you know I just say but if I were to
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
<malay>tapi</malay> what I I can advice <malay>macam</malay>
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
<malay>tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab</malay> they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
<malay>dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau</malay> they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
<malay>kau kalau kau macam mana</malay>
yes I I still remember our first our first
<malay>macam</malay> you you know <malay>kita aku</malay> case <malay>macam</malay> the clown [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the <malay>kita ni ni macam</malay> podcast [eh] <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay for those who <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert <malay>macam</malay> I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met #mahirah# [kan] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> [tau] but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>mahirah aku</malay>
ya it take a long time not years [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no <malay>aku</malay> respect <malay>kau sebab</malay> okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful <malay>kau</malay>

<malay>kau</malay> chairperson [seh] <malay>kau</malay> your leadership skill is really <malay>aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik</malay> (err) <malay>sebab</malay> your leadership is the best
so and

ya so role model
the is that <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you want to say like like western <malay>punya</malay> or like <malay>macam barat</malay>
(uh) <malay>pelakon ke apa</malay> [kan] then I would say #neelofa#
#neelofa# #neelofa#
is the ya malaysian <malay>punya</malay> actress host (uh) business woman <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kau tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia buat</malay> this brand <malay>apa yang neelofa punya tudung</malay> and then she's she's she's successful <malay>sampai pergi</malay> (uh)
milan (uh) to the the business <malay>berkembang</malay>
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something <malay>dia masih belum berpunya</malay> she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both <malay>dunia</malay> and <malay>akhirat aku boleh cakap</malay>
it's it's like !wah! <malay>macam</malay>
it's something that <malay>macam</malay> you god bless you you know
ya I take that as a as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing <malay>apa tadi kau nak cakap</malay>
#wallah#
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> the I mean the the the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya <malay>tu</malay> [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! I think <malay>memang</malay> it's very rare no not just both <malay>tapi</malay> your character <malay>pun baik</malay> your personality <malay>pun baik</malay>
those who have that
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost <malay>macam</malay>
role model [lah] I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man <malay>yang macam</malay> you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) <malay>bekerjaya</malay> and (um) (uh) <malay>apa</malay> we can <malay>cakap apa</malay> faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
<malay>memang susah nak cari</malay> but these are the people <malay>yang macam</malay> you <malay>risau tapi</malay> again to those <malay>yang kita</malay> okay <malay>kita boleh (uh) <malay>rumuskan</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> we got like a few more minutes <malay>tapi</malay> (um) what I can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] I want to say that this <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kita kita jangan</malay> just <malay>tengok yang lawa kita</malay> just <malay>tengok yang</malay> handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance <malay>sebab</malay>
it will just make you <malay>rasa diri</malay> you <malay>yang kalau</malay> you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we <malay>atau</malay> whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this <malay>macam</malay> successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself <malay>kalau</malay> just you know what I mean like
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
<malay>betul</malay> you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of (uh) just be humble be kind I think <malay>kalau</malay> at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character <malay>betul tak</malay>
so just ya just be on that don't worry <malay>kalau</malay>
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly <malay>macam</malay> choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you <malay>macam</malay> you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know <malay>bila</malay>
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
so then you just be humble [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then <malay>baru kita</malay> move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
<malay>macam</malay> it it it has come to a point where
<malay>macam</malay> because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself <malay>ni macam takde</malay> value
and it has come to a point where <malay>macam</malay> whatever people take one for me <malay>aku macam mengalah aku</malay> like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
to have like prioritise in me <malay>sebab</malay> I I tend to like
to like <malay>macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang</malay> [seh]
you know what I mean so it has I should be more <malay>macam</malay> have that confidence which I I <malay>aku tu tu</malay> last time [eh] <malay>tu</malay> last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
(uh) the respect that you you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road <malay>apa kau punya</malay> advice
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
true true that is that is important and <malay>macam</malay> to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
<malay>ni</malay> is important <malay>betul</malay> okay
ellen <malay>punya</malay> ellen put aside [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> this is my <malay>pendirian</malay> I know where
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status <malay>kau</malay> manager your <malay>kau</malay> they treat me they treat us <malay>macam kita ni</malay> beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I <malay>aku macam</malay> to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day <malay>aku</malay>
have my own (uh) business or I I'm (uh) I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must <malay>sebab</malay> how can you judge <malay>sebab</malay> I got people around me <malay>macam</malay> they they judge okay for example
<malay>kalau kau punya</malay> job (uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) cleaning wise <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
I mean you shouldn't judge
<malay>kau</malay> why would you (uh) I've seen this this is another topic (err) like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern [eh] I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) <malay>kita</malay> they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) <malay>kuli</malay> we are like beginner
<malay>kita macam baru masuk</malay> industry then they they they bully us they they not just (uh) okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment <malay>tapi</malay> if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like <malay>macam kita sampah</malay> or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like [oh] my god you you you you forget where you where you start you <malay>kau kau dah lupa diri</malay> [kan] this is what happen when <malay>kita lupa diri</malay> so I I I just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please
#nadia# don't ever <malay>lupa diri sebab</malay> one day <malay>kalau</malay> I get that extra money <malay>ke</malay> I get that extra title <malay>ke</malay> I might forget about myself and people below me
bad which I don't want that to happen and
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know <malay>bila</malay> this (uh) blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's (uh)
that's a wrap

three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
(mm)
next year <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I <malay>nak gi</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
because <malay>sekarang</malay>
[kan] australia <malay>punya</malay> borders (err) <malay>rasa rasanya dalam</malay> Berita Harian <malay> dah tertulis</malay>
they <malay>tutup sampai</malay>
<malay>tahun</malay> twenty twenty one
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>betul ke</malay> and you <malay>tak pernah</malay> visit
you should you should so then <malay>macam mana dengan</malay>
(mm) okay so because [kan] you are the type of
person that <malay>suka</malay> holiday <malay>suka keluar</malay> (err)
for new adventure <malay>tengok</malay> new adventure see new things so during
(err) <malay>tahun ni</malay> [kan] <malay>semasa</malay> lockdown (uh) <malay>semasa</malay> COVID you <malay>ada rasa macam</malay> you
you suffocating a bit <malay>ke tak</malay> like you know (um) like you cannot go on holiday you <malay>ada rasa macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room <malay>dengan ni</malay> house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so <malay>tak rasa macam</malay> lonely <malay>sangat</malay> [lah]
because <malay>sebelum ni</malay> [kan]
you <malay>memang tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>memasak langsung</malay> so I didn't know how to cook (um) <malay>nasi pun tak tahu</malay> [lor] so then it's like
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [lah]
then I had to <malay>macam</malay> ask
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook [lah] so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things [lah] so I felt like
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I <malay>tinggal dengan mereka</malay> [lah] at that time [ah]
<malay>boleh boleh makan</malay> [lah] but then there was this one time <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>masak</malay> (uh) <malay>kari ikan</malay>
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon [lah] then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
(uh)
salmon salmon I okay <malay>boleh makan tapi</malay> curry <malay>dia</malay> I think <malay>sebab</malay> I added too much water
so <malay>rasa dia macam air</malay> instead of or is <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> salmon soup instead of salmon curry [lah]
so it was a bit weird [lah] ya
I know right [oh] my gosh ya
!hais! you <malay>tahu tak hari tu</malay> because I'm thinking to myself
that you <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>memang</malay> drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking <malay>hari tu</malay> [kan] you know outside <malay>rumah</malay> I <malay>ni</malay> I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
enjoying my sleep [lah]
then after that [leh]
the car outside [kan]
<malay>dia</malay> accident
<malay>betapa kuatnya</malay> I heard bang
and I was like <malay>apa jadi</malay> [ah]
the but then I try to look out the window [lah] I wanted to #kaypoh# [lor]
look out the window but then <malay>tak nampak apa apa</malay> then <malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>ternampak</malay>
<malay>memang yang</malay> accident <malay>tu teruk</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan motosikal</malay>
then <malay>kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai</malay> the whole thing is spoilt [lah]
<malay>kemek</malay> already crash already [lah]
and (uh)
ya so then after that few minutes later you can <malay>terdengar</malay> [lah] ambulance <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so ya like that [lor]
so that's what happened
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tapi</malay> you <malay>pernah kena</malay> accident <malay>tak</malay>
so far <malay>pernah</malay>
then after that
[oh]
<malay>tak henti</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul juga</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>apa yang dia tertulis</malay>

I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>ada nampak</malay>
video <malay>tu</malay> [kan] I think ya no <malay>bukan nampak kereta dia kat</malay> #tampines# <malay>tapi</malay> I think I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay> video <malay>dia kat</malay> TikTok
<malay>sebab biasanya</malay> usually <malay>kalau ada</malay> accident <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan</malay> upload <malay>dalam</malay> TikTok
so that's where I get my news also [lah] TikTok and Instagram
ya
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] so talking about the news (um) do you follow <malay>tak</malay> the the <malay>punya</malay> politician <malay>semua</malay>
the presidential debate
(mm) I <malay>nampak tapi</malay> I <malay>macam tak faham</malay>
ya so
<malay>faham</malay> [lah]
I understand
so ya so then [kan]
[ah] you know actually this year
<malay>sepatutnya</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> !hais!
you know <malay>kena</malay> save money [lah]
save money so that I can like buy a house here
and then you know (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the houses here <malay>pun sekarang</malay>
getting more expensive and <malay>kalau tak</malay> I <malay>kena</malay> you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak pandu kereta</malay> [kan]
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] [eh] you <malay>ada</malay> siblings <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>adik</malay>
[oh] I <malay>tak tahu pun</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> siblings
[ah] okay
okay so your big brother <malay>buat apa</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] [oh] that's very good
okay
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] I <malay>ni</malay> [kan] only child
ya
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I <malay>kena</malay> take care of them [lah]
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] they are walking around in singapore
so then it's like
I <malay>takut</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada apa apa yang jadi</malay> especially <malay>bila</malay> that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] parents <malay>ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni</malay> [kan]
<malay>bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni</malay> [kan] COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
<malay>risiko tinggi</malay> [kan] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>keluar sebab</malay>
it's like if you have in the reports [kan] it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
<malay>macam</malay> diabetes high cholesterol
you know or (uh)
(err) like <malay>macam mak</malay> I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous [lah] to to <malay>bahaya</malay> [lah] to go out
and actually touch all these
things in public [kan] and taking the public transport and <malay>dia ambil</malay> <malay>juga</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
so that's why <malay>memang tak nak dengar</malay> [lah] so <malay>susah sikit</malay> [lah] so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is <malay>sudah semakin kurang</malay>
so <malay>nampaknya macam</malay> okay we're getting better
and looking forward to phase three [lah]
but then you <malay>tahu tak</malay> what is the difference between phase three <malay>dengan</malay> phase two <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
okay
ya
[oh]
(mm)
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>yang tu</malay> [jer]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> activity <malay>tu</malay> not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
ya
[ah] <malay>betul juga</malay>
ya [lor] that's true
but then like travel bubble <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh cadangkan</malay> travel bubble you <malay>rasa</malay> travel bubble <malay>dengan siapa</malay>
if let's say you were the prime minister
you get to pick five countries <malay>yang mana lima</malay> country <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>rasa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
you <malay>nak</malay> travel bubble <malay>dengan</malay>
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> philippines <malay>dengan</malay> indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is (uh) <malay>dengan</malay> indonesia
ya because the two of them <malay>sekarang ni memang tengah</malay> competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
of the highest number of COVID cases
so <malay>rasa macam</malay> I don't I would not feel safe <malay>kalau</malay> we have travel bubble <malay>dengan mereka</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] new zealand new zealand is good ya <malay>memang cantik</malay> and I heard the prime minister is very good also (mm)
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases [lah] <malay>di</malay> <malay>di negara dia</malay> [kan]
ya
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] so <malay>biasanya</malay> you <malay>ada baca</malay> news [kan] Channel News Asia
(mm)
okay
<malay>yang macam mana yang ada apa</malay> like
<malay>apa</malay> rapist <malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> Channel News Asia they reported that [oh] my god that is so sad [kan]

(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya
<malay>esok</malay> (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> !aiyo! so everytime
(uh) <malay>kerja memang kerja</malay> from work from home [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> once I think about <malay>kerja</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> stressed <malay>sikit</malay> because I've been working twenty four seven
so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I need a break [lah]
ya
as if [lah] it's so easy [kan]
I <malay>tak boleh</malay> visit <malay>rumah orang tua</malay> [lah] [sia] COVID
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> visit <malay>orang tua tak boleh</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)

so ya
so then
so today
my house mate [kan] <malay>dia balik</malay>
then <malay>dia tidur kat sini</malay>
boyfriend <malay>dia tak ada</malay> so boyfriend <malay>dia</malay> <malay>tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri</malay> [lah] so

<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>nak duduk</malay> Vespa <malay>kalau</malay> public transportation <malay>memang ada</malay> air con
so then I was like a bit like
then <malay>tapi</malay> ya so no [lah] but it's not just that it was like I <malay>dah memang dah bagi tahu yang</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend
<malay>tapi dia masih muka tebal</malay> [tau] and then <malay>dia masih</malay> text I so I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest <malay>dengan dia</malay> and I <malay>bagi tahu</malay> [lah] that like
(um) I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have (err) to go (uh) with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
[ah] so I <malay>rasa macam dia tak ada</malay> boundary actually the thing was
I only save <malay>nombor dia sebab dia cakap</malay>
that <malay>kalau</malay> next time I <malay>nak</malay> reserve table I <malay>boleh</malay> call <malay>dia</malay> so I <malay>ingat</malay> like service <malay>dia bagus ke apa</malay> I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
<malay>kat</malay> Holey Moley <malay>yang dia ni memang baik ke apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> turns out <malay>dia ni memang tak</malay> like like
<malay>asyik kacau</malay> I [jer] so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> a bit
weirded out
(mm) <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
(uh) <malay>saya rasa</malay> I <malay>saya tak nak</malay>
I <malay>memang dah berterus terang</malay> I <malay>dah cakap</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend
then after that <malay>dia</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap</malay> [oh]
(um)
<malay>dia cakap</malay>
[oh] (um) I okay [jer] (uh) because <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh]

I <malay>tahu</malay> you you you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak nak</malay> hang out one on one
<malay>tapi</malay> I okay [jer]
then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the way he responded to it was very
(mm) disrespectful because it's like
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it <malay>ke tidak</malay> because you are
like
you know (um) single so of course it's okay with you
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>atau</malay> girlfriend I don't think it's
it's nice of you to do that
[ah] so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
then then <malay>aku tanya dia</malay> just you and I then <malay>dia cakap tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan kawan</malay> I
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
<malay>aku cakap terus terang dah</malay>
[ah]
<malay>tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> birthday dinner
<malay>pas tu</malay> I <malay>cakap</malay>

but not when I am free
so I was but <malay>bukan</malay> I <malay>yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak</malay> I then I was like
okay
then I said [oh] weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
<malay>mungkin</malay> you <malay>kena panggil</malay> (uh) then I said (err) maybe you just enjoy with your friends [lah] and have a good
time and and happy birthday in advance
<malay>pas tu dia cakap</malay> (um)
<malay>dia cakap</malay> (err)
(um)
[oh] (uh) don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
<malay>bila</malay> I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I <malay>dah cakap</malay>
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
[a'ah]
I <malay>memang dah tak bagi</malay> signal <malay>apa</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> (uh) it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
okay
so ya
so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's just
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
ya but any way <malay>aku dah tak</malay> reply <malay>dia</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya <malay>betul juga</malay>
ya
<malay>kali pertama</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>dah pernah</malay> happen a number of times
!huh!
no [lah] I mean (uh) no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this (um) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so (um)
<malay>kalau tahu tak</malay>
in london COVID nineteen <malay>memang dah</malay> (um)
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
(mm) <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>dalam kat</malay> australia
(mm)
so they are all back in lockdown
(mm)
(mm) I think so
(mm)
(mm) <malay>yang tu pernah</malay> happen <malay>dalam</malay> japan <malay>pun</malay> and then now they said that the
the virus <malay>dah</malay> mutate
and the infection is is more (um)
the the virus is more infectious
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul juga</malay> but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so <malay>yang tu yang susah</malay> [lah]
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> vaccine <malay>sekarang pun macam ada</malay> side effect
because I think <malay>sekarang ada tiga</malay> company <malay>yang tengah buat</malay> vaccine
(uh)
no there is one that's Sanofi albert <malay>dengan</malay> AstraZeneca
Pfizer <malay>juga</malay> I think all of them are on board with that <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni</malay> albert <malay>memang memang apa ni</malay> (uh) <malay>memang</malay> aggressive to to do COVID because I <malay>nampak ada</malay>
job offers
for a number of (um) albert <malay>punya</malay> infectious disease department
(mm)
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dia tak</malay> call I <malay>balik</malay> because I <malay>tak ada</malay> experience <malay>dalam</malay> infectious disease <malay>kot</malay>
(mm)
ya
<malay>mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana</malay> [lah]
you
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
become prolonged because
(err)
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
(uh) nationwide
<malay>yang</malay> U <malay>orang</malay> <malay>dengan dengan</malay> like
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
so that's why it turns out everybody <malay>pula yang terkena</malay> COVID
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang ni</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya
<malay>betul</malay>

<malay>minggu ni boleh juga</malay>
okay thank you bye bye

[eh] bro long time no see [ah]
not that [ah] actually cause I just got sacked [ah] by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
ya that was back then [lah] but <malay>sekarang dah kena buang</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak ada guna</malay> [ah] <malay>nak tengok tu semua balik</malay>
(err) around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful [lah] cause
I got to travel to different countries [ah]
among all the countries I would say
(uh) saudi arabia cause (uh) it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
so <malay>aku rasa lebih aman</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
[ah] saudi arabia [ah] #mecca# <malay>rasanya kat</malay> #mecca# <malay>sana semua</malay>
no <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>apa pasal</malay> corruption <malay>ni semua tapi</malay> I did read over the news that (uh) ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself [ah] but then
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion [lah]
(err)
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
(uh) finding [oh] discovering new food there the arabic food was
amazing I would say <malay>sebab dorangnya</malay> taste
a bit different from asian <malay>nya</malay> culture <malay>dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit</malay> [lah] and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I would say I would want to go to
spain [ah] cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
(err) I want to go to #barcelona# cause
I will to get a chance to meet #messi# [ah] you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>disebabkan</malay> COVID period [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay> no chance [lah] <malay>nak gi sana nak jumpa atau</malay> maybe <malay>kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada</malay> chance <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau</malay> in singapore
so far <malay>aku rasa dorang dah main dah</malay> start <malay>main cuma</malay> it's just that no [ah] spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will [ah] suffer a lot of loss [ah] cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue [lah]
actually <malay>tu yang aku pelik</malay> [ah] but then (uh) I did make a research [ah] on the internet and I found out that (uh) they make money through (uh) fans memberships the merchandises like example (err) <malay>satu apa ni baju bola</malay> [kan] they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe [what] so <malay>kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin</malay> they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover [lah] you know before the
whole (uh) football period (uh) resumes
(uh)
ya <malay>aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat</malay> facebook <malay>apa semua</malay> especially in singapore (err) aviation <malay>macam-macam kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya</malay> (err) <malay>kita tengok</malay> singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial [ah] aids to (um) singaporeans [ah]
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang aku</malay> rest [jer] <malay>kat rumah sebab</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> to stay close [ah] with my family
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective [lah] but I would say it's hard [lah] [ah] you know to find a job that [ah] that is suitable with me <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit</malay> savings <malay>aku</malay> [ah] <malay>alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat</malay> save for the past (err)
months that I've been working as air steward <malay>kalau tak mungkin aku kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>cari mana-mana kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>risau juga cuma</malay>
<malay>alhamdulillah</malay> again <malay>aku dapat</malay> save quite a lot
I mean <malay>aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau</malay> [kan] but then ya I would (err) the savings that I save
probably can last me for six months [ah] if I really (err) spend accordingly and safely [lah] and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
[oh] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku baca hari tu kat</malay> facebook <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa kerja</malay> as a swabber is it they could earn like
four thousand !wah! that I think that's a lot [eh] for a part-time job
maybe cause (err) they are finding people who are willing to work (uh) a risk a risky job [lah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> they are willing to pay that much
<malay>tapi</malay> to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer [lah] <malay>sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi</malay> maybe it's better if government pay them [lah] you know
[oh] I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
(uh) moving forward
it will be a tough period [lah] for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera [lah] you know <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>nak cakap susah memang</malay> [lah] <malay>susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> wonder on how singapore would cope with this (um) COVID nineteen [lah]
(mm)
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs [lah] you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that [lah] cause as we (um) you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
(err) the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
and <malay>tu pasal aku rasa penting</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> plan [lah] <malay>untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada</malay> family <malay>atau beli rumah aku rasa</malay>
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important [ah] in singapore
(uh) ya I get that a lot [lah] I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
(err) it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
(err) you know a lot of children I don't know [lah] maybe for them it's a <malay>rezeki</malay> but in terms of singapore context
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you [lah] but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided (err) you are not doing overtime or what [lah]
so ya two thousand is not enough [lah] at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that (err) or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling [lah] you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and (um) the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them [eh] sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children [lah] you know maybe
for (err)
primary school children [kan] <malay>tak payah bayar</malay> school fees <malay>ke</malay> or maybe edusave <malay>bagi lebih banyak sikit ke</malay> you know
ya I really agree on that [lah] we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know (err)
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right !wah! my house [ah] I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you [lah] to [ah] hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time [eh] you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
(uh) this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news [lah] I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry [lah] to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree [ah] there are multiple aspects that (um) lead to (err) emotional (err) depression
or probably (um)
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right (um) financial
(uh) issues I think is the most depressing issue [lah]
you know cause
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this <malay>aku kadang-kadang pening</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku dapat gaji</malay> [jer] <malay>aku kena kasi</malay>
<malay>apa ni adik-adik aku</malay> [eh] sorry <malay>adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar</malay> bill <malay>aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi</malay> [ah] then <malay>aku kadang-kadang</malay> barely <malay>aku cuma ada kadang-kadang</malay> five hundred for myself like in every month
so <malay>walaupun</malay> I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with !wah! sorry with whatever I'm having [lah] you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period [lah] for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
I mean I sometimes I really wonder <malay>macam mana orang-orang yang</malay> (err) <malay>sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak</malay> [lah] you know <malay>rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar</malay> [tau] <malay>dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar</malay> bill
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think [ah] I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very (uh) depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also (err) came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID [lah] I mean some people
(err) actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why [lah] I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything [lah] that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
(um) hold the border
to some (uh) high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news [lah] maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
(uh) explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the (uh) about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
being raped which I'm totally (uh) angry about <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk</malay> singapore <malay>mungkin kalau aku</malay> ironman <malay>mungkin aku akan pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku nak</malay> save <malay>dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau</malay> (err) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>sedara kau sendiri</malay>
(uh) was tortured was raped in front of other people
(uh)
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's (err) moral morally right [lah] I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
<malay>tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi</malay>
<malay>ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua</malay> I really
(err) don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say (uh) history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being (uh) killed
(err) you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
(err)
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
ya I really (err) I'm really disappointed that (um) the muslims are treated that way and also another case is <malay>sekarang ni</malay> happening in this world is
(err) I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really (err)
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community [ah] be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it (err) it (err) really (err) bring a hole
(uh) present representation of the whole community and as you can see in [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kenapa</malay> police <malay>dorang</malay> (err)
<malay>apa</malay> treat all those (uh) black people with such violence and brutality
where recently <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> news (err) <malay>satu orang dorang siapa nama dia</malay> george floyd was killed
intentionally in front of people !wah! that was another level of murder I would say [lah]
(err) <malay>aku tak tahu apa yang tak</malay>
police police <malay>tu fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa</malay> (err) <malay>orang tu dia setakat</malay> (err) <malay>apa ni ada</malay> fake <malay>duit</malay> [jer] which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
(err) we did have I mean we do have (uh) casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it [lah]
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such (uh) racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
<malay>aku rasa dalam negara ni</malay>
(err) <malay>orang masih boleh</malay> you know <malay>kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma</malay>
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others [ah] you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist [lah]
ya I heard that (um)
<malay>dekat sana ada</malay> this thing called <malay>bumiputera</malay> where the malays are given
the malays do have more privilege than (uh) comparing compared to other races [ah] know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a (uh) national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country [lah] you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example [ah]
you and your neighbour
wanted to buy this house at <malay>taman melawati</malay> [lah] you know in #kuala lumpur# or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard [lah] I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean (uh) but then ya that's what I heard [lah] when you are chinese indian
(uh) sarawakian or #sabah# you know someone from #sabah#
you have you don't have that <malay>bumiputera</malay> rights where you can
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
should be <malay>bersyukur</malay> you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually [kan] <malay>kalau dorang gi klinik</malay> they could actually
they (uh) <malay>dorang cuma perlu bayar</malay> one <malay>ringgit</malay> [jer] [tau] one <malay>ringgit</malay> for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
a clinic I don't know you could (err) easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say [ah] but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be (err) it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being [ah] you know
they are they are going to get charged in court [eh] I know you confirm know [ah] who's that guy [ah] #najib# (uh) #najib razak# and some other
his (uh) friends getting charged at court cause
they (err) they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and <malay>kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke</malay> I mean
okay [ah] <malay>berdosa tu dah</malay> another level <malay>dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> [eh] <malay>rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu</malay> and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
<malay>kapal apa</malay> yacht [eh] I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something !wah! that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister [lah] like that you know what you think about that
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years [ah] but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and <malay>mesti dia akan dapat</malay> lawyer <malay>yang bagus-bagus</malay> [ah] and he might win the case and just (uh) go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years [ah] so
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way (uh) you know they
they (uh) give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny [lah] but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
is a joke you know is a joke you know <malay>kau kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> (uh) how how well
[ah] our ministers in singapore is acting and how (uh) well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very (uh)
I would say [ah] I don't know what to say [ah] it's very good [lah] I would say what you think about that
actually actually <malay>memang ada tapi</malay> (err)
(uh) he he's called the <malay>yang berhormat</malay> speaker you know he's the man in the centre that (uh) will call on each (uh) each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
(uh) ministry like for example financial or et cetera [lah] and but then
I really (err) you know in <malay>melayu</malay> [ah] they say <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say [eh] speaker <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [eh] speaker <malay>apa ini</malay> you know they are very chaotic you know and
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke [lah] I mean have you watch the singapore [one]
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister #shanmugam# and mister what it's called [ah] mister #vivian balakrishnan# the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
bro (uh) I don't find it weird [ah] cause <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau]
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
all of the ministers actually <malay>ada</malay> fake degree you know he actually <malay>beli</malay>
<malay>di apa</malay> a fake degree on internet or something or <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia suruh orang</malay>
<malay>pergi ambil</malay> degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something [lah] I mean <malay>memalukan</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
I mean <malay>kau dah tak</malay>
<malay>kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus</malay> and
you being a minister you will only (err) how to say (uh) not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do [lah] you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with (uh) in a higher position right they seem (uh) they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it [lah] so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most [ah] I repeat again most ministers
are recruited (uh) based on merit [lah] you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya <malay>aku aku</malay> happy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> government <malay>yang</malay> stable [ah] <malay>walaupun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ramai kata apa</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> minister <malay>ni tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>minister tu tak bagus tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> <malay>kita nya</malay> government quite stable [lah] and <malay>aku</malay> happy to see that ya
[eh] actually <malay>aku terima soalan ni banyak gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak duduk</malay> malaysia the reason being is that
[ah] the peace and financial freedom <malay>mungkin sebab masa tu</malay> I mean still (uh) <malay>sampai sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku masih kerja kat</malay> singapore [kan] and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted (uh) into the malaysian currency it's time <malay>apa</malay> times three <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>satu dolar tiga ringgit</malay> and you when you go there <malay>kau boleh</malay> spend <malay>apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa</malay> spa <malay>apa bagai</malay> and <malay>kau boleh buat apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana</malay>
and <malay>kau kerja kat sana</malay> [eh] you might not be (uh) spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia <malay>ringgit</malay> example you are earning two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in malaysia
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
!huh! so you willing to wake up in the
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and <malay>kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik</malay> bus <malay>atau naik</malay> motor <malay>pergi kerja sini</malay> and okay [lah] <malay>mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam</malay> twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
<malay>sebab</malay> ya the you know the okay example <malay>kau bangun pukul empat pagi</malay> then <malay>kau kerja sampai lima pagi</malay> and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and <malay>kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam</malay>
and you know <malay>kau</malay> barely have time for yourself [ah] you know <malay>kau rasa kau akan</malay> do that for a long term or
(um)
(uh) maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
you know try to spend two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> I mean
of course [ah] it's not easy for them I mean <malay>aku pun ada sedara kat</malay> malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in [ah] you know <malay>dalam kampung-kampung semua</malay> and (um) <malay>kalau kat</malay> singapore <malay>apa orang kata</malay> is it or gross income [lah] <malay>dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit</malay>
<malay>atau seribu lima ratus ringgit</malay> and
it's still <malay>tak cukup</malay> you know cause they are living in a <malay>dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin barang-barang murah tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>barang-barang lain macam</malay> bill <malay>makanan apa semua</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> and still <malay>tak cukup untuk dorang</malay> so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles [ah] so we cannot justify on what they are facing [ah] but [kan] in singapore itself it's very hard you know
(err) like I said [lah] having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
(uh) ya I mean I do agree [lah] on what you are what you just speak you know but (uh)
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past (uh) thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
(err) no I I don't
I mean I might sound
(err) like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships [lah]
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is <malay>haram</malay>
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong [ah]
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said [lah] I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore [lah] you know <malay>penting gila</malay> I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to <malay>tolong</malay> you to to (uh) you know to give <malay>duit</malay> I mean
it's embarrassing [ah] I mean this is not some gender inequality [lah] but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that (um) ya actually women [ah] do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
(uh) have to lead them [lah] I mean I mean this topic is very (err) subjective [lah] you know but I think in singapore women are really (um) having a good career earning more than man I would say
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains [ah] birth rate in singapore is declining [kan] <malay>orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab</malay>
ya <malay>dorang risau</malay> [kan] <malay>apa tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada tak cukup duit</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> time and
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada</malay> maid <malay>aku tak akan ambil</malay> maid <malay>untuk jaga anak aku sebab</malay>
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know <malay>besar</malay> I want to <malay>saya aku nak besar</malay> [kan] <malay>anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan</malay>
<malay>setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap</malay> they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them <malay>kasih sayang</malay> [lah] <malay>kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau</malay> you know <malay>dibesarkan dijaga oleh</malay> maid and maybe one day <malay>dorang tak kenal kau atau</malay> maybe <malay>dorang sayang</malay> maid <malay>lebih dari kau</malay>
(um)
<malay>gitu</malay> [lah] I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important [lah] singapore [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay>
<malay>kau kau bayang</malay> [kan] <malay>kau</malay> spend
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding [ah]
I mean actually
it's not even compulsory <malay>pun</malay> to have your own wedding
so <malay>yang penting</malay> I mean in our religion islam <malay>kita nikah dah cukup</malay>
<malay>tak penting pun</malay> then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend <malay>dekat kau punya rumah kau</malay> can pay <malay>lebih</malay> deposit
and stuff and (um)
ya [lah] <malay>aku rasa rumah</malay> and (uh) <malay>duit</malay> (um) savings <malay>untuk anak kau lagi penting</malay> [lah]
anyway [ah] it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye

okay (uh) <malay>kau nak</malay> start
okay (uh) my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing (uh) marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
(err) okay first
<malay>aku</malay> join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed <malay>aku gi</malay>
(uh) higher NITEC but then I found out that (uh)
I got a chance to go [ah] because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly (err) through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
<malay>ada ada minat</malay> [ah] so <malay>aku tak ada</malay> problem
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
like why why are you not (uh) interested
(mm)
(uh)
what else
okay (uh) so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay [lah]
ya
for me is (uh)
<malay>aku tengah</malay> doing #muay thai#
(uh)
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
<malay>dari silat</malay> then go squash
apparently now is #muay thai#
which I find (uh) more interesting than the others [ah] in terms of
(err) social connection and all that
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> is just
it's not my thing [ah] <malay>dikir barat</malay>
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because (uh)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> stage fright
then maybe because of that <malay>abeh dikir barat</malay> as I see is quite interesting [ah] like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
I guess now #muay thai# is going well so far
(uh) training quite intense so ya
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay>
that's the difference [ah] <malay>aku sebab</malay>
(err) that is <malay>macam</malay>
competition (uh)
not not a performance kind of competition [lah]
<malay>macam tu aku</malay> fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>sepak takraw</malay> [pe] so
that that competition <malay>macam orang tengok</malay> is normal
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
(mmhmm)
okay secondary school life okay actually because (err)
<malay>aku</malay> since young (uh) <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
not really sociable [lah] <malay>aku</malay> is a introvert ya
so
since primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> introvert so
but primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> still had this <malay>macam</malay> close friends so <malay>aku</malay> still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
still join <malay>takraw</malay> which is good and made a lot of friends there
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it [ah] and I go through it ya you go
(mm)
[ah]
so
is naughty [eh]
(uh)
okay that's the tough part <malay>sebab aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really got problem thus <malay>aku</malay> student counsellor so so <malay>aku tak boleh macam</malay> mess up [lah] so basically but the student council part also <malay>aku</malay> it wasn't
my choice [ah] because (err) sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
and then (err) <malay>dorang kira</malay> [kan]
<malay>sebab aku</malay> really from a
secondary school that is known to be
(uh) for like naughty kids [ah] and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
<malay>aku</malay> considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor [lah] in sec two ya
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>tak nak sebab aku</malay> just just <malay>malas</malay> [ah] then so (uh) the funny thing is
<malay>aku</malay> didn't even go for the interview even though I had to [lah]
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the (uh) the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
<malay>dorang dorang naik dekat</malay> (uh) assembly hall <malay>panggil aku dorang tanya</malay> (err)
why you never go for the interview and all that
okay <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say [oh] you got duty today then I'm like what
he's like [oh] ya ya you're a student counsellor [what] ya ya so I
wasn't expected [ah] but then I was just like
okay [lah] never mind I just I just take the role [lah] do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like (err)
naughty stuff that I did at least
[ah]
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya <malay>nanti ada orang hantar aku</malay>
go to sick bay <malay>nanti aku cakap</malay> stomachache and all that
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
guilty <malay>tak sangat</malay> right ya then
other then that (uh) not much [ah]
but to be honest <malay>aku rasa dorang tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dorang</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
<malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] can just go just go
ya like I think right after N level [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> first job <malay>aku</malay> was (uh) burger king which <malay>aku</malay> finds
still retail the the best (uh) job that I did [lah] as experience because okay I started
(err) in twenty seventeen which is (err) N level twenty seventeen after N levels (uh)
I join (uh) because a lot of my classmates work there also
so <malay>aku</malay> just join and then they quickly like train me
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun [lah] for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent [ah] because usually
(err) we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
(mm)
[oh]
a lot
(mm)
(mm)
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also [ah] and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
(mm)
so
after staff day <malay>takde lagi</malay>
(err) actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then (err) so compared to retail
(err) in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then (uh) imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like (err) how how can I help you then they like [oh] no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes [ah] then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king [lah]
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did (err)
photo booth (err)
kind of job
kind of [lah] because <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err) <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
(uh) business <malay>kecil</malay> so (uh)
<malay>macam</malay> referral [kan] so <malay>aku kerja</malay>
and then
the pay was quite good [ah] like three hours
I think <malay>aku dapat</malay> thirty forty
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
<malay>kau kerja</malay> is a different environment
so <malay>kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam</malay> some [ah] [a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> just at some park or some event
which was fun [ah] I got experience a lot
(uh) ya
that's all for the job experience [ah]
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute [eh]
it was terrible but (uh)
<malay>jadi</malay>
[eh] <malay>apa dah kerja</malay>
<malay>sekolah</malay>
(err) I think part of
the job experience also is why we
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about <malay>sebab aku lagi</malay> prefer hands on
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) business and all that
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup
so next year <malay>kita dua gi</malay> internship
ya
yup
shore
you quite excited [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> shore
(mm)
(uh) <malay>aku</malay>
so <malay>aku gi belayar</malay> second sem
which is exciting [ah] <malay>untuk aku sebab aku pun</malay> join <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> sailing the part
so six months sailing
exciting <malay>tapi</malay>
scary <malay>juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam</malay>
just one month of it how how can I cope [lah]
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of (uh) career
for me
<malay>sebab aku pun</malay> planning (uh)
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore (err)
<malay>aku</malay> start family and all that so ya
exciting [ah]
<malay>aku rasa kau</malay>
even though internship <malay>kau dapat</malay> shore [kan]
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> there's still a chance <malay>untuk kau</malay> sail in the future you know <malay>macam kalau kau</malay> still carry on with this career then <malay>aku rasa</malay> why not <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> diploma <malay>kau ada</malay> experience
so think is okay [lah]
<malay>takyah</malay> disappointed <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck at shore
yes <malay>sebab untuk aku</malay> (err)
<malay>aku</malay> rather sacrifice
<malay>aku punya</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> (uh)
to have a stable living [ah] for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family [lah]
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine <malay>macam</malay>
nine to five job [kan]
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
[ah] exactly <malay>jadi untuk aku macam</malay> it's worth it [lah] <malay>kau</malay> go for six months
then got free for like like three months <malay>gitu</malay> three or more then
to be really you with your family [ah] and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
(mmhmm)
yup
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>aku</malay> reach <malay>macam tiga puluh empat puluh</malay> is
you can pull down [ah] ya you can come back to shore maybe (err) continue as lecturer I you relax [ah] ya
even workshop <malay>takpe</malay> [sia] fun so
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah]
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh)
honestly following the trend [kan] <malay>aku rasa aku</malay>
we'll probably be posted to firefighting <malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku nak</malay> army
ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku ada</malay> interest in the armed forces <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> the army navy <malay>ataupun</malay> air force [ah]
so (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> firefighting <malay>pun untuk aku</malay> okay
<malay>tapi aku</malay> really <malay>tak nak</malay>
police
<malay>sebab macam bukan bukan wayang</malay>

image of them <malay>macam dorang</malay> just
<malay>datang sini</malay> screen screen <malay>macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah</malay>
(err) <malay>aku pergi</malay> seven eleven <malay>beli</malay> maggi <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang</malay> screen check check EZ-link <malay>semua aku</malay> don't find it
<malay>macam</malay> practical [lah] <malay>macam kau</malay> just <malay>kacau aku</malay> [kan] at this point [ah] so I never really had the interest for police
ya
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag <malay>aku</malay>
and it was like
[oh] what what yes
maybe <malay>dorang</malay> check <malay>rokok ke apa abeh aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just found it like like weird [lah] to be honest like until now also I still feel
(uh)
that sense of (err)
I I take it personally [ah] sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at <malay>nanti dorang tengok aku</malay>
[ah] [ah]
<malay>dorang tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang dorang panggil</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> check bag <malay>aku macam</malay> just
why [ah]
but ya that's why <malay>aku tak nak</malay> police
then <malay>kau</malay>
ya
frogmen
(mm)
<malay>sama</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> air force
<malay>dorang pun ada lain punya</malay>
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> engineering <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>ada</malay> communications <malay>punya</malay> part
I because to be pilot also <malay>susah</malay>
so
<malay>kalau dorang</malay> offer <malay>kau untuk macam</malay> (uh) continue
posted to air force [eh] <malay>kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam</malay>
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I think <malay>boleh</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> the thing is I went for the
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
(mm) so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test [ah]
[ah] <malay>ada dorang macam</malay> test <malay>kau punya</malay>
mathematics [lor] they call it arithmetics
so <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
(err) at that point of time
(err) <malay>aku betul-betul nak</malay> so
months before that [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> practice with this movie so <malay>aku aku tengok</malay> youtube video
<malay>aku</malay> take online test
unfortunately <malay>aku tak dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak bilang</malay> score
pay is
but that's the air force [ah] I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
(uh)
<malay>sebab dia ada aku rasa</malay> eight to ten different tests
so
(uh) <malay>ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah</malay>
but
honestly overall <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> did not bad
ya so <malay>tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
then hopefully just continue marine engineering [lah]
okay obviously <malay>kalau ada</malay>
the different opportunities
<malay>aku aku</malay> definitely would
ya consider
honestly <malay>kalau</malay>
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup (uh) I I don't mind any (uh) what you call that like areas [ah]
the job areas like engineering <malay>atau</malay> (uh) communications
<malay>kalau</malay> pilot [lah] who don't mind
(mm)
ya
ya
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> cockpit <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> [ah]
so
ya
<malay>aku tengok macam</malay> national days <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada dia punya</malay> jet like cool [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
but ya
what else
(mm)
what about copy [ah]
primary school life
spent there six years [eh] primary school
<malay>sama sama sama</malay> six years
which are compared to our different stages [lah]
so <malay>macam aku untuk aku</malay> primary school is when you develop your own (uh) character
ya
ya
<malay>sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku</malay> primary <malay>macam</malay> the most important
ya
(mm) yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending [ah]
[ah] the jump style
but ya primary school <malay>aku</malay> is (uh)
I think to through <malay>sepak takraw</malay> also
<malay>aku</malay>
(err) develop <malay>aku punya</malay> own personality
it's about (err) other than that
is <malay>aku</malay>
I'm a quite <malay>macam</malay> quiet person
<malay>jadi aku dalam</malay> class <malay>pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi bila aku</malay> join <malay>takraw baru aku macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>jumpa orang-orang ni semua</malay> and
I was quite good at it [ah] <malay>sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw</malay>
and then the coach was the one that <malay>macam kira</malay> recruit <malay>aku</malay>
through my brothers [ah] <malay>dia dia nampak aku dia cakap</malay> [eh] join [ah] join [ah] <malay>takraw</malay>
then then (uh) <malay>aku</malay> join and then
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
and then (err) it was funny [ah] <malay>sebab aku</malay> was
I was quite small in terms of size
(err) whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said [oh] you you sub the big one with the small one [ah]
but I I didn't mind [lah] because I know my potential and then from there (uh)
coach <malay>aku pun macam</malay> confident <malay>aku boleh main</malay>
so
by primary
I think by primary four <malay>aku</malay> managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four <malay>aku</malay> the captain at junior team and then primary five <malay>aku</malay> captain of senior team
ya so
ya ya that's why <malay>dari situ aku macam belajar macam</malay> this leadership roles
<malay>macam macam mana nak</malay> (uh)
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
<malay>sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>kalau aku tak buat</malay> homework <malay>pun dorang macam marah</malay>
so so ya
primary school was fun [lah] cause of <malay>takraw</malay> I mean
ya
#tekong#
(uh) depends
<malay>sebab kalau kalau</malay> (err)
okay usually striker is on your on the #tekong's# right
and then feeder is on the #tekong's# left
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> depending on #tekong# <malay>kalau dia</malay> left hand <malay>ke</malay> ya
(uh) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
usually striker and jumper for right leg
and then if the #tekong# is left legged then feeder <malay>nak kena belajar campak</malay>
ya
!wah! I think after almost ten years playing
(uh)
I mostly play either #tekong#
<malay>atau</malay> striker
<malay>tapi aku lagi suka</malay> striker
<malay>yang boleh bebas selang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>takraw</malay> was fun [lah] <malay>tu tu pun macam mana aku macam</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [ah] the
the thrill of competition
<malay>macam lawan</malay>
<malay>sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk</malay> nationals
and then (uh)
gain my own confidence [lah]
primary [eh]
queenstown primary <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> queenstown secondary ya
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
<malay>asal dorang bagus</malay>
[oh] <malay>sebab aku rasa</malay>
okay <malay>aku</malay> remember primary five
(err) that was like the our best performance
for the senior team [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
against (err) since the first round <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> beat every school
(uh)
the west zone okay so <malay>kita</malay> east zone (err)
(uh) school <malay>ada</malay> east north (uh) west <malay>dengan</malay> south
<malay>jadi kita dari</malay> east zone
<malay>jadi kita</malay> meet all these different schools <malay>yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita</malay> beat them [ah]
(err) using basics <malay>kita tak ada macam</malay> fancy fancy <malay>semua tapi</malay> coach <malay>kita ajar macam betul-betul</malay> master your basics
(uh) and I also think that's important [lah] because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
<malay>kita</malay> beat all these schools from
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until (uh) finals
<malay>tak itu yang</malay>
(uh)
[oh]
east zone is #junyuan# primary
ya <malay>tapi aku</malay>
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
(uh) is #qihua# #qihua# primary
and
either #qihua# or #junyuan# [ah]
but
ya #junyuan# is the east zone
champions [ah] power house
but
surprisingly national that time primary five <malay>kita</malay> beat <malay>dorang juga</malay> #junyuan# ya so <malay>kita macam kita ada</malay> this momentum [ah] which starting <malay>sampai</malay> finals <malay>kita tak kalah</malay>
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like (err) even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like (uh)
personally I felt was possible [lah] but it it came down to my
my (uh) my team
that day first
first team
(uh) <malay>menang</malay> #qihua#
second team <malay>kalah</malay>
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> champions
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
so <malay>macam</malay> every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus <malay>ada nama ni semua</malay> but never #tampines# north primary school
that was so it was
I I lost [ah] it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
(uh) if
if (err) one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
(err) we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>aku nangis rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really felt the responsibility [ah]
[eh] but ya
ya
<malay>sebab kita punya</malay> vice principal <malay>kat situ</malay>
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us [lah]
but the #tampines# north <malay>tak pernah</malay> achieve this kind of achievement
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
(uh)
it was a big accomplishment [lah]
but ya
okay
performance
wait delta league <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[oh] okay
okay
ya ya ya
think <malay>macam</malay>
is is a very big accomplishment [lah]
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay>
congratulate [lor]
<malay>abeh aku nampak</malay> that time <malay>kau</malay> post <malay>kat</malay> instagram <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> still <malay>cakap apa</malay> boys become last at least
which is demotivating [ah]
yup
yup
I think
<malay>dorang</malay> shouldn't <malay>macam</malay> just celebrate because you get at least fourth <malay>macam dorang</malay> should celebrate the change you know
[ah] that's why
no
!wah! <malay>takde</malay> love life [lah] okay <malay>tinggal macam</malay> four minutes
so
no
okay [lah] (uh) so
<malay>aku</malay> attached
ya together with someone
(uh)
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
<malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> through
(uh)
this overseas trip
<malay>dia pergi</malay> cambodia
(uh) it was a service learning trip [lah]
so
<malay>dia</malay>
okay so total sec two that time <malay>ada macam</malay>
seven class
so
she's from (err) two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
(uh)
so we went to this overseas trip then
(uh) I tried to make friends [ah] then (uh)
one of them was her
(mm)
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that [lah]
and then (uh)
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then (uh)
during sec three
(uh) we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
ya <malay>boleh</malay> click [ah] so
but that time sec three (uh) <malay>dia suka orang lain</malay>
[ah] <malay>tapi aku</malay> don't mind <malay>sebab</malay>
it was just to me like a
<malay>macam</malay>
just find her pretty you know <malay>macam</malay> I can
ya ya
so
[oh] ya <malay>aku</malay> okay then
(uh)
late sec three
<malay>yang macam dia punya</malay>
relationship <malay>dia tak</malay> work out
<malay>sebab macam</malay>
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer [ah]
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then [ah]
I think during N levels (uh) we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together [lah]
for what
to ask
(uh)
obviously I ask [ah]
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
(uh)
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me [ah] basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay (uh) I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that [ah]
but I still see a future [lah] is just
how things will work out
but ya
how about you
okay
but okay
(mmhmm)
ya

(mm)
(mm) three wishes [eh] okay firstly I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak jadi</malay> billionaire
(mm) because
<malay>jadi</malay> billionaire I feel secure
and having a lot of money
can actually solve a lot of problem <malay>macam</malay> if like in case of emergencies like
<malay>macam</malay> accident <malay>ke apa</malay> I have the money already
or like when I want to buy something that I like
I can like feel rich you know like <malay>macam jalan sana jalan sini</malay> [eh] I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
then the second one I think I want my own transport
so I want my own transport and <malay>rumah</malay>
so like what you asked right I <malay>rasa</malay> transport I <malay>nak motor ke kereta ke</malay>
[oh] best part is
I <malay>nak</malay> my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
<malay>tak payah nak tunggu</malay> flights <malay>pun</malay>
like I want to go here and there I can <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sembarang</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak</malay> flight okay <malay>aku naik aku punya</malay> private jet that kind of thing
like also [kan] <malay>macam bawa orang</malay> [lah] like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so <malay>macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam</malay> you know <malay>sekarang kita nak naik</malay> plane <malay>pun nak kena bayar</malay> for the air ticket right
but I since I already
have the private jet why not I just <malay>macam</malay> families let's go like I can
I can <malay>payung</malay> you guys for
the travel you know
transportation [ah] [eh] <malay>tapi duit belanja tak</malay>
ya then the third one
I want to have like
I want to conquer a lot of language so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> skill like that [kan]
like what's you skill [oh] I can speak a lot of language <malay>gitu macam</malay> but I want to speak like the common one [lah] <malay>macam</malay> mandarin (uh) korean it's like
common <malay>sekarang</malay> then
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
<malay>kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam</malay> nice right like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
since it's a wish right <malay>dia macam bukan macam</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
[eh] <malay>sudah aku nak letak</malay> magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need [lah] <malay>tak payah</malay>
so what about you
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
talking about family gathering
you know about <malay>yang seratus</malay> dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
or like amusement park [ah] all that <malay>ada</malay> tourism
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
you want to picnic <malay>ke nak</malay> overnight
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait [lah] for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dua ratus lebih</malay> then
you can only use your your own only [kan] <malay>abeh bayar seratus lebih gila</malay>
then
maybe we can picnic <malay>ke apa</malay> right what you said picnic then <malay>kalau kita</malay> picnic <malay>pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak</malay>
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no [lah] we put that aside first then we
<malay>macam</malay> hotel then chalet <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> staycation <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] (mm) actually not bad [ah] I think the idea is not bad <malay>abeh kita boleh</malay> barbecue <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau kita macam</malay>
chalet
chalet <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> chalet <malay>tu boleh</malay> barbecue [pe]
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food [lah]
forever food and our transportation
and then <malay>macam rumah</malay> okay <malay>rumah</malay> maybe like <malay>macam</malay> if it's like four hundred we can just
like
share among us
so it's like <malay>satu orang</malay> like <malay>berapa berapa puluh</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay> or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dengan minum</malay> okay [ah] nice then we can just cook or we can like <malay>macam</malay> chalet or what we <malay>tempat dia boleh masak</malay> [kan] so
we can just buy our groceries <malay>ke apa</malay>
then we <malay>macam simpan dalam</malay> fridge then <malay>esok tu</malay> breakfast <malay>boleh masak</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> then
I think by lunch <malay>gitu</malay> we need to
book out already [kan] so okay [lah]
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
[kan] celebration also need more money
because right <malay>takkan kita nak buat macam</malay> so called birthday party <malay>tak ada</malay> decoration <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
decoration need money also
I mean we can buy <malay>macam dekat</malay> daiso <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat</malay> neighbourhood kind of shop [kan]
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
so I'm not sure if <malay>kalau</malay> (mm) but it's a nice idea [lah] to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> both
party together like that
because we can <malay>macam</malay> save up a bit of money rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>satu</malay> birthday party <malay>lepas tu</malay> birthday party <malay>lagi habis duit</malay> then
(um) you know that a
<malay>tu</malay> confirm confirm <malay>kena bayar lagi</malay> [eh] service <malay>tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
nice but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation <malay>macam</malay> like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
we should use chalet or something rather than that because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> rules or regulations <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>kita pun nak buat macam</malay> we want to save
cause <malay>sekali tak</malay> save [eh] (uh) government <malay>pula</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] like some agency <malay>datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih</malay> [eh]
ya [lah] marina is nice [lah]
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one (uh) one place where I know
(err) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> rooftop like that [ah]
not not really rooftop <malay>dia macam</malay> not rooftop or shelter <malay>tapi macam</malay> indoor <malay>sikit</malay>
[ah] we can we can find the place around there so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tak kena</malay>
because marina west coast east coast <malay>tu semua</malay> is all
outdoor [pe]
so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> we still <malay>boleh lepak depan situ</malay>
cause that time when I went (uh) to marina
for a picnic with my friends we actually <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
<malay>abeh</malay> okay maybe <malay>kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita</malay> pack up <malay>sudah hujan lebat</malay> [kan]
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there [ah]
because it's like !alah! <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [jer] point point point
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [kan]
so
we
<malay>pergi cari</malay>
I mean we got the what is called [ah] <malay>yang besar tu</malay> parasol [eh]
parasol whatever [lah]
[ah] <malay>yang payung besar tu</malay>
we brought that also so <malay>kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ</malay> we <malay>letak</malay> so
[ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> what is it <malay>macam terpercik</malay> [eh] is it <malay>terpercik macam</malay> <malay>hujan kena</malay>
[ah] splash [lah]
like
if we <malay>macam takut hujan</malay> splash on us then we put the (uh) the <malay>payung besar</malay>
(mm) even though we under the <malay>macam</malay> cover [kan] but still [lah] we just
<malay>letak pasal takut kena juga</malay>
but still like nice because
<malay>kita tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal kita letak payung besar tu</malay>
I think I think our cousin have I think [ah] I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still (uh) that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> glamping is it <malay>dia macam</malay> wait [ah]
ya ya this one [ah]
(mm) nice we can go this kind
(mm)
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
I don't think <malay>dia orang akan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>kau nak</malay> stay <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu</malay> I don't think
they let us
(mm)
I not sure later after this we can google [ah] whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's good though but rather than <malay>macam</malay> we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
(err) take <malay>macam</malay> morning like that no we should like <malay>macam petang petang gitu</malay>
we should rent from <malay>petang petang</malay>
<malay>sampai ke malam</malay> like that so <malay>sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu</malay> ya we should rent that kind
so that <malay>macam</malay>
we confirm know we won't sleep [what]
[oh] nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle [lah]
(mm)
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate [eh]
but I I don't know <malay>kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu</malay> skate <malay>macam</malay> you don't know how to skate [kan]

no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad [ah]
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade [lah] no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
!whoa! okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before [ah] but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
(mm)
what about glove
for rental [lah]
(mm)
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want [ah]
what if people really got like
pee on it or what !eww! but ya still !ee! okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
[oh] I remember that time my [eh] my cousin our cousin our cousin said <malay>nak pergi</malay> zoo
<malay>merepek pergi</malay> zoo <malay>pergi</malay> zoo <malay>tengok binatang</malay> [jer]

both of us we don't really like animals <malay>macam</malay> !hey! <malay>kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>binatang tu</malay>
like
what's more that that you can do over there
maybe <malay>aku tak</malay> appreciate [ah] but
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
I seriously want that instead of <malay>macam pergi</malay> to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
<malay>gila</malay> I will just research about it later <malay>lepas tu nanti kita tengok</malay>
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that

since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food
they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
we are going to like have birthday celebration <malay>ni semua</malay> from
today to the next day [what] so of course <malay>kita perlu air</malay> [pe]
then we need one mineral water confirm
(mm) [ah] ya [lah] obvious

[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya because he say it's better to just buy there <malay>lepas tu pergi</malay> [pe] <malay>pasal murah</malay> [pe] <malay>belakang</malay>
<malay>kita pun</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> a bit of chips chips <malay>yang kita nak</malay> okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want [ah]
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that <malay>macam semua makan</malay> [pe]
so <malay>macam</malay> if you like <malay>macam</malay> like me
I sometimes feel <malay>macam</malay> [oh] without this I cannot [sia] I need this snack [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [eh]
[ah] ya [lah]

(mmhmm)
<malay>sayur-sayur kena</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan</malay> like that [what] <malay>macam</malay> bowl
so they will put everything inside only [what]
[ah] so I felt that it's more cleaner like that no
okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them [lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mmhmm)
okay then like that <malay>takpe kita suruh dia orang buat</malay> sandwich <malay>tapi dia macam gini</malay>
<malay>telur suruh dia orang pergi rebus</malay>
<malay>suruh kak wer atau abang rebus</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) the tuna
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl

so then after that
if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust

<malay>roti gula ke apa</malay> with the crust
which is nice [ah]
then
the crust is very easy to do what <malay>setakat</malay>
crust <malay>tu kita setakat</malay> (uh) <malay>letak</malay>
sugar and butter together inside
melted butter
so that it's easier so and then you can (uh) <malay>apa tu masuk dalam</malay> air fryer
<malay>masuk dalam</malay> air fryer <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>jadikan macam</malay> snack <malay>keras keras sikit gitu</malay>

and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
(uh) if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
they need because I think like <malay>macam</malay> whatever they like [ah] or need

how big is your face if I'm not wrong
[ah] then my friend tried it then
the I think the quality got a bit better <malay>tapi</malay> the inside you can actually put the filter
then the <malay>dia punya</malay> outer layer <malay>yang kena mulut tu</malay> is actually very silky so I <malay>tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>benda tu</malay> really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
well
know
ya <malay>tapi</malay> surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
ya
[oh] <malay>yang apa tu makan dekat</malay> #seoul# garden <malay>ke apa tu</malay> [eh]
[oh] my that one to bring like what the whole family <malay>macam</malay> reunion dinner
ya [lah] but <malay>tapi orang-orang ni pun kena</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga apa</malay> (um) the
<malay>jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>asyik lupa</malay> [jer] <malay>apa nak cakap</malay>
(um) <malay>jaga</malay>
whatever the government say <malay>kena ikut</malay> but the problem is I think <malay>kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah</malay>
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three <malay>pun masih belum ada apa-apa</malay> so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya talking about parents [kan] my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
[kan] the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
<malay>tapi</malay> the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>lagi kat</malay> got orchard then now what <malay>dia orang punya</malay> christmas period I think <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>mesti orang-orang ni mesti</malay> still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
(mm)
(mm) but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country [lah] but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go (um)
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have (um)
enough people it's about
you know <malay>banyak</malay> malaysian <malay>kerja kat sini</malay> [kan]
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless [lah]
they don't have any place to sleep over at (uh) singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that's true <malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> come up with some (um) <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> solution for the malaysian [lah] I heard that they give (um)
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
[oh] [eh] you think [ah] the people who come to singapore <malay>yang</malay> malaysia <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dia orang nak hantar barang</malay> you know like those <malay>barang-barang kita</malay> mostly <malay>datang dari</malay> malaysia [pe]
like the <malay>sayur</malay> like all those foods [lah] you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
daily [ah] (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah! [eh] you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) [eh] you remember or not <malay>yang masa</malay> the first time <malay>yang</malay> COVID nineteen <malay>ni</malay> (um) <malay>keluar</malay> at news then they were asking for people to be <malay>yang</malay> swabbers
[eh] you have any friends working for that or not <malay>sebab dia orang tak</malay> train [kan]
[ah]
!wah! but I think most of these people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> swabbers <malay>ni</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang kehilangan kerja</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(hmm)
[oh]
fifteen dollars per hour
then <malay>apa dia</malay> wear those (um) protective gear
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
expose [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
precautionary order at (mm)
!wah! <malay>leceh juga</malay> [eh] but I really pity those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> then they have like what two three <malay>anak</malay> to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what (um) home
housewife just like me
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm) I think also (um) government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know [lah] some of us <malay>ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang</malay>
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time <malay>sebab</malay>
they know better [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's true
[eh] [ah] I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
(mmhmm)
!huh!
is
we'll see
(uh huh)
a few cartons
(mm)
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
like losing their mask so <malay>sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang</malay>
(hmm)
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids <malay>tapi</malay> of course it's a added cost [lah] imagine <malay>sekarang berapa</malay> fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
<malay>kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal</malay> [tau]
<malay>satu orang hari-hari pakai satu</malay>
<malay>macam mana tu</malay> very expensive to have a surgical mask
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh] so you don't have plans [ah] for the december <malay>tak ambil</malay> leave <malay>ke</malay> maybe plan outing with your family <malay>ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
can [lah] if not you can just order in
(mm)
ya that's true
<malay>sebab iya</malay> [lah] special day [kan] <malay>mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan</malay>
but <malay>tu</malay> [lah] COVID [lah] restricted
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] for me <malay>pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang</malay> [kan] so for me my family <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> staycation
(mm) but it's quite expensive [lah] but
<malay>kesian budak-budak</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay>
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
okay <malay>selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu</malay> (um) then birthday cake then <malay>kalau saya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa tu saya sempat</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kuih raya untuk orang yang</malay> order <malay>tapi saya buat untuk</malay> small scale [jer] [lah] [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> government <malay>pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk</malay> family friends only
[eh]
<malay>kalau masak</malay> usually I will just cook (uh) whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like <malay>mi bandung</malay> (um) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> you know those normal stuff <malay>sampai tak tahu nak masak apa</malay>
<malay>betul juga</malay> (um) before this I realised that after the
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu</malay> deprive others [lah] <malay>untuk beli makan tambahan</malay> then you imagine if let's say <malay>gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya</malay>
(mm)
ya <malay>tapi mana</malay> [lah] <malay>orang ni nak ikut undang-undang</malay> so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest [lah]
(mm)
(hmm) ya
[ah] <malay>ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid</malay>
<malay>semua sekarang</malay> online
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle [lah] but lucky he is not using because he's (uh) on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
(mm)
ya that's true
(hmm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched [lah] I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
(hmm)
some of them even went to (uh) try
doing the delivery like grab <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
!wah! it's really you have to work extra hard for this (uh)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
that's long
(mm) maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying (uh) well
(mm)
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then (um) my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of (um) what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive [lah] on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
(um) having that symptom of COVID nineteen
so I think people with (uh) young kids <malay>sepatutnya</malay> maybe could just do something else [lah]
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
[eh] <malay>kita ni asyik cakap pasal</malay> government <malay>aje dah</malay> [lah] <malay>kita cakap pasal makanan pula</malay> [lah] (mm) I'm hungry already do you want to eat
(mm) #prata#
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
(mm)
[ah] okay [eh] that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
(um)
two #prata#
egg
an then
and one what else [ah] just now you recommend what
[ah] maybe I take the #prata# coin instead [lah]
is the curry very nice
[oh]
[ah] okay [lah] then I take one set of that
(uh) [eh] I saw like they have (uh) <malay>kentang</malay>
can buy one plate for me
okay what are you eating
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
[oh]
maybe I want one
#teh# #peng#
no #teh# with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
[ah]
okay [lah] then I take one mineral water
(mm) no I think that's all for now
[orh]
maybe this will take a bit more time [ah]
[eh] they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food
have you tried this
(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
okay so you ordering or I order
okay can I will just order point coin #prata#
with <malay>kentang</malay> then yourself is
#briyani# chicken fried one
and then water mineral water also for yourself mineral water
okay settled mineral water
okay so the food will arrive in
!wah! fifteen minutes okay
[oh] no they will send to us
ya so because there's table number indicate over here so I just write down our table number ya
(mm) (mm)
but by having this kind of high tech technology [eh] you see for older generation <malay>yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai</malay> app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
that's good
so (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] so how did you get to know about this like how do you volunteer is it through or because I don't see this anywhere
so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
(mmhmm)
[oh]
cause you imagine <malay>orang-orang tua lagi</malay> they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period <malay>dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh</malay> you know do the normal stuff like even going down
[lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
<malay>keluar</malay> to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage [lah] not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us [lah] <malay>orang-orang muda macam kita</malay>
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
at this point you how do I say [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use (um) handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of (um) our parents doesn't know how to use it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
though
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau</malay> (um) <malay>mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar</malay>
then
then expose <malay>diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin</malay> #inshallah# <malay>dia orang boleh buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli</malay> handphone <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>boleh mereka menggunakan dalam hari-hari yang biasa yang senang untuk</malay>
<malay>mungkin boleh guna</malay> handphone <malay>yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada</malay> handphone ace samsung ace <malay>saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua</malay> not much of (um) they don't have internet access so that's why <malay>nak kena beli</malay> line which is also an added cost
<malay>sebab mereka tak</malay> use internet [ah] data as much as us [kan] <malay>kalau kita</malay> facebook instagram <malay>baca</malay> news (uh) <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai</malay> [lah] <malay>yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin</malay>
<malay>ada cara yang lain</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>begitu</malay> indonesia <malay>dan ingat tak</malay> hong-kong <malay>baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka</malay> hong-kong <malay>balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada</malay> about other infection case
(mm)
(mm)
ya [oh] <malay>cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang</malay>
<malay>sambutan hari raya cina</malay>
<malay>saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>sedih</malay> [kan]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang</malay> in <malay>naikkan</malay> number of people to <malay>lapan</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>agak lama</malay>
<malay>saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di</malay> singapore <malay>sahaja</malay>
(mm) <malay>keluar</malay> especially #bangkok# [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul tu</malay>
<malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>saya rasa saya nak buat</malay> staycation <malay>nanti</malay>
(mm)
<malay>betul juga tapi tu</malay> [lah] staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
(mm)
<malay>betul tu</malay>
(mm)
I mean #shiok# [lor]
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau dah buka ke fasa ketiga ramai akan</malay>
<malay>lebih</malay>
<malay>selesa dan tidak risau akan</malay>
<malay>tidak risau dan</malay> also (um)
free [lah] to do whatever they want but of course within that eight person limit
(mm)
(mm)
ya
[eh]
<malay>awak nampak orang yang</malay>
<malay>pakai baju merah tu tak</malay>
<malay>tu macam</malay> safe safe <malay>apa tu saya tak nampak</malay> [lah]
[oh] <malay>dah macam</malay> police ya <malay>mereka</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
!wah! <malay>dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali</malay>
(mm) <malay>apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa</malay>
<malay>kalau mereka pusing sama tempat tapi</malay>
<malay>tak ada benda yang mereka harus</malay> report then
<malay>entah saya rasa macam</malay>
a bit of waste manpower <malay>pula</malay>
(mm)
[ah] [oh] ya <malay>baru saya ingat yang masa</malay> period <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>banyak kedai yang tutup</malay>
<malay>ada berapa</malay> video <malay>yang keluar pasal</malay> auntie uncle <malay>kat luar</malay>
(mm) then <malay>ada yang tak nak pakai</malay> mask <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nasihatkan orang</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] <malay>cuma kesian kat orang berbaju merah ni apa nama dia lagi</malay>
[oh] social distancing ambassador
(mm)
<malay>tapi yang</malay> (um) <malay>rasanya ada baju mereka tu ada yang letak</malay> <malay>mungkin</malay>

(mm) [oh]
<malay>lagi berapa minit</malay>
(mm) [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)

okay
[eh] <malay>rabak</malay> army life is the most
especially during
<malay>susah susah gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay>
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm [ah]
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] no hair <malay>botak</malay>
so ya and then like
okay [lah] they teach you a lot about like
[ah] regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
and then like there's <malay>sikit sikit kena tekan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
it's miserable [lah] everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
[ah] that's what I used to think [lah] because
when I when I became a recruit at #tekong# I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life [ah]
but honestly when
I got posted out <malay>tukar</malay> vocation
into inventory
is basically [ah]
on steroids [ah] is like <malay>lagi susah</malay>
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten [ah]
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then like <malay>buka</malay> civilian clothes
and then you are treated nicely [what]
[eh] <malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
no no
when I went to #kranji# camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
like <malay>penat</malay> [ah]
<malay>susah gila</malay>
is like
even even though you are treated fairly [ah] but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
[ah] basically you are treated like
like less than human [ah]
<malay>macam macam sampah masyarakat</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> you are treated like that bad
then
and then <malay>sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>asyik maki</malay> <malay>kena kena tekan</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>sekarang pun masih kena tekan</malay>
but not as often
ya way better [ah] but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it [ah] all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
<malay>habis boleh boleh hidup</malay> [ah]
like I managed to go through it
no [ah] <malay>ada lagi setahun</malay> [ah]
ya
ya one year pass by [what]
still <malay>lagi satu tahun</malay> [ah]
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements [ah] is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
[ah]
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I
before I the twenty four not much
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> (err) that is like much for twenty four kilometres
from the first day we move up from five
and we finish the next day at two working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
!wah! <malay>kaki dah tak boleh rasa</malay>
cannot even feel my own legs [ah]
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I (uh)
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
<malay>dia orang datang</malay>
and then I I let them (um) try on my bag [ah] my full pack
they they look like they want to die [ah] <malay>muka macam nak mati</malay> [jer]
(hmm) all [ah]
all of them
especially <malay>ibu</malay> [ah]
<malay>ibu</malay> try to <malay>angkat</malay> full pack <malay>masuk dalam</malay> back of car <malay>belakang kereta</malay>
and then like (oo) no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay [lah] that is that is twenty four K that is so big [ah]
is it everyone like <malay>betul betul nak mati</malay>
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
(um)

who who who who who does things like these two come on and then is two until like
that same day eight we didn't even stop
and like is all the way movement exercise <malay>tembak tembak tembak</malay> and then under the hot weather our exercises was was like three to four times because <malay>panas sangat</malay>

if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
<malay>benda yang tak ada lagi</malay> [ah] like we are done right
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp

the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up [lah] sorry [lah] that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
ya ya ya but youtube you can find what you want to find <malay>itu yang bagus dia</malay>
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about (err)
like photography and photoshop
so basically (err) after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
basically I want to start a new instagram <malay>punya</malay> account [ah]
(err) like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality [ah]
so it's like I get like followers [ah]
(err) it's like honestly [eh]
<malay>tak tahu asal</malay> [lah] but like instagram more revealing is is quite a thing [ah] people like really follow they find inspiration from it and
what I heard from my member as !duh!
<malay>dia</malay> got his client's straight from instagram
like they asked for mister grab even though <malay>dia tak</malay>
come forward to tell like [eh] I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu</malay> that that photoshop <malay>punya</malay> skills <malay>semua</malay> [kan] photography skill [kan] I can use to to take [ah] couple photos with my girlfriend
and <malay>pandai</malay> [kan]
ya ya
instagram is <malay>apa</malay> famous
ya is like very popular
okay and then <malay>tiba</malay> your news feed is like filled with
fitness <malay>punya benda</malay> [eh]
gym shark
(hmm) (mm)
ya [lah] yoga pants [lah] (oo) what [lah] shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
outliers <malay>macam</malay> #jujimufu#
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and !hey! bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different [ah]
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those [ah]
<malay>yang</malay> photographer <malay>pakai</malay> [lah]
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
at the subject <malay>punya nak ambil gambar tu</malay> and then when you raise your hand to block the light [kan] <malay>dia tak ada macam</malay> harsh shadows when you cover your hand <malay>nanti</malay> the the shadow is like very soft
so is like photography level <malay>punya</malay> lighting is like one on top <malay>satu dekat atas satu dekat belakang</malay>
ya so <malay>nak yang tu yang dekat belakang tu</malay> highlight so like you will highlight your back
and then like so it's look like really good [ah] that's why I also want to buy new phone
[eh] S twenty is good [ah]
[oh] no to me
technology now [kan]
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
and then need to buy memory card <malay>lagi susah leceh</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [ah]
so technology right now is like
is good [ah] how is progressing [ah]
ya ya (mm) S twenty plus [ah]
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
<malay>pasal</malay>
S twenty ultra <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone [ah] I bet you like taking photos right
(mm)
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
try to get a phone camera <malay>yang ada</malay> sixty frames per second
no just ask them any camera phones that
<malay>yang boleh</malay> record in sixty frames per second
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game [ah]
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality [lah]
ya
stuck <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
(um) (mm)
okay
okay [eh] but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want
then you should go and check review [lah] that's why I told you youtube is the best [kan] <malay>tengok</malay> full circle <malay>tengok patah balik</malay> youtube <malay>juga</malay> you know there is a story about this olympic athlete
this olympic athlete he is the

[oh] two campus [ah] no but I love my life [ah] #choa chu kang#
that that [one] you [ah] cannot blame your stupidity [lah]
because you you don't want to said it like I live at #choa chu kang# then I go back to balestier when there's a #choa chu kang# campus there ya [lah]
so I agree [lah] you agree to my statement [ah] thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
(oo) but college central is such a big school [eh]
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
it's like so lost <malay>ini sekolah ke</malay> airport [eh]
(err) my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
(um)
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then !yay! recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life [lah]
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly [ah] it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time [lah] outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something [lah]
that I can
work [lah] but
honestly I don't want to [ah] I don't want to be electrical engineer
[eh] in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold #schwarzenegger# at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
!wah!
like <malay>kerja sekarang macam</malay>
there's a lot of foreign talent
I want to be a person [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> very outs outs outstanding <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
(um) ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
(um)
P P
P P <malay>entah</malay> [lah] ya
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
not banner the advertisement <malay>dalam</malay> train
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
(mm)
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school [eh] let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
(um) ya
singapore is quite messed up [ah]
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
<malay>orang tua tua</malay>
okay from another country <malay>dengan</malay> singapore
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
you see [ah]
we progress so fast okay let's say <malay>orang tua sekarang nak pakai</malay> smartphones <malay>pun susah</malay>
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
<malay>tak tak ramai orang perasan</malay> [ah] but ya
(um)
ya ya
but okay [lah] what
I think like
(um) this this time we're so lucky to be like born in the right time <malay>pasal</malay>
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
stone aged stone aged [ah] like indonesia
ya ya ya [eh]
(mm)
<malay>pintar</malay> what word is that sorry [ah] my mother tongue is
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
<malay>pintar</malay> is <malay>pandai</malay> why not use <malay>pandai tak betul</malay> [ah]

okay [ah] I I could be right <malay>betul saya rasa ada</malay> chance <malay>betul</malay>

usually they don't allow to touch [ah] <malay>tapi kalau kita tahu</malay>

I think provided <malay>kalau takde</malay> event before that that means we can come early [tau] <malay>macam pasal</malay> slot before us is <malay>kosong</malay> (uh)
that's why I was also worried
so okay [lah] maybe <malay>macam</malay> cake <malay>semua boleh</malay> set up <malay>siang kalau kalau</malay> let's say (uh) grab time

anyway <malay>tadi yang</malay> the video I send to you was too long
[oh] that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good [lah] it it gives <malay>macam ustaz tu</malay> used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
<malay>ustaz</malay> #madarrus# he used to be in singapore now he's I think at (mmhmm) (mm) so I went for his classes last time <malay>ada cerita juga</malay> [lah] <malay>cerita dia</malay> so anyway he's quite good honestly <malay>kalau tanya saya baik</malay> so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing [ah] and then he he agree to it [lah] and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be <malay>macam</malay> have a leadership have leadership [ah] responsibility like old people <malay>dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay [ah] simply put I also understand [ah] <malay>dia cakap macam</malay> nowadays (err) parents okay <malay>macam dia cakap</malay> parents usually <malay>perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan</malay> very strict <malay>semua tak boleh</malay> ya <malay>dia macam</malay> partly part

ya [lah] western it's come from western that's why <malay>dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki</malay> they they they become matured faster <malay>pasal</malay> the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it the mother also play a role <malay>dia kata macam</malay> not to strike not strike fear [tau] <malay>macam</malay> to gain respect for <malay>macam</malay> the mother hold the status of the father <malay>macam</malay> make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father <malay>macam</malay> respect [tau] yes <malay>pasal dia cakap macam</malay>

but the Malaysian are marking up the price you see
cause they don't want [ah] they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian <malay>punya apa orang kata</malay> commission
no commission
you get what I mean or not
so maybe they are earning about two <malay>ringgit</malay> or per box or maybe four <malay>ringgit</malay> per box so Singapore also they will put that kind of price [lah] <malay>tak lebih sangat</malay> commission <malay>daripada</malay> you know Malaysian <malay>punya</malay> counterpart [lah] you know <malay>kalau tak jadi macam perbualan</malay> [kan] competition like that

she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to [ah] the person [lah] the #Aminah# but she never talked to the husband [lah]
ya she was there
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the <malay>bapa mertua</malay>
[ah] yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene <malay>dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si</malay> #Aminah Muslim# <malay>ni dekat</malay> [dah] [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu nama dia betul</malay> #Aminah Muslim# <malay>ke tak padahal dia</malay> put #Aminah Muslim# <malay>aje agaknya</malay>

she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay <malay>sekali terus dia cakap</malay> [ah] I only have
no she only have seventy dollars like what
I mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot [lah] [eh]
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
ya [lah] she scam another person [lah] babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us <malay>macam aku</malay> will go and message her and then she will say [oh] minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
but then again I don't know I until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
<malay>betul tak</malay>
(mm)
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week [ah] fourth month (uh) fourth week
(mmhmm)
[oh] in fact she (mmhmm)
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
then (uh) in fact (um) this #Aminah Muslim# right (uh) the the other the other party who was also scammed by her [ah] <malay>dia</malay> also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave #Aminah Muslim# this number the contact [lah] so
the the Thai suppliers told her that #Aminah Muslim# <malay>tak</malay> order <malay>langsung</malay>
so which sources and then #Aminah Muslim# #Aminah Muslim# <malay>ni macam cakap</malay> (uh) please show me the message <malay>macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak</malay> show <malay>kau</malay> message <malay>tu</malay> [seh]
that's why
[kan] so she is going to go babe this kind of thing [eh] once you do this kind of thing [eh] maybe you get #shiok# with it [ah] you get carried away with this scam [kan] but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay [ah] that's it your name will be viral all over the social media I'm telling you honestly
<malay>dia belum kena buku dengan ruas</malay>
<malay>dia kena buku dengan ruas</malay> [eh] <malay>yang orang suka kaki</malay> viral [eh] she will get it [ah] confirm

I already told her just give us (uh) new design you tell us [lah] cause malaysia <malay>punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa</malay>
(mm) I'm not sure <malay>tapi tengok daripada</malay> Thai Thai <malay>punya</malay> supply <malay>juga</malay> I think

(mmhmm)
(mm) baby will be sending on Thursday night is it
and then this one I want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow [lah] actually she already give [ah] later [lah] this wholesale [lah] I don't know she want or not
then Thursday she have to transfer to me
[ah] ya but #Su Muhammad#
ya like like real like that [ah]
(mmhmm) like ours [ah] like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is <malay>pendek</malay>
[kan]
(mmhmm) no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell [lah] I don't know why
just put it at #Nina Sazali# it will be a hot kicks [lah] for us <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
[ah] like like ya
[ah] yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean
so ya I think we need to invest [lah] but then again I don't see [lah] we don't need to take a lot of stocks [lah] anyway for me [lah] [eh] I don't really
[ah] like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop <malay>macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke</malay> I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead <malay>kau nak kena ada</malay> manpower
<malay>macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa</malay> you know just on and as and when
(mmhmm)
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
ya so that's why for me when I do this (um) online thingy it's actually for for <malay>aku</malay> to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
and you know to to to run the shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off <malay>punya</malay> event
but if to to be in a shop everyday I don't think I'm looking forward to that cause that's not where I see myself as unless maybe I don't know my my son and daughter grow up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) I did a flea market before
no
perfume
(mmhmm)
ya looks like it [ah]
but I think if you buy the garment <malay>kau tahu</malay> you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
(mm)
open and then clear ya it's just like our live [lah] sometimes I don't want to open this you know but then I have to open it
(mm)
ya
ya the man ya
ya but ya I think but once in a while maybe once a month can do this flea market stuff but not like every week you have to do this flea market I'm not into that looking forward to any like you know every week I have to go to a flea market cause for me is much more on you know home-based I don't know I mean some people have big dreams [lah] but I I don't see I don't know how about you
ya I mean I I love to go to a flea market but but then again like you said setup and cleaning up and then manpower I mean you have to have manpower for it [lah]
which is (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya about nine
ya you know like the event in the make up you know like the what last time they always have this exhibition all [lah] what is it called
what is it [ah] expo expo all these [eh] bazaar is it a mini bazaar [oh] my god I I I I've been seeing I did a bazaar before [ah] last time I was working in the bazaar ramadan
making bubble tea [eh]
when I was a teenager I still remember that that bubble tea was a new craze you know that time I was in
sec three or sec four [lah] that time
and it's very tiring [seh] it's very tiring [oh] my gosh
(mmhmm) boss
(mm) some more we will have to think of the money
ya true
so
(mm)
I think I think
ya rather than you have some live you see they have to go to the shop as well cause they have a shop so they do it in a shop so like I said I'm not looking I don't know maybe in ten years time maybe I don't know like what I'm doing right now is just for a supplementary to my income
<malay>berapa</malay> [dah] <malay>lima puluh ke kau</malay> [eh] fifty [eh] okay [oh] ya you're forty now [ah]
[eh] age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even #Saadiah# [ah] she said [lah] next year <malay>kita buka kedai</malay> [lah] I was like seriously
<malay>dia nak</malay> boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big [ah] you know like inside my heart [oh] no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
[ah] she wants to quit her job yes
but then again I I think that she is like what you know <malay>semangat lima minit</malay> kind of person
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
(mm)
she offered she offered but I don't want
knowing her you see how different [ah] from that live with my live
(mmhmm)
anyway if I do for her it's I never come out the money [what]
right so she is the boss
babe the friend staying condo [lah] the friend shipped [ah] buy the stocks [lah] cause when I heard the live [ah] she said self-collect at #Woodlands# not at #Tampines#
so it's from the house
[oh] somebody is crying is it
[oh] <malay>kucing</malay> [ah] [oh] okay cat fighting ya
what to do [eh] cat fighting nature nature
okay so like like I said [lah] so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like <malay>berkinja-kinja</malay> you know at the live she used my words like <malay>wanita lindungan kaabah</malay> all these you know and then but with me !huh! <malay>pening</malay> [lah] <malay>pening</malay> [lah] <malay>pening</malay> [lah] over here <malay>pening</malay> over there <malay>pening</malay>
ya
what
the other one is the lady's <malay>punya</malay> [ah] (um) <malay>dia punya apa ni</malay> [ah] <malay>anak</malay> (mmhmm)
so okay [lah] I hope this conversation doesn't leak out [ah]
no no but I'm I'm going to I'm going to give her back [lah] in her own time [ah] I don't want to sell for her anymore [lah] but I don't want to make it so obvious [lah] you know
[ah] ya [ah] but I don't want to make it actually in fact I don't after the incident
ya <malay>tak ada hati</malay> ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class [meh] cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me [lah] never mind [lah] I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know <malay>memang</malay> we never come out with a lot of money [lah] but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can [lah] (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)

ya it takes two hands [ah] ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite <malay>macam</malay> understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good [lah] you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of

what should I do
she will be in primary <malay>darjah dia baru darjah</malay> no <malay>darjah empat</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>darjah</malay> it's primary four ya
that's the thing and then I also was thinking of my workplace I mean this is quite near to my house my new house as well [lah] you know I have to take about four stops away from my new
ya but then again I also don't know when I'm moving right
get what I mean so I will start start off this next year if I haven't move out I will start off at this place
ya so I mean if you already start off at this place why why would you want to move out of to another place right I see first [ah] but then again it's quite near to my house as well it's only like three or four stops away
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but then I have to wake up early (mm) I have to wait for her
[kan] so I don't I don't know [ah] it's very stress [ah] <malay>fikir</malay> [kan] <malay>ni semua</malay>
true so that's why [lah] I'm thinking I don't know [ah] what should I do
I mean
it is it is a must for me to change the school to #Tampines# cause it's better for her <malay>macam dia boleh</malay> rest after school <malay>cepat balik betul tak</malay> the #Tampines# north is very near to my house
ya very very near
so <malay>kalau dia</malay> [dah] <malay>balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik</malay> you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four <malay>abang</malay> will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
(mm) (mm) (mm) so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing <malay>abang</malay> up <malay>abang</malay> doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill [lah] <malay>mak</malay> I can do it
I hope so
ya he's very independent

[ah] no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had (um) indonesian <malay>punya</malay> maid so sometimes ya
ya
(uh) ya ya ya so actually (um) like last time my maid <malay>selalu</malay> (um) talk to me in in <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia <malay>macam</malay> I know how ya how to speak ya (hmm)
sorry
(um) actually it just <malay>baru baru</malay> start so <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
I see I see ya
(hmm)
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy <malay>macam</malay> what's the what's the point what's the point <malay>kalau kau pergi kerja</malay> everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] <malay>sama sama</malay> ya is is I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite common <malay>gitu</malay> to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
<malay>dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun</malay> in
you <malay>kerja</malay> [oh] so <malay>baru</malay> graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
<malay>dari dari</malay>
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
I see I see
[oh] drama side drama side <malay>macam buat apa</malay> like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>untuk dia punya budak-budak</malay> that kind of thing [lah]
I see I see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company <malay>macam</malay> allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> (mm) okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> like some some of us <malay>yang baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that <malay>macam</malay> when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like <malay>macam</malay> is it a mismatch of expectations <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss <malay>macam</malay> I recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then <malay>kalau</malay> when you're better than you can always <malay>balik</malay> go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I work for <malay>dua tahun</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) I tried <malay>dua</malay> company <malay>tapi macam</malay> (uh) at the same time it felt different <malay>tapi macam</malay> same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> if it's the industry <malay>punya</malay> issue or <malay>kalau</malay> I need to change industry <malay>atau</malay> change company ya <malay>macam</malay> that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to <malay>macam</malay> take a break and then (um) from there I explored different different <malay>punya</malay> industry and then (um) at the same time I <malay>kerja</malay> part time then (um) <malay>macam</malay> trying to at the same time I explore [lah] whether I feel <malay>nak</malay> stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right <malay>macam</malay> you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now <malay>macam</malay> it's COVID <malay>punya</malay> period then then <malay>nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah</malay> then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than <malay>macam</malay> nothing right
(mm)
ya ya ya I think to be honest <malay>macam</malay> singaporean man a bit cautious or like became <malay>fikir banyak sangat</malay> of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then <malay>kalau</malay> doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so <malay>macam</malay> just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so <malay>macam</malay> at every ya every <malay>setiap pagi</malay> I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for <malay>macam tiga jam</malay> [jer] then (um) <malay>ada</malay> assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things I guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's <malay>enam enam bulan</malay> then ya at the same time they are <malay>macam</malay> giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya <malay>tapi</malay> those (hmm) <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>untuk</malay> mid career adults [lah] <malay>macam</malay> those that <malay>ada</malay> work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] I guess ya
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tak payah</malay> because everyday <malay>macam</malay> is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay I see I see I see <malay>sebab dia</malay> what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> overload of things to to do right do you feel
<malay>tapi</malay> what about the your your other work <malay>punya</malay> colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
I see I see
I see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] <malay>macam susah</malay> so
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so I started taking (um) (um) I started joining this financial advisory <malay>punya</malay> company then <malay>dia orang</malay> give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] <malay>macam</malay> how to how to like you know prospect for clients <malay>macam</malay> how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I <malay>rasa</malay> sales <malay>punya</malay> skill is quite important <malay>macam</malay> in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or <malay>kalau</malay> be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn <malay>macam susah</malay> to <malay>macam</malay> convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) I <malay>macam baru</malay> start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that <malay>macam</malay> I think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you <malay>macam</malay> want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess <malay>tapi macam</malay> I haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to <malay>macam</malay> earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense <malay>macam</malay> or even though <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy <malay>macam</malay> ya like I don't <malay>bangun tak rasa macam</malay> stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work <malay>macam</malay> you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this <malay>macam</malay> how I felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you <malay>balik rumah macam tak ada</malay> mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya I think it's common like <malay>macam</malay> I spoke to my <malay>kawan</malay> my friends <malay>dia orang pun macam rasa</malay> the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try <malay>macam</malay> try company company <malay>lain tak</malay> like because <malay>ini</malay> your first job [kan]
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether <malay>macam</malay> is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
I see I see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>dia boleh</malay> pay for <malay>dia punya</malay> own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really <malay>macam</malay> it's I think <malay>sekarang</malay> we're in a very difficult <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>pasal</malay> there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my <malay>mak</malay> and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though I'm already twenty five <malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five <malay>dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak</malay> you know that kind of thing but they but they don't <malay>macam</malay> push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think [ah] <malay>macam syukur</malay> [lah] like I feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so I'm thankful for that ya I'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] I know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) I see ya I think <malay>macam</malay> same my family <malay>macam</malay> not very affectionate also when growing up what <malay>macam</malay> don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya I think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you <malay>ada</malay> connections with like theatre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I know what you mean actually I'm also seeing someone then I also feel a bit down like but even though even though like I don't really talk about it like ya I do worry about like what what I'm whether I'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so I think is understandable what you feel I've totally get it ya
ya I get it
(mm)
(um) actually <malay>macam</malay> I just told him I am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like <malay>macam tengah belajar</malay> new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so <malay>macam</malay> I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything [lah] like I can pay for my own things like I <malay>ada</malay> savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like <malay>ada ada</malay> like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> it you make you look forward to <malay>nak pergi kerja</malay> you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]

I don't know I think <malay>macam</malay> I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of <malay>macam</malay> thought into it it's not <malay>macam</malay> a fleeting decision like I was really <malay>macam</malay> very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my <malay>punya</malay> bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like I was facing a difficult <malay>punya</malay> client <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>hentam</malay> on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time <malay>macam</malay> as in like I said [lah] because I had <malay>macam</malay> savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] <malay>macam sekarang sekarang</malay> is probation period is it
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have so actually <malay>macam</malay> you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya
[oh] ya
you have do you have siblings like you <malay>ada kakak</malay> or <malay>adik</malay> like
[oh] only one <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
!huh! sorry [oh] see I see okay ya I'm also not <malay>tak tak</malay> not close to my siblings my elder siblings too <malay>pasal dia orang dah</malay> marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common [lah]
(hmm)
so (um) I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like <malay>macam</malay> sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
ya
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that (hmm) that is so important <malay>macam</malay> not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to <malay>macam</malay> cafe where <malay>dia punya</malay> server is so friendly like <malay>dia</malay> bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending <malay>dia punya</malay> food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
but ya hopefully you find something that makes you happy that's quite as in even if it's not happy doesn't make you unhappy ya
or maybe like if you do need help to like have you consulted like polyclinic to get referral to doctors
[oh] you have already that's good because I have friends who did the same
no what's that
(hmm)
tapi dia punya</malay> fees what about the fees
[oh] that's good
okay have you tried the polyclinic route cause a lot of people do that way I don't know whether it's cheaper

our mothers like like I told my mum

at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
<malay>kita</malay> we just like
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other I I'm trying to recall the story
okay <malay>kita tengok</malay> each other (uh) let's just sleep
together
so we actually brought the entire (uh) we moved the entire bed (uh) all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
ya in in like (uh) instinct [lah] I would <malay>kita punya</malay> like our instinct were like were we were like telling each other
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
okay <malay>kita</malay> we slept together so cause of the bathtub right
we thought of like (uh) let let's go get bath bombs
so everyone were very excited (uh) to <malay>mandi</malay>
(uh)
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
<malay>sebab tandas tu besar</malay>
<malay>tandas tu besar</malay>
no
<malay>tak</malay> the <malay>tandas besar</malay>
okay the <malay>tandas</malay> is the size of a <malay>punya</malay> flat (uh) the room the room size the ya this room size
yes so the <malay>pintu</malay> then after that
(um)
after that is the bathtub
(um) the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
<malay>kita mandi kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>orang tengah tengok</malay>
<malay>tak kita semua</malay> [ah] <malay>bilik masing-masing</malay> [pe]
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh)
okay <malay>kau sepuluh minit kau sepuluh minit aku sepuluh minit</malay>
<malay>faham tak</malay> so
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and (uh) my grandma
so so we shared [lah] (uh) you know (uh) <malay>kita macam</malay> (uh) <malay>takut macam kita masuk kita masuk bilik kita rasa lain</malay>
so my so my grandma my my <malay>nenek</malay> asked [lah] (uh) <malay>apa yang lainnya</malay>
my my my <malay>kakak</malay> my <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
yes
so do you know so so you you know when people say the <malay>bilik berabuk</malay>
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
so that's what been saying [a'ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
so okay <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay> and then
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
so <malay>kita</malay> so <malay>kita semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>diam</malay> [tau] <malay>kita semua tak</malay>
(um)
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak</malay> share okay we didn't share with each other what happened so on the other side they also told they they told (uh) the same thing to <malay>dia punya</malay> to their to their family [lah]
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say (um)
[eh] <malay>korang tak perasan ke bilik dia berabuk</malay>
ya
we only we only shared with okay technically we didn't share with each other we bring we we went back we we tell each other <malay>kita</malay> our own family members and then after that when my parents when my when my when my mum called her sister
when my mum called her sister then
they were like like <malay>makcik makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh#
(mmhmm)
[eh] <malay>budak budak tu pun cakap</malay>
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
we didn't know [ah] my then my mum when when we came back from work [ah] then <malay>baru</malay> [ah]
my <malay>mak</malay> my mum said [ah] [eh] do you know that [ah] you know (um) they experienced (uh) whatever you all experience you know
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
let's meet let's meet at (um) let's meet at my <malay>umi</malay> house
so <malay>dekat rumah</malay> my <malay>umi</malay>
<malay>baru kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kongsi</malay> stories <malay>kongsi cerita</malay>
ya so and then they say okay first that's why that's why my cousin was so (um) <malay>macam</malay> very persistent (uh) to get
(uh) another bed
so that the <malay>kakak</malay> so that the sister can sleep no nobody is separated from each other
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
it's a big mirror with (um) a shelf and actually that shelf is <malay>berabuk</malay> already but I didn't but for me <malay>berabuk</malay> is
(um)
for me <malay>berabuk</malay>
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall [one] the room was dusty [lah]
<malay>bilik dia lain</malay>
<malay>sebab kita sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
<malay>sampai siang</malay>
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
(um) in our heart [lah] we're like
<malay>tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>tingkat</malay>
<malay>tapi tapi</malay>
<malay>kita semua diam</malay>
<malay>kita kita semua diam sebab kita semua dah ngantuk</malay>
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita ikut</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>tapi</malay> in (uh) <malay>dalam hati</malay> it's actually <malay>kita semua macam</malay>
(uh) this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause (uh) it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed [ah]
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins (uh) she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins [ah]
<malay>punya kawan tanya dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> (uh) best
best <malay>tak</malay>
so my cousin said (uh)
best [lah]
(uh) it was fun
but we had (uh)
we had experiences
(uh) in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
<malay>dia tanya</malay>
hotel <malay>mana</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> you <malay>tinggal</malay>
[oh] (uh) [oh] <malay>kita tinggal</malay> hotel <malay>ni ni ni</malay> [ah]
[oh]
you <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> hotel [ah]
(um) <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>saya punya bapa</malay> (uh) <malay>sudah</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay>
<malay>ahli yang lain</malay> so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do [ah] they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>panggil</malay> (uh) <malay>ustaz</malay> buddha [ah] <malay>ahli-ahli ugama</malay>
<malay>untuk sembahyang</malay> [kan] the <malay>bilik</malay> to (uh) to <malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] the hotel the blessed bless the hotel
yes
so they did that (um)
so so the moment she know what that she (uh) quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google [lah]
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
(uh)
<malay>ni kali kedua</malay>
the first time
was with my family
but that [one] we actually (uh) my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room [ah] during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just (uh) king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the (uh)
front room [lah]
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
speaking of <malay>orang kaya</malay>
<malay>kita tak ada jiran</malay>
[ah] okay <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>setahu kita kita takde jiran</malay>
<malay>tapi kita selalu dengar macam</malay> (uh) <malay>macam kita dengar benda</malay> [lah]
<malay>kita boleh dengar benda</malay>
<malay>tapi kita tahu kita takde jiran</malay>
okay <malay>bilik kita bilik hujung</malay>
corner corner
okay the the floor
okay the okay <malay>bilik</malay> the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how <malay>orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu</malay>
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
<malay>leceh</malay> [seh]
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
<malay>kita tak kesah sebab kita malas nak</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>nak angkut barang-barang kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> okay <malay>kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kat depan</malay>
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
we still when when we we <malay>kita</malay> share when <malay>kita kongsi</malay> story (uh) <malay>cerita ni dengan</malay> (um)
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
the shopping mall is just down <malay>bawah</malay>
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]

I not sure but yes [ah] <malay>aku aku tak minat tapi</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> the <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> any course that I can put [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> along the way #alhamdulillah#
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay>
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay> marine engineering <malay>nya</malay> module
and I'm doing quite okay in it [lah]
(mm)
doing okay
so <malay>kau apa sekarang</malay> [lah] like what are you doing in school what are your activities
[oh]
<malay>aku</malay> in <malay>dikir barat</malay> [ah] as you know
I I always tried to pull you in <malay>dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk</malay> so
now I really want to know the reason why <malay>kau tak nak masuk dikir barat</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
#muay thai# <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bukannya</malay> #muay thai# <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> stage fright <malay>ke</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> spectators <malay>tengok</malay>
is like to win [lah] is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself [lah]
right <malay>faham faham</malay> I understand
so actually our poly life quite stale
because <malay>sekarang pun</malay> COVID
then like <malay>kita lima hari</malay> five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert [ah]
studying
<malay>sama juga</malay> I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in secondary school especially in my
in my <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) younger days [ah] my sec one sec two <malay>menengah satu menengah dua</malay> that kind so I
<malay>banyak masalah dulu dengan cikgu</malay>
every month <malay>bapa kena</malay> call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise <malay>yang</malay>
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
so that's when <malay>aku sedar</malay> [lah] that I have to bulk up <malay>kalau tak memang aku takleh</malay> survive N or O levels
that's when N levels I did well
I did get twelve points [ah] <malay>takleh</malay>
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong [ah]
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject <malay>yang aku ambil</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> end up in poly now
ya what is the most <malay>macam</malay>
what is the most naughty thing <malay>yang kau pernah buat</malay> secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most <malay>yang paling</malay>
[oh]
<malay>paling mahal</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
so <malay>kira</malay> [kan] self self nominate <malay>kau terus masuk</malay>
actually talking about <malay>yang</malay> student student council student leader and
<malay>dulu</malay> like what you said I was very naughty <malay>nakal gila</malay>
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
<malay>macam apa aku buat semua aku kena</malay> tone down <malay>pasal aku</malay> chairperson of the class and my school <malay>dorang ada selalu macam</malay> best chairperson
best leader best <malay>apa</malay> so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last [lah] basically <malay>macam</malay> in the rankings so <malay>macam</malay> sec three <malay>tu memang</malay> quite tough [lah] is like I'm still naughty
but end up <malay>nanti cikgu jalan</malay>
<malay>dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong</malay> [ah] I go <malay>angkat</malay>
teacher you need help [ah] then <malay>aku angkat aku angkat</malay> [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> staffroom
so <malay>kira</malay> like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so <malay>aku</malay> just suck it up [lah]
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head [lah] I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
and my teachers in sports leaders <malay>suka aku</malay>
<malay>pasal aku</malay> not the quiet type
but students leader <malay>punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku</malay> naughty <malay>sangat</malay> so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school [lah] <malay>tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada</malay> different opinion about the same person
ya
that's that's being naughty [lah] <malay>dekat sekolah</malay>
ya
[oh] <malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>tu bikin kau paling</malay> guilty [ah] [kan]
guilty <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>jadi cikgu tertipu</malay> [kan]
they love it too much [lah] they think you can they can
you can hold on to you [ah]
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
so <malay>macam dorang dah</malay> bless [ah]
so <malay>lepas</malay> O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time <malay>ke</malay>
burger king
(mm)
I basically after N levels
<malay>aku kerja yang kau tahu</malay> volunteer volunteer <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>yang nampak dekat</malay> (uh) fast jobs <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> [oh] you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance [ah] <malay>kira</malay> that time too is big money for me know so <malay>kadang-kadang kalau ada</malay> shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
that was my basically <malay>aku nya</malay> work for my whole N level till when I go sec five [ah]
so <malay>aku akan kerja</malay> all the way
then basically nothing much [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan</malay> with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
I work there and it was a good experience [lah] it was a good two months
experience <malay>aku pernah</malay> [tau] <malay>sekali kerja</malay>
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
<malay>tiga hari</malay> [jer] off day <malay>aku nya gaji</malay> at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and <malay>satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> minus
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
so if anybody interested join staff <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] ya so
irony but I do have some problems [lah] I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually <malay>orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama</malay> age
don't have the same (uh) mentality as us
the same <malay>pemikiran</malay> [lah] basically so <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tahan</malay> for two months then <malay>aku</malay> just took adapt <malay>aku</malay> just try to adapt to the situation [lah] <malay>yang aku aku</malay> was in
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly <malay>baik gila</malay>
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities <malay>semua dorang kena beli</malay> then they have to keep at home
so it's a tough time [ah] for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
!wah! salute [ah] <malay>dorang</malay>
ya
after staff day nope
I don't <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>tak kerja</malay>
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's [what]
the group [mah]
(mm)
okay that was that was fast
like photographer [ah]
<malay>tolong orang ambil gambar</malay>
[oh]
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
[oh] is not always the <malay>sama</malay> part [lah]
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
as in <malay>aku prefer</malay> [tau] honestly <malay>aku</malay> would prefer a busy
a busy working environment <malay>pasal</malay> at least <malay>aku ada benda</malay> [tau] <malay>nak buat</malay> like something to do <malay>kalau</malay> they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
my opinion [ah]
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
<malay>macam benda ni semua</malay> I can see <malay>cikgu kita</malay> are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be <malay>macam</malay> very independent because in the future <malay>semua benda-benda</malay> engineering <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>dorang dah ajar</malay>
you apply yourself
they won't <malay>hari-hari tengok kau buat</malay>
they would expect you to know how to do and all
that's why <malay>macam</malay> I feel engineering early brush you [lah] and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop [ah]
<malay>macam betul-betul</malay> flop then <malay>susah</malay> once you know once <malay>dah jatuh</malay> in poly <malay>susah nak naik balik</malay>
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
<malay>aku masuk</malay> shore which is first first semester so right after this semester <malay>aku</malay> probably has a month's break then after that <malay>aku dah kena masuk</malay> intern [lah]
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
by <malay>dia punya</malay> sailing
<malay>aku nak belayar</malay> basically I just want to go
explore countries <malay>negara semua negara</malay> england <malay>semua</malay> whatever [lah]
(uh) <malay>yang ada</malay> ports <malay>semua</malay> [kan] saudi arabia <malay>ke</malay> whatever
so <malay>aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> sailing results must be very strong
because it's the top few [ah] from what I know [lah] from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
so <malay>aku</malay> legit work very hard
<malay>untuk aku</malay> year one year two <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>rezeki tak ada aku tak dapat</malay>
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
<malay>aku punya</malay> type is <malay>aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir</malay> [ah]
so I just follow the flow
so at the end of the day <malay>aku</malay> don't mind shore <malay>kalau dapat</malay> keppel okay [lor]
<malay>kira</malay> very good [orh] keppel
then ya [lah] I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay>
but ya [lah] you so you are willing [lah] <malay>kau kira</malay> willing <malay>untuk</malay> sail every year six months
to make it as your career
time <malay>kau balik pun dah penat</malay>
(mm)
correct agree
so your ultimate goal is to get <malay>macam</malay>
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore [lah]
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> you are not away from your family too long
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down [lah]
surveyor <malay>macam benda</malay> relax [ah]
ya
yup but honestly
okay [ah] during during circuit breaker and all we all <malay>semua</malay> stuck <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
<malay>pelik</malay> but yes <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> found a love from
karma medic [lah] <malay>nama</malay> youtube channel
and <malay>aku suka</malay> biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class <malay>duduk belakang dengar</malay>
that's how much I love bio last time
but ya the love come back and I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya so talking about uni <malay>kita belum lagi lepas</malay>
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
<malay>wayang</malay> [ah]
annoying
<malay>kacau-kacau</malay>
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
(mm)
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun [lah] I mean
I I watch a lot of [ah] boys to men [ah] so I find the navy part the best [ah]
so [ah] the frogmen one <malay>tu yang paling gerek</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku nak masuk</malay> navy <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku tahu tak</malay> probably <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [lah] <malay>masuk</malay> navy [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> chance will be slim
but yes [ah] so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>tak aku nak</malay> try my best to go police
<malay>kalau</malay> police <malay>pun</malay>
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
<malay>aku kena</malay> train <malay>banyak</malay> so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
got highly likely [lah]
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to [ah]
special operations command
<malay>kalau tak pun</malay> I don't mind
[eh] <malay>pula</malay> I don't mind civil defense
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and (uh)
[ah] firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life [hor]
<malay>tu pun pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai</malay>
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first [leh]
my father never go so <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always <malay>kena hijau</malay> from the trend [lah] that's what they say [lah] but no <malay>hijau</malay> for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring [lah] my opinion <malay>macam gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] ya okay [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay>
will definitely be will definitely glow up [lah] after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
<malay>tapi kalau aku dapat</malay> air force who wouldn't take it
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
!chey! !wah! <malay>pandai</malay> [seh] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] intelligence
I don't think got chance [ah]
intelligence
talk [eh]
four hours
quick maths [ah]
okay
<malay>susah dok</malay>
it was okay
what was your score though they never tell you <malay>tak bilang</malay>
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult <malay>ke apa</malay>
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma [lah] there's normally
consider
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ke dah dah minat nak</malay> sign on
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
<malay>kena berapa bagus</malay> !wow!
<malay>ada</malay> size <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
okay
it's kinda cool though
(mm)
primary school
<malay>sekarang berapa</malay> years
<malay>masih</malay> [eh] <malay>masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun</malay> [jer] primary school
(mm)
is like our one of our longest [ah]
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be [ah]
<malay>bila</malay> primary school [kan] <malay>nanti</malay>
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
<malay>nanti kita tengok</malay> movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there <malay>kita semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> basically know the type of person you want to be like (err) like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>punya</malay> movie show [kan] was [ah]
wrestling
so I really look up to them [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I didn't realise [tau] <malay>yang itu semua watak</malay>
as in <malay>tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua</malay> just <malay>rekaan</malay> [tau] I didn't know
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay let's say <malay>macam dulu</malay> undertaker <malay>betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia jahat betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak nak nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>nak kasi orang sakit</malay>
so I like their character [ah]
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like <malay>macam</malay> undertaker
<malay>buat mata dia yang</malay> roll eyes back
so <malay>kira macam</malay> last time primary school was one of the best times because
<malay>kita</malay> explore [ah]
<malay>kita</malay> explore <malay>banyak benda</malay>
<malay>satu hari kita</malay> undertaker the next day we john cena the next day #yuka civi#
ya that was that was fun days [ah]
ya in primary school also <malay>dulu kita suka buat banyak</malay> parkour
do you do parkour in school it's like normal [lah] primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
so you have been leading all the way [lah] you have been leading the lines [lah]
discipline
(mm)
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
#tekong# the left side is striker
[oh]
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
striker <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay> like horse kick right
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
<malay>sepak takraw</malay>
they were national team player [ah] after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
have you ever win the finals <malay>pernah menang</malay>
<malay>selalu kalah dengan siapa</malay>
who's your bogey team [ah] <malay>macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti</malay>
<malay>kalah punya</malay>
#junyuan# #tampines# located around #tampines# [kan]
#junyuan#
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus [lah]
pressure [lah]
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
<malay>sedih</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
you never go this far [lah]
!woo! amazing story
for me <malay>kalau bab-bab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>atau</malay> activity [kan]
I don't really have much luck [lah]
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
I was goalkeeper you know you know when <malay>kau penjaga gawang</malay> in primary school
you will always be blamed
if the goals you concede so we basically second round <malay>kita dah keluar</malay> everytime
<malay>kita masuk</malay> south zone <malay>kita keluar kita</malay> group stages
then secondary school I was in so <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>ada banyak</malay>
[lah] <malay>yang joget-joget sambil</malay> marching
to our highest position that we ever got
in #gan eng seng# secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us (err) (err) the
the the drop dead centre [lah]
then when I go so basically no luck [lah] I go delta league also I play under my school name
(uh) and that [one] second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
[ah] make the police create the league <malay>untuk macam orang-orang tak</malay>
<malay>buat buat kerja nakal macam</malay>
<malay>dadah</malay>
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
<malay>untuk</malay> all the <malay>budak melayu</malay> not only <malay>budak melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>budak melayu budak cina</malay> there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
for a prize
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors <malay>semua masuk</malay>
<malay>tu pun</malay> second round <malay>kita</malay> out
then when I goes poly
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay>
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay> and my first ever performance
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me [lah] it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
so of course after the performance <malay>aku nangis</malay> [siol]
<malay>aku nangis</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really my heart was pouring [ah]
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
so that that was when my mood for <malay>dikir</malay> honestly
like
go down [ah]
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
<malay>aku kena aku kena</malay> step in to change
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
(um) this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
for <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they they appointed me as captain and
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents <malay>ragu-ragu</malay> [ah]
my parents will think [eh] <malay>macam mana aku nya anak nya</malay> results
<malay>sekolah pelajaran akan</malay> jeopardise <malay>ke tak</malay>
that kind of thing so <malay>aku pun macam</malay> second guess [ah] <malay>aku</malay> second guess but I love <malay>dikir barat</malay> so much
and I look at how rich our history
in <malay>dikir barat</malay> twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like <malay>macam nama</malay> engraved <malay>dekat dekat kau nya</malay> trophy I also never had the recognition of
<malay>pemenang dikir barat</malay> singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
it's a heavy responsibility <malay>tapi</malay> we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
<malay>macam</malay> teaching
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
your <malay>kawan takkan</malay> [eh] coach <malay>pasal</malay> they coach <malay>kau marah dia tapi kau</malay> as a <malay>kawan kau</malay> still <malay>tolong</malay> that kind of thing
ya so I guess
we have our ups and downs <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
<malay>kau</malay> cannot
you
you will not succeed
<malay>kalau kau</malay> always feel that you are at the bottom
you know
at least something know
<malay>dah kita dah</malay> improve at least be happy about it <malay>jangan cakap</malay> !yay! <malay>tak</malay> last
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey [lah] how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
that that that <malay>pada aku tu yang paling penting</malay> [ah] <malay>dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> inner change
because to see change you also have to change
you can't keep thinking of [eh] <malay>kita dulu</malay> last
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya [lah] it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further [lah]
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life

then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like

I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept

okay something not really random but
interesting that happen yesterday
(err) I booked for ten thirty class
for F forty five at #novena# shout out to F forty five #novena#
K (err) <malay>abeh lepas tu aku</malay> we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend <malay>pergi tanya</malay> the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>semua aku punya badan tengah</malay> ya back to back it's really very tiring
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> word
(err) cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay I think maybe I should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest <malay>macam</malay> I think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody <malay>macam</malay> just doing their own <malay>apa ni</malay> doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then <malay>dia kata</malay>
come on guys let's do it <malay>gitu aku macam tak</malay> it's it's more of like an australian accent
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not
ya
no [lah] but I think it's part of
I don't know but but at at least quite nice but when when when I was doing it [kan] the like <malay>dia cakap</malay> come on guys let's do it or something <malay>macam</malay> like along the lines and then she's like hydrate yourself and then <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay I I'm gonna keep pushing
and then I somehow just maybe it's just in my mind [lah] <malay>macam</malay> it's a motivation
<malay>motivasi</malay>
<malay>motivasi</malay> (err) no [lah] <malay>kau tahu yang kawan aku</malay> korean tu
korean korean ya [kan] <malay>aku</malay> post <malay>gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>yang aku</malay> post <malay>gambar aku belajar</malay> not sorry
<malay>dia dulu</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
okay cannot say anything else because it's a for him again <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
but [ah] ya
<malay>apa</malay>
no [lah] he just he just want to go there for fun because also trial lesson is forty nine dollars [kan] so they can do for two weeks [ah] it's just <malay>macam</malay> trial so to see whether this place suits you <malay>kalau tak</malay> you have to subscribe for like one month <malay>ke</malay> per class per class for #novena# is
twenty five dollars
(err) per month which is like unlimited bookings is two hundred sixty
ya so for them for people to try out ya for people to try that why
he let like the forty nine dollars [lah] so but forty nine dollars you can use (err) train in different different places
<malay>macam mana kau</malay> [eh]

!wow!
[ah] just saying it's recorded again
okay (um)
(um) [eh] but actually you know I was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
like you know you want to make a movie <malay>ke nak</malay> make a television show
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
I don't know whether they're doing it for I don't know whether they are doing it for your for your monday's one [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
it's quite cool mean meaning like <malay>macam kau</malay> imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] you just like
<malay>menyeleweng</malay> it's not is it <malay>menyeleweng</malay> no <malay>menyeleweng</malay> is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
or <malay>macam berbual merepek</malay>
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam apa aku tengah berbual mana tahu</malay> this the idea of me thinking of this idea can be used as an idea for the show
ya
ya okay
<malay>merepek mungkin merepek satu jam dorang dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>apa ni tak ada</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> <malay>tu pasal tu pasal dia kata</malay> seventy to ninety [kan] <malay>dia kasi</malay> seventy [jer] <malay>kalau bagus gitu ni</malay> idea ninety
(hmm)
(mm)
seventy <malay>sana satu orang ke bukan</malay> [kan]
[ah] yes a bit <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> monday
<malay>satu orang</malay> seventy [oh] surveyor survey
[ah]
[ah]
okay
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tak faham</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay I
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
survey offers or any voice recording or any [oh] if you are thinking of doing a podcast [eh] you can actually <malay>ambil kesempatan</malay> [eh]
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
how from talking about how's our day to (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> we asking for job okay [lah] sorry I was cutting you short
I was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya I forgot everything you know you know <malay>yang</malay> the last time <malay>kita buat</malay>
statistics [eh]
[eh] <malay>aku bagus gila</malay> [sia] I think like I can !chey!
[ah] P <malay>abeh lepas tu ada</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> data
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
(mm) I was quite good at it <malay>tapi</malay>
[eh] pure maths <malay>aku pun</malay> okay <malay>tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat</malay> B [oh] I miss out one question
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause I told my teacher [eh] I I skipped one question I don't know how to do <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get A
<malay>agaknya gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>agaknya dorang mark</malay> [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong <malay>sekali dua</malay> question <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>dua</malay> question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] B but <malay>babi</malay>
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like <malay>macam</malay> how do I say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
<malay>macam</malay> normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
<malay>matlamat matlamat</malay>
<malay>maklumat</malay> information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)
okay [lah]
[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
<malay>boleh faham</malay> I take it there
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
our shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the S word <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh] I took my driving <malay>kat</malay>
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the <malay>pakcik pakcik</malay> [ah] I cannot take it like okay there's a few <malay>yang</malay> like <malay>macam muda muda</malay>
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
<malay>dia kata</malay>
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should <malay>gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam</malay> dude I'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why I am wrong
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
<malay>nak</malay>
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't I don't argue over !aiya! just <malay>sabar</malay> patience patience
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] overall but overall I would say (err) cause I the last (err) I took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times I was bad in the circuit then I failed the third time I went out <malay>tapi</malay>
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can I got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure I fail the whole test so I <malay>merajuk sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay>
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then #sharul# [ah] #sharul# took two weeks before me then I met up with him for dinner he said [oh] he pass already then <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then I'm like !wah! so good [ah]
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
like it's already my fourth time [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> like [oh] <malay>penat nya</malay>
and then I was
(err) <malay>dia sekolah</malay> [eh] private private
ya then some more
(err) during my
so my test was (err) example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this (err) I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
<malay>sebab aku macam takut gila</malay> but then monday I just went to the place and then I
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he

I was so touched you know like like yesterday <malay>dia tiba-tiba</malay> texted me say #izwal# (err) cause I ask her before <malay>dia ada</malay> slot <malay>tak kat tempat kerja dia kerja</malay> [lah] then she say don't have then

testing testing one two three [eh] [eh] okay okay [dah] [dah] [dah]
ya ya can can
to cope with the lesson
no I was just thinking okay because my main rationale [kan] was I I mean I could have sign a bond with like hospital <malay>tapi</malay> my main rationale behind not signing a bond because I don't wanna decide on myself too too early because I'm still year one
and then I rather use this time as an experience you know
like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside I'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
then somemore I'm like taking like
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean hospital hospital [lah] but then different hospital is different ways of like
<malay>apa ni</malay> work style environment right so I am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> sign to a place [ah] then <malay>menyesal</malay>
regret

sign on <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
sign on <malay>kena</malay> [eh] no [eh] [ah] I think sign on I will be a nursing officer

until they call you back until they call you back
until they call you back you know

I told you I didn't want that
I told you [what]
there's a possibility that
(um)
(mm)

I would prefer
[oh] okay okay (uh) good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K [lah] I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
<malay>satu ke tepi abeh macam</malay> lazy eye and then the
the distance between each eyes is like right
why do you care about his perspective when you're the one who has to look at him so <malay>mata dia jauh gila</malay>
<malay>abeh hidung dia macam butang</malay>

<malay>kita</malay> poke <malay>nama</malay> [sia]
okay (err)
(mm)
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
(err)
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay [lah] one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
!huh!
!huh!
<malay>tak faham</malay>
so <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> tour guide
I don't understand
<malay>ada ke kerja macam gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm) I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no [lah] in singapore first [lah]
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya [lah] what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and (uh) basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya [lah] with the money then I will do that [lah]
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills [what] and then the cats I rescue them and then [what] feed them [what]
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya [lah]
cause I will invest also [what] so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
<malay>tak itu</malay> those like kittens and <malay>semua</malay> is like
a non-profit organisation
!huh!
(uh) (uh) I cannot [lah]
volunteer [ah]
then you get to play with the cats [sia] so cute
bring [lah]
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya [sia] like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
[eh] then nevermind [lah] they can be bubbles and more [what]
why socks

the kind of names that you want
blossom

bright cats you can't even see them

because that's the most important thing right now
if somebody wants to <malay>jampi</malay> another marriage or something then just tell [lah] why do you need to use <malay>jampi</malay> [sia]

odd weeks you mean what alternate weeks [ah] basically
[eh] why are we talking about this
[eh] but I have always had this like
(err)
thinking
!wah! I I've never believe in all these nonsense [sia] until like
like she told me about the possibility of the
the family using all of these but to me this is all <malay>merepek</malay> and like <malay>syirik</malay>
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now !alamak! mama <malay>balik pula</malay>
okay (err)
okay nevermind let's switch topic first since like
we cannot talk about it now
(um)
(mm)
but what
[oh] ya I wanted to say
I feel like
papa has sense like
<malay>macam pelindung</malay> for like all of us
!huh! your friend can see
what kind of places
no
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>kena kacau macam mana</malay> at the place
<malay>hantu tu takut dengan kau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
you saw
then
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
!huh! <malay>kau punya</malay> like yours
and then
and that's why I thought I said that
I somehow feel like papa send like <malay>pelindung</malay> for us
cause his family also like
<malay>macam orang-orang boyan</malay> and then after that come from the indonesia also [what]
his side
if I'm not wrong
ya [lah]
why do you think <malay>nenek</malay> and <malay>atuk</malay> keep saying that (uh) <malay>mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau</malay> and everything which I find like <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau percaya benda merepek ni semua</malay> but
when I as I grow up and then I try to understand all these different cultural practices then I'm like ya
we cannot be like so dismissive
when there is a possibility of it
(mm)
ya you'll never know [sia]
and he's not that like great also
and then the wife like <malay>macam tunduk dekat dia</malay>
no but I really think that he did send something for us since he like cannot be around us
and then this <malay>pelindung</malay> is fighting with #etol's# thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think
I think
I think
I think these are all signs of
delusion
I think <malay>kita pergi</malay> <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>abeh ustaz ustaz ni ustaz ustaz ni semua berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>kena bayar islam punya</malay>

<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>ni pelindung</malay> if only I can talk to my <malay>pelindung</malay> please do your job you didn't really save me from
making some decisions that I will regret

<malay>lama gila</malay> #dok#
<malay>aku rasa</malay> the last <malay>kita</malay> jam before circuit breaker <malay>atau</malay>
<malay>kita tak</malay> jam <malay>terus lepas balik yang</malay> vietnam <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>lama lama gila lama gila babi</malay>
like <malay>semua semua</malay> put on hold [lah] okay [lah] but at least other bands <malay>macam ada</malay> jam [ah] like space ya quite active [lah] like no cause we also we we also
finishing up our [what]
but then not jamming it's more of mixing but that one also would be like on friday on like
(err) friday night [ah] he
like take some time off just to do the mixing [lah] but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first [lah] cause <malay>dah lama gila</malay> [seh] like hold back <malay>kita punya</malay> recording
so
<malay>entah tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah habis</malay> [ah] <malay>dah habis</malay> mix <malay>dah habis</malay> finally <malay>habis</malay> [ah] like <malay>dah</malay> #swee# [ah] <malay>tinggal hantar</malay> mastering then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> we still finding for for people [lor] (um)
don't know finding the for the best deal expensive [sia] like mastering
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) overseas [ah]
<malay>tapi tak tahu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu dorang boleh dapat</malay> sound <malay>dia ke tak</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> #haji hussin# <malay>boleh</malay>
(err) [oh] <malay>tu dia punya</malay> mixing mastering suite [eh]
<malay>tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang</malay> [ah] try to talk to them we also finding [ah] we will be sitting down
ya I heard [ah] I heard but I will sit down and talk to them see cause we still need to sit down and discuss about the design cause we planning to release like song by song [ah] instead not like all one shot [ah] on spotify [ah]
I don't know [ah] that's the plan [ah] I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like <malay>kita</malay> release <malay>macam</malay> all one shot [kan] <malay>nanti macam</malay> people get bored easily [ah] like [ah] so <malay>kita punya</malay> style <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] I mean is four songs only <malay>apa</malay> it's not it's not like a whole album [lah] if whole album then
planning [ah] there's also the plan to do a video clip [ah]
but but don't know [eh] (err)
what what's the whole concept [ah] you know what I mean the whole concept of the is <malay>macam</malay> is all (err) is is interconnected [ah] is like (err) is like (err) <malay>macam</malay> a story [ah] from song number one to song number four
[ah] yes concept album so <malay>semua macam</malay> interconnected [ah] there's a story to it [ah]
so <malay>kita</malay> plan <malay>macam</malay> release song by song right then every song <malay>ada</malay> different artwork
so the artwork will end up with one whole piece of artwork that is all relatable [ah] (err) so
ya [lah] that's the plan [lah] but we need to sit down and talk again [lah] cause also budget [lah] budget we of course to do video like this must have you know (err)
budget [ah] see what kind of concept [lah] then also must pay for mastering (err) then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see [ah] we'll see how it goes [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan kayuh</malay> [ah]
well okay [lah] at least moving [lah] you know cause we were we were stuck [ah] cause of the circuit breaker [ah] cause we were already in the process already
mixing during before circuit breaker like really
(uh) most likely will be #wan# G [lah]
in-house [ah] better [ah] cause he cause he understands the song or if not we try to
I mean like me #hanis# #akid# sit we sat down and talk we we say maybe we can call #zaki# [lah] #zaki# ex-member [pe] so at least he kind of have the same feel of the band [lah] [ah] but see how [ah] if he is interested [ah] if not then we get #wan# G [lah] you know at least so I mean #zaki# left the band
<malay>tapi dia</malay> still <malay>macam</malay> part of it [pe] part of us <malay>dia tak keluar</malay> like know <malay>tak keluar</malay> in a bad terms <malay>dia keluar</malay> in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning [pe] ya so then <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] then we will we'll see how [ah] <malay>kita nanti duduk berbual</malay> we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
#zaki# freelance [ah]

<malay>hujung tahun ni</malay> [ah]
ya true
[oh] beat a
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] but at least you guys went tour already [sia]
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
I think [sial] is very influential <malay>macam banyak</malay> influence (err) <malay>orang-orang</malay> probably also cause of
<malay>dia</malay> female fronted
<malay>abeh</malay> and then <malay>nyanyi</malay> malay <malay>lagu melayu</malay>
then very very strong musical <malay>apa</malay>
musically very strong [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah] that's good
<malay>bagus juga</malay> rare <malay>juga nampak</malay> band <malay>macam</malay> gitu like playing <malay>macam</malay>
those dark waves
<malay>betul aku</malay> realise that <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
I mean <malay>aku ikut korang yang</malay> time europe tour <malay>aku</malay> realise actually <malay>aku</malay> get to see many things
with little cost [ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
but then again I think the twenty four hours <malay>pun macam</malay> can feel the vibe [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you are still <malay>macam dekat</malay> another country [orh] then you see like even though <malay>macam</malay> say for example [eh] for example <malay>kau main</malay> germany [ah] but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different [ah]
so at least you get to see that culture know <malay>macam</malay> #berlin# really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very <malay>ni</malay> and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very <malay>kampung</malay> like in <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] but then
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours [eh] is also to me an opener [ah] it's still fun [ah] it's still fun [ah] I mean as following tour [ah] so
yes
ya [lah]
but then again also I think it's not also about touring [ah] I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring [ah] you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe [ah] then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
<malay>macam</malay> save cost [ah] <malay>kau tak payah</malay> spend <malay>duit</malay> on <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> lodging <malay>dorang</malay> will <malay>kasi kau</malay> crash <malay>tempat dorang</malay> I mean that's the give and take [ah] you know
ya so
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
<malay>asal</malay>
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
I mean I think <malay>dia</malay> maybe that his style [ah] if he don't like that culture or not say culture [ah] he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go [lah]
[ah] same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks [ah] two weeks <malay>pun dah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>kalau tak rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
that's why
cause <malay>aku</malay> realise #siti# is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social <malay>apa</malay> instagram
she can travel alone <malay>dia boleh</malay> travel alone <malay>pergi macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>gila</malay> cause <malay>aku</malay> realise cause <malay>bila</malay> that time <malay>kita dekat</malay> london <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> willing to go <malay>jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai</malay> explore [seh] like like she knows her way [ah] like to to just explore [ah] <malay>dia tak takut</malay> she got she's fearless [ah] but I think
that something <malay>yang</malay> holding her back [ah]
scared [sia]
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person [ah]
ya but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku pun nak</malay> tour [lah] <malay>dengan macam</malay> urgent matter I mean missy shoot <malay>lain sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kalau nak</malay> tour
probably <malay>lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> #lal# <malay>pun macam</malay> #iman's# league right and then it's very
it'll be hard [lah] I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was #iman's# league [ah] then he came back so but I think he he still very on [lah] he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask [eh] does this <malay>ni kena tak</malay>
then <malay>macam tak</malay> [ah] <malay>ni tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> very very #iman's# league [ah] okay <malay>tak apa</malay> then <malay>dia akan tukar</malay> to change to <malay>kita punya</malay> vibe
<malay>selalunya</malay> is #dol# or most of the time is #dol# [lah]
but [ah] #lal# recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs [ah] one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas [lah] lyric lyric wise would be #dol# [lah] cause his lyrics are actually very good
#hakim# fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
he he he did give some ideas (err) when we take in some ideas some ideas <malay>macam tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into <malay>macam</malay> very rubik's vibes
[ah] skate punk like a lot of
you know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) but he will try to control he he don't want to <malay>macam dia tak nak tukar</malay> the sounds
[ah] bad religion I mean influence [ah] cause we influence with bad religion <malay>abeh macam</malay> influence with rise against #dol# <malay>punya</malay> influence is heavily rise against
heavy #lal# is very melodic guy #lal# <malay>suka</malay> melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with <malay>macam</malay> he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he <malay>dia banyak macam</malay> on that vibe but <malay>aku</malay> is more very bad religion penny wise [ah]
#hakim# is very #propagandhi#
[ah] #propagandhi# (err) that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but <malay>bagusnya</malay> everything is jumble up you see so <malay>semua dah</malay> jumble up <malay>semua dah macam</malay>
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part [ah]
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah]
confirm blast [kan]
[oh] [oh] #farhan# [eh]
but <malay>entah</malay> [eh]
but but
[ah] ya
<malay>dia macam</malay> very (err) straight [kan]
<malay>tapi dorang tak tahu</malay> [ah] #zul# <malay>dah tak cakap dengan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> bob [ah] [eh] practise [ah] single pedal <malay>aku</malay> feel playing single pedal
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel [lah] you can also hear that is double [ah] like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
<malay>yang buat dia</malay> very unique [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> unique <malay>gila</malay> [ah] but then [ah] to each its own [ah] style [ah] ya but see [ah] see [ah] I don't know [ah] we still got a
right
I don't know [ah] is their style [ah]
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song [ah] that kind of vibe [ah] but then
[ah] ya ya
ya relevant bands [ah]
<malay>betul dorang dah</malay> boring [ah]
they they they they suck life [ah] or they suck [ah] actually personally I don't listen to them already [ah] like rarely listen to them
bad religion still stick to that sound but then <malay>ada</malay> modern element I feel [ah] that's how I feel
penny wise will still be that sound [ah] cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
(err) still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album [what]
last year [ah] not bad [lah] but still the same sound [ah]
I like penny wise but I still prefer
he got a vibe [ah] a different vibe I still like bad religion [ah] cause <malay>dorang</malay>
cause they very <malay>abang abang</malay>
ya [ah] professor professor [sia] vocalist professor [siol] [sia]
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene [ah] they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like (err) surfers and skateboarders [mah]
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets [ah] but they are very intelligent people [ah]
tony hawk pro skater [eh]
no I don't like him [ah]
I don't know [ah] he some pop punkers like feeling feeling <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> very <malay>kental</malay> [ah] I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing [ah]
but cannot [ah]
but okay [lah] see how [lah] missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause #wan# G got a new bass
<malay>tapi tengah</malay> set [ah]
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
[ah] I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape [one] then he just need to redo the everything [ah] so he give to #hakim# #hakim#
#maggot# #maggot# [ah] #maggot# setting up for him [ah] then he gonna after that we jam [ah]
composer
all of us [ah] together but #wan# G is the one that do everything [lah] so
yes (err) so we input ideas [lah] [ah] like but but #wan# G will will #wan# G will do first [lah] at home then after that after he do
then will send us then <malay>cakap</malay> okay (err) <malay>ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit</malay>
(err) then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then <malay>bila</malay> time <malay>jumpa baru</malay> like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then <malay>dah</malay> [lah] see how <malay>pasal kita</malay> record with no clicks then very simple (err)
miking <malay>macam</malay> drums only four mikes (err) so that's why some sound <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>tak boleh dapat</malay> and stuff [lah] but we this is like a trial [ah] for me [lah] it's a trial [ah] but then <malay>nanti tengok</malay> [ah] like in future future recording <malay>kita</malay> do it like better [ah]
cause #hakim# <malay>macam dah</malay> offer [eh] next recording <malay>aku aku</malay> will make sure like all the all the miking will be better [lah]
I don't know he [ah] to me it's okay [lah]
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something [lah] and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
ya [lah] that's why <malay>dia dia</malay> discovered <malay>tu pasal</malay> that time actually <malay>dia</malay> offered to <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam kau nak</malay> rerecord <malay>balik kau punya</malay> drum but then
[ah] but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada</malay> click [orh] we don't play with click so it's gonna be <malay>susah</malay> [sia] like okay [lah] we try [ah] I did record like what (um) we tried half a song [ah] but it's difficult cause there's no click
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] like <malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] so then I think then I told him next time [ah] like the next time we we we try to record
(err) better [ah]
cause he discover but good thing that but good [ah] he's very hardworking <malay>dia</malay> discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input [lah] but then again it's not a bad recording [ah] this time
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound [eh] I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
correct but then have to be patient [ah] but then but then again for example this spacedays <malay>punya</malay>
spacedays <malay>punya</malay> vibe is because we we needed to
do it fast [ah] cause we delay too long already [ah] [ah] so we we we say never mind [lah] we we we told #hakim# next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you [ah] but because we already comfortable [eh] and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff [lah]
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like [ah] [ah] recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
[ah] bass man [ah] it I think is
big one the big one tall one [ah] bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish <malay>balik</malay> (err) for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky [ah] I think I think he's damn lucky [ah] like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
<malay>dia rajin gila</malay> [ah] ya but good [lah] know he he he he invests on that [lah] he invests on that then to have like
good sounds for the band [lah]
so far his recordings are actually good [ah] his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good [ah] for me [lah] personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient #yadi# is [lah]
cause must commit correct must commit
cause #hakim# is very hardworking that is his his income [pe] his livelihood [pe]
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands [lah] but from what
then <malay>apa tu</malay> force vomit <malay>pun tengah</malay> record
[ah] then recently <malay>dia cakap</malay> last week [eh] last week <malay>dia cakap</malay> dia record <malay>dikir barat</malay>
[sia]
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this #ranggi# #ranggi# guys [ah] #ranggi# is the motorcycle <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so #ranggi# is actually <malay>macam</malay> (um)
#ranggi# is (err) some of them <malay>ada budak-budak dikir barat</malay> [ah]
so I think <malay>dorang</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> #hakim# is a <malay>buat</malay> sounds [pe]
so <malay>dia macam pergi dekat dia</malay> [lah] but then <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] then it's like side bazaar bush man <malay>dia punya</malay> side project
no no no he he got another reggae band
(err)
#adib# I think #adib# playing bass (err) then got (err) (um) #restam# bushman <malay>main</malay> guitar then (err) #rizal# #rizal# <malay>dulu main</malay> sound of province #rizal# <malay>main</malay> sound of province <malay>dulu</malay>
#rizal# <malay>kecil</malay>
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer [ah] ya ya ya #rizal#
he covered [ah] session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer [lah] then <malay>dia main</malay> for this band <malay>aku tak tahu siapa lagi</malay> a few more guys [ah] like play for his band
so I think recorded there also
(err) even stoned revivals [ah] remix sound that song [oh] no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it (err) make it into malay also (err) I think #goodil# [eh]
ya [lah] but how they do it right is like (err) (err)
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia #esam# #esam# australia #esam# will record
(err) we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here [ah]
so <malay>dorang macam</malay> rerecord <malay>balik</malay> [ah] ya
(um) but then financially maybe <malay>tak sangat</malay> [lah]
ya but it also depends on him [what] he I don't know but
don't know [ah] but
I I don't know [ah] but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay [lah] I think #zad# also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good [ah]
youtube #siao# he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out [ah] into it [ah]
yes correct
but then see [lah] maybe maybe in future [lah] maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest [ah] but one thing about #zad# I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good [sia] cause he feels #paiseh# [lah] want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use [lah] I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks [lah] cause it's a wear and tear
[ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>tak aku cakap dengan</malay> #zad# <malay>juga</malay> #zad# <malay>dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh</malay> then <malay>tiba-tiba macam korang main</malay> <malay>semua cakap</malay> #zad# <malay>kau nak pakai pakai</malay> [ah] kau nak pakai pakai [ah] [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> [jer] it's a wear and tear thing
<malay>aku tahu dia mahal</malay> but then I'm giving you that that green light <malay>apa</malay> that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay [ah] understand sometimes people don't want to <malay>terhutang budi kau tahu</malay>
that's why
<malay>tak</malay> maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe <malay>dulu dia pernah macam</malay> have this friend who like okay just use [ah] then after that after using already then like [eh] !wah! now I want to you never give me back <malay>macam</malay> you know
#jialat# [ah] #jialat# got friend [ah] but then <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] but I'm okay [ah] kalau #zad# <malay>nak pinjam</malay>
of course
<malay>dah</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> end of the day also all the stuff <malay>macam</malay> like it's a wear and tear <malay>punya benda</malay> [pe] so
<malay>tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah</malay> [eh] you also broken [what] it'll also break [what] like know like so it's okay [lah] I mean the thing is
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable [what] it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay [lah] I mean I understand
ya that's why <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] I know he's been <malay>macam dia berbual dengan aku</malay> [ah] like cannot wait [sia] I cannot wait to play drums [sia]
[ah] I cannot wait to <malay>lepak</malay> I cannot wait to record you know I told him [lah] if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us [lah] we can help you set up the mic setting [ah]
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
like I know he don't want to <malay>terhutang budi</malay> that's confirm and maybe his style is different <malay>dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold [eh] <malay>macam</malay> don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt [what] hurt the feeling hurt [what] so I don't think he's like that
but <malay>kita dah cakap</malay> [ah] I mean I already told him also [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> need to record you need help you just call us [lah] [ah] we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you [ah] cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help <malay>lepak</malay>
[ah] we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him [lah] if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever [lah] run everything if [ah] confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury [lah] so then

he confirm don't want
ya [lah]
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right #zad# was okay #zad# wanted to do it he injured [what]
[ah]
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot <malay>pikiran</malay> you know just go regret <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] regret after that [ah] but there's no regret [ah] I mean for me personally when I went (err) the walk was was <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] the starting was fun cause everything but
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental [ah] mental [ah] it's it is more of mental
no but she also was struggling [ah] cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like [eh] guys guys <malay>sekejap sekejap sekejap</malay> stop stop stop <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] so we actually sat down and #azil# <malay>macam</malay> okay no problem no problem <malay>duduk</malay>
then it was like <malay>matahari dekat mata</malay> the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay> #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay>
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend [what] then then we just walk [ah] so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to #punggol# end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk [ah]
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] for me [ah] personally but I told them sorry [ah] I say #paiseh# #paiseh# [ah] like we have to have a lot of stops
[ah] but #azil# also said never mind [ah] we take it slow [ah] don't don't
don't force yourself [lah] you know then to give up also now is like wasted [sia] ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself [ah]
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle [ah] [ah] so we did manage to finish [ah] so the moment we touch that thing right <malay>kita cakap kita sampai</malay> right
<malay>macam macam</malay> #azil# we made it [ah] we just high five [sia]
[eh] take photo take photo take photo <malay>lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan</malay> I lie down already [sia] I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks #azil# take out socks take out shoes #aisyah# also sit down then all <malay>termenung</malay> already like good twenty minutes
twenty minutes half an hour after that #aisyah# like okay [ah] then we all like come [lah] let's go [ah] #hafiz# waiting
[eh] #hafiz# fetching [ah] <malay>jalan</malay> to the #punggol# settlement there is like another one click [ah]
[ah] [ah]
one point five click [ah] <malay>betul</malay>
so we had to walk for one plus click [ah]
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
so that was the slowest walk to #punggol# (err) settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already [ah] like [oh] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>mata dah rabak</malay> I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also <malay>malas</malay> you know like want to <malay>minum air</malay> just drink water [ah] drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually #hamimah# #zafran# all they wake already they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay>
ya [lah] breakfast but cause #aisyah# [ah] #hafiz# fetching #aisyah# [mah] so they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay> then they ask you and #nazril# <malay>kau dengan</malay> #nazril# plan [ah] <malay>nak pergi makan mana</malay> then <malay>kita jumpa</malay> somewhere <malay>tu aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah]

<malay>dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari</malay> toilet <malay>aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah</malay> slow <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>aku duduk aku duduk macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] to go into the car also <malay>macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] <malay>rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[ah]
#siao#
[ah] [ah]
[oh] there the park connector [ah]
go to coastal
east coast
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [oh] ya ya cause coastal
it's wrong coastal the coastal #tanah merah# coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
twenty one [eh] like like almost twenty clicks [ah] actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way (err) #hud# told me is about twenty five clicks <malay>ye</malay>
ya so ya [lah] but don't know [ah] but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard [ah]
so ya [lah] but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
<malay>tak</malay> but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
whatever we can cut we cut [ah] no [lah] but
#yio chu kang# #sengkang# cannot [ah] must go that way no actually right
[oh] cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the #buangkok# is the nearest to reach [ah] but that one is also quite a stretch [ah]
[ah] [ah] but but is like you walk walk [eh] park connector park connector then you see [eh] #sengkang# already
that #sengkang# we thought you is after that bridge thought the #sengkang# is already #punggol# <malay>sekali</malay> [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> it's another #sengkang#
the other end then you go in front another bridge [oh] that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of #sengkang#
then you go to #punggol# so that from #punggol# the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay [ah] this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just #sumang#
so that #sumang# is the end the beginning of that #sumang# is like the end middle of #punggol# [lah] that #sumang#
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector <malay>dia macam sampai dekat</malay> red bridge [tau] but this one is before red bridge <malay>kau dah belok kiri</malay>
so there's another route [ah] so there's another route to walk

everything about money [lah] [eh]
because although once you being rich you still think about money [ah] that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
(uh) I want to have a baby [lah] at least <malay>kalau ada</malay>
stable <malay>punya ni</malay>
(uh) stable financial [eh]
(uh) at least <malay>dah boleh ada anak</malay>
<malay>pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli susu</malay> everything [kan]
[ah] so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>lebih baik</malay> (uh)
<malay>dah ada</malay> stable <malay>semua</malay> financial <malay>baru ada</malay> baby [ah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> stable <malay>nanti anak nak makan apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>takkan nak kebulur makan pasir</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>jadi</malay> at least <malay>kalau kita dah ada duit</malay> [ah] at least we also
<malay>sebelum jadi</malay> richest <malay>pun kita nak kena pandai</malay> save <malay>duit</malay>
[ah] save <malay>duit</malay> you need to have plan about money [ha]
<malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>kalau kau dah</malay> plan [ah] <malay>semua jadi</malay> at least <malay>bila kau ada anak</malay>
<malay>nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan</malay> cheap [eh]
<malay>memang mahal</malay> [lah] <malay>mahal gila</malay> [lah] [eh]
<malay>lagi-lagi buku dia orang lagi baju sekolah apa semua</malay> [ah] <malay>abeh dia orang punya tambang pergi sekolah apa semua</malay>
<malay>abeh kau nak kena hantar apa semua</malay> unless <malay>kau nak belikan basikal</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk anak kau</malay> [kan]
<malay>basikal</malay> so <malay>suruh dia orang ajar dia orang macam mana nak kayuh basikal</malay> so at least they can
ride their own bicycle to school [ah] [kan]
so from there also safe you see everything think about money [eh]
[ah] <malay>semua pasal duit</malay> okay <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu semua aku [dah] fikir fikir pasal ada anak semua aku [dah] fikir pasal</malay> future [lah]

we can save up money save up some money [lah]
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
one day <malay>ke ataupun kita</malay> picnic [jer] <malay>kat situ sampai esok pagi</malay> so at least boleh

<malay>satu rumah</malay> [what] [ah] then <malay>yang lain dah kahwin yang</malay> <malay>yang kita nak ajak ni</malay> cousin <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [ah] so
it's okay since <malay>dia boleh bawa</malay> husband <malay>dia sekali</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(um) you know that (uh)
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
[ah] they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you [lah]
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest (uh) maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso [kan]
so maybe <malay>barang-barang yang kita beli kat</malay> daiso <malay>tu kita boleh buat sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>tampal sendiri</malay>
tapi apa yang <malay>aku rasa lagi</malay> save is <malay>macam hari ni</malay> birthday our cousin [kan] then the next day birthday <malay>abang</malay> [kan]
my husband [eh] <malay>jadi</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam kita buat macam</malay>
(uh) eleven plus <malay>gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas</malay> so at least <malay>kita</malay> celebrate
<malay>satu kali jalan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [kan] so it's better right
so at least time <malay>kita</malay> celebrate okay (uh) <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>tiup tiup tiup</malay> [oh] okay okay <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kira macam satu</malay> cake
[ah] then <malay>kita</malay> celebrate <malay>untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu</malay>
(mm) so like that better right
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
(uh) <malay>kita</malay> picnic <malay>kat</malay> west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ke</malay>
marina <malay>ke</malay>
(err)
ya [lah] marina is nice [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(err) whatsoever [lah] <malay>payung besar sudah</malay>
(mmhmm)
splash
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually right I got saw that time inside a website [ah] I not sure is it at west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast
<malay>yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam khemah kat dalam ada</malay> sofa <malay>ada macam</malay> I think it's sofa ya
I think that one is quite cheap also
because (um) that time I saw a youtuber
<malay>dia orang buat</malay> (uh) <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira macam tempat murah-murah</malay> [lah] <malay>kat macam</malay>
<malay>yang kau boleh ni</malay> [ah] <malay>kira boleh</malay> chill chill <malay>dia orang cakap</malay>
<malay>sekali aku tengok</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] not bad <malay>siak dalam ada ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>kira macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang tengok ada</malay> table <malay>kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu</malay> sofa
[ah] <malay>itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar</malay> so if raining <malay>dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this [lah]
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
[ah]
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
[ah] so maybe we can go for that one [ah]
(mm) so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you [ah] so we no need to go for separate rooms [what]
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk [ah]
cannot gathering [ah] cannot make side illegal gathering
[ah] cannot gossip [ah]
so at least at least [lah] (mm) so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but (uh) morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing <malay>ke</malay> zipline <malay>ke</malay> if
have [lah]
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle [ah] I not sure
but they can (uh) ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride [ha]
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part [lah] that we can do
[ah]
maybe we can plan saturday morning
(mm) no maybe afternoon
[oh] ya because actually we don't want
(um)
we don't want
<malay>abang</malay> to (mm)
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
(mmhmm)
the next morning we go cycling
[oh] over there if I not wrong got burger king [eh]
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin [ah]
ya that's why
but I think (uh) over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure [ah]
(hmm) maybe we can search everything
(um)
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I don't like to roller blade [lah] actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see [seh] don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay [lah] nevermind [lah]
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
!alah! !huh!
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it [lah]
like that [lor]
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct [lah] it's boring [lah] because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay> [ah]
ya very very cold
(mmhmm) ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
!wah! we die
(mmhmm)
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I !aiyo! if I go there [eh]
<malay>nak buat apa</malay> [seh]
(mm) confirm like <malay>macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>panas terik</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah</malay> !aduh!
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly [ah] if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious [ah] they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
<malay>mak</malay> [kan] <malay>tengah sakit</malay> also right so
maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> <malay>akan bawa</malay> [lah]
<malay>takkan tak bawa</malay> [kan] <malay>gila tak bawa</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang pun</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang</malay> [kan]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya [lah] I think (um)
confirm <malay>kalau</malay> shopping <malay>kita punya</malay> cousin
<malay>adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila</malay> shopping
especially <malay>kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka</malay> shopping shopping <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> shopping <malay>baju baju baju</malay>
<malay>baju</malay> [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
maybe [lah] <malay>kita</malay> just go with the <malay>yang pergi berkelah tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>lagipun kita dah lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pergi berkelah</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>

maybe we can buy some snack [ah]
so that when we <malay>lepak</malay>
<malay>kita boleh ni</malay> [ah]
<malay>makan makan makan</malay> [ah] <malay>sambil lepak tengok</malay> if I not wrong have

barbecue pit still <malay>nak buat</malay> barbecue pit
<malay>kita masak</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>masak lepas tu bawa</malay>
since <malay>kita</malay> like what you say <malay>nak pergi petang</malay> [kan] [ah] okay [lah]
but you know like this kind of
[ah] <malay>tempat</malay> sometimes especially weekend
always have (uh) family gathering [kan]
so I think like <malay>kita nak kena</malay> book
(uh) <malay>ni cepat sikit</malay>
(mm)
if not <malay>kita terlambat kita tak dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>tempat</malay>
maybe some of us <malay>ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu</malay> so at least
<malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa sampai siang</malay> [kan]
<malay>kalau sampai siang</malay> at least <malay>kita ada tempat</malay> [tau] <malay>ada tempat</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay> book <malay>untuk berapa orang</malay>
[ah] so at least <malay>dah ada orang</malay> [tau]
[ah] <malay>dekat tu tempat</malay>
<malay>jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil</malay> [ah]
they
ya but you need to book also you know
[a'ah]
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside !alamak! inside your tent
[ah] then you say [eh] <malay>salah salah salah tempat</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> also cannot [what]
[oh] ya we should have a receipt [eh] (mm)
after we already book we should have a receipt [ah]
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
energetic [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
(mm) !hey! ya
ya
about guitar right you love playing guitar right you also already composed a new song right
ya
ya drama <malay>melayu sangat</malay> !aduh!
(mmhmm)
ya ya correct
and like what we say [kan] <malay>kita nak</malay> standby <malay>duit lebih sikit</malay> is because <malay>balik</malay>
[kan] <malay>kita nak</malay> grab [kan] <malay>jadi balik</malay> confirm <malay>penat</malay> [pe] <malay>kita dah ada</malay> activity [kan] <malay>lepas tu balik penat</malay> confirm <malay>nak</malay> grab [kan]
so that's why that's why I <malay>cakap yang ini</malay> I <malay>rasa lagi kita boleh</malay> save
<malay>kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh</malay> pack
<malay>semua</malay> pack what I think is
better rather than <malay>kita bawa satu-satu gitu</malay>
then <malay>bawa banyak pinggan</malay>
it's better that <malay>kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu</malay> pack
so <malay>bila tu kita tinggal</malay> pass [jer] <malay>kat</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
so <malay>dalam</malay> everything <malay>kita boleh letak</malay> but like <malay>macam dia punya</malay> side
<malay>macam</malay> hotdog <malay>ke macam</malay> crabstick <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]

(uh) something like maybe <malay>lemak cili padi ke apa</malay>
<malay>tak payah</malay>

<malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
<malay>roti</malay> sandwich yes
of course we have

(mm)
I think
<malay>apa yang kita perlu ada</malay> since <malay>ada</malay> event [kan] sandwich of course <malay>kena ada</malay>
so (um) that's why I <malay>cakap</malay> at least I <malay>nak letak satu</malay> dish
so <malay>bila ada satu</malay> dish <malay>tu</malay>
[kan]
at least <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>lauk macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kau makan mi dengan</malay>
<malay>lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng</malay> [jer] <malay>kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng</malay>
so at least <malay>kalau ada lauk sikit</malay> because
<malay>kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah</malay> [kan]
that's why I <malay>cakap</malay>
so at least I <malay>nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa</malay> [ah] something like that [lah]
ya like what I say maybe I <malay>nak buat yang tu</malay>
<malay>lemak cili padi ataupun</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay>
(uh) <malay>sambal goreng satu sambal goreng</malay> <malay>satu lemak cili padi</malay>
<malay>sambal goreng</malay> is for mama because mama vegetarian
<malay>kita kena fikir nanti</malay> mama <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>sana ayam</malay>
[eh] <malay>sini ayam</malay>
<malay>abeh sini sini pun ayam abeh aku punya mana</malay>

<malay>dengan apa</malay> tofu mushroom [ah]
some kind of this kind [lah] (uh) <malay>yang kita kena beli</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> bring along mama [kan]
(mm)
(mm)

ya
(mmhmm)
you want to buy <malay>mi</malay> [eh] buy <malay>pula</malay> you want to <malay>masak mi hoon ke mi goreng</malay>
I think <malay>mi hoon goreng</malay> is better right because we got a lot right
so at least we can save [lah] save a bit
like over there (mm)
so you want to cook <malay>nasi goreng</malay> is it
how about like this
so you want me to cook the <malay>nasi goreng cina</malay>
I <malay>masak nasi goreng ikan bilis</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ikan bilis sedap sikit</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>ikan bilis itu</malay> [lah] that is what I mean
<malay>nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini</malay> [pe] is <malay>warna putih</malay> [what]
(mm)
maybe [eh]
(uh) okay maybe that is the good idea [lah]
okay so you help me <malay>nanti potong-potong ayam</malay>
we <malay>potong</malay>
ya you <malay>potong ayam</malay>
so <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>nak masak lauk</malay> [pe]
(mm)
<malay>abang suruh potong</malay> hotdog [ah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>dua</malay> packet <malay>cukup tak dua</malay> packet <malay>tak cukup empat</malay> packet
<malay>empat</malay> packet [lah] [eh] <malay>empat</malay> packet
but one thing I don't like is because I <malay>punya</malay> cut [eh] of hotdog [eh] is different
<malay>memang aku punya</malay> is like <malay>memang</malay>
slide slide (uh) ni <malay>apa</malay>
slice <malay>dia macam</malay> diagonal is it
diagonal [kan]
[ah] so
<malay>aku tak nak</malay> [lah] macam
<malay>kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar</malay> because
<malay>aku punya orang</malay> is very particular about <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau aku buat macam mana dia orang ni kalau suruh masak pun susah</malay>
[ah]
sandwich <malay>lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> especially sandwich <malay>ni aku tak suka</malay> very particular [lah]
[oh] <malay>takpe</malay>
<malay>kita buat macam ni</malay> [jer] <malay>apa kata kita buat</malay>
[ah]
egg tuna sandwich
so <malay>sebelah sapu</malay> tuna [lah]
<malay>lagi sebelah kita letak</malay> egg [lah] egg mayo [lah]
[ah] <malay>jadi bila</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia jadi sedap</malay> [tau] [ah] I think this already good [lah]
so <malay>jadi dia orang tak ni</malay>
<malay>jadi dia orang kalau</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> spread
[ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ni sangat</malay> [kan]
<malay>sayur</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal apa kalau sayur</malay>
<malay>tu yang aku tak nak dia orang buat kalau letak sayur nanti bersepah dia orang buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
no
ya because they don't really know <malay>macam mana nak letak</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau pun tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku kalau buat</malay> sandwich <malay>aku</malay> very particular <malay>aku nak</malay> make sure sandwich <malay>dia nampak</malay> <malay>cantik</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
so <malay>beli yang ada cili punya</malay>
you know <malay>itu baru sedap</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(ugh) [oh] that's so much work [ah] you need to do [ah]
so the crust <malay>apa awak nak buat ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think maybe <malay>kalau macam gini</malay>
since <malay>ada</malay> sandwich and <malay>ada ni</malay> then <malay>kita nak beli</malay>
(uh) since
like that right I think (um)
fishball <malay>nak letak ke</malay>
<malay>ke tak payah</malay>
since (uh) mama <malay>tak makan</malay>
so why not we change it we just (uh) buy everything (uh) veg veg also quite nice [what]
mushroom ball
(mmhmm)
ya nugget fried chicken [ah]
that is what we going to buy [lah]
actually I want to cook fries also
so at least <malay>kita boleh buat</malay> cheese fries
[oh] ya correct because we don't want the food to be soggy right
if not <malay>nanti sampai sana semua dah</malay> taste not nice ya
(mmhmm)
yes instead of
(mm) correct
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] like what we suggest
<malay>kita nak beli</malay> mat <malay>yang dua</malay> dollar <malay>tu</malay>
ya
that one also better right
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun fikir-fikir juga</malay>
but I think this is already nice planning [ah]
that's why
but make sure [lah] this time round happen [lah] [eh]
because when we plan like what <malay>abang</malay> say when we plan every time
<malay>mesti tak jadi</malay> [seh] everything <malay>tak jadi tak jadi</malay> !huh!
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya that's why
correct correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think why not we just buy a dress for <malay>kak nadiah</malay>
then for <malay>abang</malay> (uh) <malay>kita beli kasut</malay> [jer]
at least <malay>baju</malay> [kan]
cause I think
she really need <malay>baju</malay>
since <malay>dia tak habis-habis cakap kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju</malay> [kan] [ah]
so I think better right my suggest better right
(mm)
but I know she like denim jacket also
ya why not [ah] buy denim right
denim means <malay>kita</malay> lump sum [pe] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> sharing [what] <malay>duit</malay> share right so <malay>beli satu</malay> it's considered cheap [what]
<malay>kita beli kat</malay> uniqlo
event
yes yes yes
but since <malay>kita nak pergi tu kita kena</malay>
<malay>bawa baju</malay> extra [lah]
(mmhmm)
[ah]
so <malay>balik</malay> time <malay>baju</malay> colour <malay>ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>pergi baju</malay> colour <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>betul tak</malay>
of course not black colour maybe blue
maybe first day navy blue <malay>ke</malay> because everybody can have blue colour since <malay>kak nadiah kau pun suka</malay> blue colour
<malay>aini kau suka</malay> blue colour
<malay>abang kau pun ada</malay> blue colour <malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah] so
<malay>kita boleh</malay> go with the blue colour [lah] navy blue then the second day
(mm) <malay>balik</malay> time maybe
(mmhmm) (mm)
don't go for something that are not safe when raining I mean green is it
[oh] <malay>dah macam</malay> time <malay>aku nikah</malay> green and blue
(mm)
okay [lah] not bad [lah] but green colour [oh] ya I got
I got my <malay>jubah</malay>
pink also can I got no issue about pink colour I think <malay>abang</malay> also got no issue
but <malay>nanti dia kena pakai</malay> smart smart <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay>
<malay>apa ni nak pergi</malay> picnic <malay>kena pakai</malay> smart smart because the pink colour is <malay>dia punya</malay> smart casual
one ya <malay>kena gosok</malay>
but that one become smart casual [ah] ya <malay>abeh nanti macam tak gosok gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah]
pink that side people got pink colour or not [ha]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
correct [ah]
!huh! black black is obedient
obedient [eh]
forbidden [a'ah] forbidden <malay>jadi</malay> obedient
<malay>kelakar</malay> [seh]

okay so is actually (um) in which year [eh] you <malay>nak</malay> get married [eh
[oh] so this one is (um) actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding [kan
tru
(um) but again I thin
(err) you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a <malay>bilik</malay> or a room <malay>yang</malay> like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with [lah] correct or no
ya [lah] correct [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I think you you both have to think what's the budget [lah] so budget actually <malay>berapa</malay> is it a combined wedding <malay>ke</malay
(mm) okay okay [lah] then I think <malay>kita</malay> we have to take a look part by part [lah] [kan] like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and (um) so basically is between like (err) in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need [kan] <malay>macam</malay> lik
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
which one you want to cut down [ah] on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say (uh) if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat [lah] because apparently like <malay>macam</malay> flat <malay>kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat</malay> !chey! <malay>sepanjang hayat</malay> [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
like I say (uh) the the most important thing is the the the <malay>nikah</malay> itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
(um) family support have to come in so that's why that day you all <malay>kena macam</malay> plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture [lah] that [one] have to be very like (um
(um) very like (uh) transparent but in the event if let's say both side <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you <malay>ada</malay> your own plan of your (uh) I mean his side <malay>ada dia punya</malay> own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to <malay>fikir</malay> or think about i
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb <malay>tak</malay> so that is another another way [lah] [kan] <malay>macam kita nak</malay> (um) try to put everything in hand [lah
so wedding time at least your side <malay>macam</malay> okay then for your side (uh) you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget [eh] sometimes <malay>kita kena fikir</malay> that in terms o
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in <malay>kita punya (err) <malay>orang melayu kita macam</malay> sensitive [ah] about <malay>duit ni</malay> so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families <malay>belum</malay> sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about <malay>duit pun kita adik-beradik masih</malay> sensitive <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [eh] just <malay>bang aku mau pinjam duit kau</malay> [lah] <malay>satu ribu macam suka suka</malay> [jer] <malay>nak minta [kan] abang</malay> you know I have to be like more tactful to u
<malay>kak</malay> are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case <malay>lagi</malay> the other party <malay>yang</malay> your parents <malay>belum kenal</malay> [kan] and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the
then (err) you and #hairin# you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you [dah] sample among all again okay [lah] <malay>kita</malay> work combine then okay celebrate <malay>buat</malay> combine <malay>tapi</malay> if let's say [oh
[ah] you know [lah] I still want my one thousand guest let's say #hairin# <malay>punya</malay> side the
your mother say okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] based on your budget <malay>kita</malay> invite <malay>saudara mara dekat</malay> [jer] one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
because there are two factors you need to think first (um) <malay>kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak</malay> because you all just become a new family member secon
(err) then is like you al
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup [lah] <malay>tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh</malay> then after this the next time <malay>dia pergi rumah</malay
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
like <malay>macam</malay> (err
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get (err
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
and then july got a flat [ah] my <malay>kita punya</malay> timeline two years <malay>tu nak engage</malay
you know then <malay>tak tahu macam mana tahu</malay> bought flat then because [ah] because <malay>atuk</malay> said better
<malay>cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri</malay> then after that we are like [ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] haywire all I received only fla
<malay>kita punya</malay> like dream wedding <malay>kita punya</malay> dream vacation <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] flash toilet [jer] <malay>tu begitu</malay> [ah] so it's lik
then after that I think (um) at that tim
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
(um) <malay>makanan tapi</malay> [kan] shamefully I have to admit even I [dah] work that time [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay> afford [tau] because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like <malay>macam</malay> even like you know the bridal like you all have all these [ah] then I think I can only afford the photos <malay>begitu</malay> that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even <malay>hantaran nak</malay> exchange [ah
(um) I think quite I I would say I like <malay>macam</malay> drag it [lah] but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> I think in the en
we buy some things on our sid
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay [lah] why not <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk</malay> exchange <malay>hantaran</malay
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
(uh) the equipment that include all the (err) the <malay>kompang</malay> and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so <malay>kita kena tengok macam mana</malay> [lah] [kan] so is lik
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
<malay>orang melayu kita ni</malay> actually (err) come with a lot of (err) <malay>gotong royong</malay> even though <malay>kita tak sekampung</malay> [lah] not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like <malay>macam pinjamkan kereta</malay> you know so when if you no
(err) how to say #farah# see you just like okay [lah] whatever people (uh) rent you okay [lah] something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like <malay>macam</malay
(uh) certain relative got this car whatever they say [eh] I #chope# your car <malay>dulu</malay> for the coming wedding can or not just ask [lah
you know or maybe like <malay>dekat dekat</malay> wedding <malay>tu</malay> you ask becaus
(uh) <malay>dulu</malay> I in this case usually [lah] people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
(uh) we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar [lah] [pe] [seh] joke [ah] I'm not racist [tau] but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing [lah] so it was just like <malay>kita</malay> like just focu
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
<malay>ataupun</malay> early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out <malay>agak agak</malay> because by that time you [dah] start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly <malay>berapa</malay> one month <malay>berapa dapat</malay> sav
so basically you can <malay>agak agak</malay> already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one [ah
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
this one take time [lah] but again (uh) I think #hairin# (uh) or or #hairin# [lah] <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] (uh) maybe is t
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because (uh) you <malay>ini</malay> [kan] actually <malay>masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>yang mereka</malay> seems like okay okay <malay>tapi tak</malay> okay <malay>kot</malay
ya <malay>memang</malay> [lah] (um) to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like <malay>macam secara</malay> positive ya so at least that <malay>macam</malay> you know what you can (um) do best within this (err
(uh) constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it [lah] so let's talk about happy things [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stress [jer] <malay>cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita</malay> happy <malay>pulak dalam pasal pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ni</malay
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okay actually that time you got share with me [kan] <malay>tentang mak andam</malay> like quality of <malay>mak andam</malay
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
ya okay <malay>macam itu kira</malay> not too bad [lah] [kan] because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like <malay>macam</malay> prepare and then both both parents are okay [ah] it's just anyway you also have time also <malay>nak</malay> save money you kno
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because (um) certain country [dah] already open [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> you can just like chill relax [lah] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam nak fikir fikir sangat</malay> [kan] then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house [ah] that's another advantage [lah
[ah] <malay>ini pun</malay> if let's say both side okay [lah] I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like <malay>kita macam</malay> like okay [jer] like <malay>nikah</malay> is that correc
[oh] I think that part can't be helped right we all <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam</malay> happy happ
know you are like can can just like (uh) <malay>kita sama sama</malay> you know <malay>ramai ramai meraikan</malay> !chey! <malay>macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>saja mengeratkan silaturahim</malay> so I think can [lah] I think we jus
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
[ah] but now I think for now don't take it as (uh) <malay>macam sedih nak kahwin</malay> [kan] you just more like if all the all the (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time [lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both <malay>kena bincang</malay
<malay>sebaiknya</malay> like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month <malay>macam kena ada</malay> like your own goals [lah] but if let's say if both of you like very <malay>nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want <malay>nak buat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>biarlah</malay> you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
(um) to prioritise [lah] then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say family <malay>kata</malay> [oh] no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit [lah] [ah] okay option one I let go the fla
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
[ah] that's another option [lah] that means to get a resale flat maybe <malay>dalam</malay> three five years that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know our relativ
some of them <malay>ada</malay> so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like (uh) just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you know [ah] <malay>sendiri sendiri yang macam nak</malay> spend [lah] so if let's say if this side <malay>kata</malay> okay <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
[ah] then okay then so <malay>semua boleh</malay> centralised <malay>atau pun nak</malay> separate <malay>itu</malay> another one [lah] [ah] because I thin
about <malay>tunang</malay> he can never be meet everywhere [lah] [kan] like <malay>macam semua</malay> happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam boleh</malay
then okay [loh] <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> [oh] too bad [lah] because (um) either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
for you to (uh) come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor [lah] okay then if there's an option two that both parties <malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] why not we bought (uh) you know <malay>yang</malay
norms [lah] <malay>sederhana</malay> [jer] like very minimal number of (um) (err) what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it [lah] finish okay [dah] <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> [lah] that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like <malay>macam tahu</malay> okay <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount <malay>kita ada ni kita boleh</malay> prepare <malay>macam ini</malay> [ah] then [ah
<malay>orang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang mampu macam ini</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan] like it's like you know we can't be #bo# #chap# in everything <malay>sebab</malay> we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that (err) you <malay>apa ni</malay
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) for you both all you want is just <malay>nikah</malay> maybe take beautiful pictures go (err) nice honeymoon then [dah] <malay>habis</malay> then after that focus <malay>kat rumah</malay
[oh] okay okay <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is (err) more important than <malay>hantaran hantaran</malay> is culture <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is <malay>agama</malay
[ah] so <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is part of the (err) <malay>macam dalam dalam</malay> term <malay>dia dalam</malay> arab is called <malay>maha</malay
so <malay>maha</malay> is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount <malay>yang kita dapat tu</malay> minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken <malay>yang kasi</malay> the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
[ah] you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which <malay>negeri</malay> ya <malay>dia orang lagi</malay> emphasise <malay>mas kahwin</malay> then a gift gift <malay>tu hantaran</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi dia orang</malay> [ah] that is culture <malay>melayu kita ni terbalik</malay> [ah
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] gift <malay>tu lebih</malay> high <malay>daripada mas kahwin</malay> but right it should be another way but I think (err) <malay>mas kahwin ke</malay
(err) <malay>hantaran</malay> (err) for me [lah] I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents <malay>cakap tak nak ambil</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way (err) sometimes <malay>rilek</malay> [jer] [lah
(err) you can have the best of both worlds [kan] <malay>jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi</malay> important [lah] [kan] [ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already [dah] <malay>pening kepala</malay> [lah] [kan] like very (um) you know so you you just got to <malay>doa</malay> for awhile <malay>rilek</malay> you know don't need to thin
(err) so in detail yet but at least to think okay now <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] you know what is among all these things <malay>yang macam</malay
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
like you can because you think things that you can control <malay>macam</malay> budget photographer your brother [ah] these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that [ah] if let's say for example [ah] we exchange (err) three <malay>saja</malay> [lah] item let's say for exampl
okay [ah] for example [a'ah] <malay>cuma satu</malay> I this one I don't know [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I should have known luckily I never [ah] exchanged <malay>quran</malay> do you know that what is i
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
like (uh) okay so <malay>jada</malay> is common <malay>tapi</malay> [seh] <malay>jada kita tahu</malay> you will be used for (um) after marriage in when we play together but when talking about <malay>quran</malay> and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you <malay>hantar al quran</malay
I don't okay y
you mean the <malay>hantaran</malay
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
[oh] <malay>duit</malay> that one that one is the <malay>mas [eh] <malay>ini</malay> not <malay>mas</malay> [kan] that one is (err) !alah! <malay>hantaran</malay> [lah] ya [lah] but some give cheque [ah] nowaday
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it [lah] ya if you ask me can be cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha
okay what righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> what but inside is PayNow [leh] is direct transfe
[ah] so is all depends [lah] but again if follow tradition ya [lah] they want to see for real to sure <malay>masih</malay> cash you know you know bank not
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but <malay>mesti</malay> there's a transaction and PayNow
if not screen shot and then you se
(mm) it happens [ah] actually happens during my time also is like [oh] because they only said [lah] when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so [ah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot <malay>tapi</malay> to know each other's partner is very very important so i
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
so I think like this (uh) family support is one factor very very important to me [lah] that's why (err) I mean culturally <malay>kita melayu</malay> is very united <malay>satu hati</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> you know [lah] we are lik
we always like (um) always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples <malay>susah</malay> even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also [lah] but the thing is like people also like <malay>sibuk</malay> and go and go and comment y
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[oh] it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that <malay>tapi</malay> out there maybe <malay>dia pakai</malay> card card card <malay>tapi tak</malay> shar
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
per per per person or individual like that like <malay>macam tak tunjuk</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay
(err) like no communication with their families feel like <malay>tak tunjuk</malay> or what [lah] ya so that can happen [tau] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak tak tak ada</malay> then why you ask me after seven years dating <malay>pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke</malay> [kan] maybe all the while the guy only show up front [oh] <malay>aku ada hadiahkan</malay> best best you kno
[ah] <malay>dia bukan pun tak tunjuk</malay> kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging [eh] <malay>macam berlakon</malay> staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating [ah] but some people ya carry on maybe like for example <malay>dia</malay> partner no [ah
the other party <malay>tu tak ada duit</malay> maybe <malay>tak</malay> you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe [lah] should be okay [lah] <malay>nanti kahwin pun</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam sekarang</malay
(um) he has so many money <malay>aku minta pun</malay> okay [jer] [ah] you know sounds like but I the end when the person say [oh] (uh) he's in debt for the wedding <malay>ini</malay> ya actually that is not the only on
I think <malay>dari zaman</malay> our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P #ramlee# sho
[ah] lie [lah] borrow the #chetty# [lah] you know that that particular #chetty# will always just borrow lend the money to them what (um) high interest and then end up <malay>hutang</malay> because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> family understand family <malay>tahu</malay> what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them !wah! very have good job then they get flat <malay>dengan</malay> with their pa
they cannot even get flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
so there's (uh) about three months is like or four months ya <malay>tak</malay> start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
that's why he told me [lah] [kan] so like <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>kelakar</malay> then I was like abby you all <malay>gaji</malay> seventy eight thousand [dah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
then like let me [oh] <malay>mampus</malay> [ah] like that like that then he said no [lah] it's just tha
(uh) you know the more th
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like (uh) like <malay>macam peribahasa melayu apa</malay> the <malay>apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
[ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] don't know [lah] there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that [lah] which I always think [oh
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
to know you usually parents [ah] whether to let go kids to <malay>kahwin</malay> I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich [lah] right no need to be like so <malay>kaya</malay> or whatever you just need to have like (um
[ah] more than enough like can start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you can pay your bills you know you can you can (uh) you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
(err) want to want to buy a normal <malay>sayur</malay> or <malay>kangkung</malay
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say [ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
(um) when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my <malay>anak</malay> when all of you come to me my <malay>anak anak saudara</malay> ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision <malay>apakah</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you <malay>nak</malay> make sure tha
you start something that with no <malay>hutang</malay> you know because basically you you start something with <malay>hutang</malay> you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know <malay>hutang</malay> [lah] [kan] you will have you got kids already <malay>hutang</malay> will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing [lah] [ah] because <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kita anak anak sultan</malay> #johor# <malay>ke</malay> daughters <malay>sultan</malay> daughters of <malay>sultan</malay> johor can [lah
[ah] then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
but the thing don't let it kill you [lah] that's why I said (err) in this case [kan] <malay>suka ke tidak</malay> instrinsic back breakdown <malay>tu kena ada</malay
[ah] introduce you must have really must have because if not [lah] if you ask me [lah] !wah! very #jialat# [lah] like every everything also must <malay>risau</malay> bu
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then (um) you can't convince your parents lik
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> convince like that <malay>macam</malay> like for example [ah] you kno
fathers [oh] <malay>mesti nak ada lima ratus</malay> okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents [ah] okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sembarang</malay> [ah] he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point <malay>apa-apa suka hati</malay> okay [lah] <malay>korang</malay> [dah] plan [kan] okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay
[ah] <malay>engkau</malay> continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin

honestly I respect those people <malay>yang macam dia orang sudah</malay> like for two years
and then doing the same thing that <malay>budak</malay> poly <malay>buat</malay> then having to go through the same thing like for another three years <malay>kat</malay> poly it's just so tiring and exhausting [ah] that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> they choose to just work
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
for me like for example [eh]
poly [kan] <malay>macam</malay> also is like poly so like I feel like <malay>macam ni</malay> poly example I take it as [eh] having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
(um) I would consider [ah] because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
it's not like <malay>macam</malay> easy you know like for those people who really like (um)
<malay>buat</malay> the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
exhausting [ah] like what I see that's why I really
salute those people who <malay>macam</malay> have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to (um) poly ya
then for me also like my results it's (um) released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also [eh] will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like (um) because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
phase is just (um) submitting your diploma ranking course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah [kan] <malay>dia dapat</malay> interview so <malay>dia</malay> pass interview and then she already get her what [ah] her results that like she can go in like like her place for
(um) pharmaceutical science <malay>memang sudah</malay> chop chop for her so macam</malay> okay [lah] she <malay>sudah selamat</malay> she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because <malay>dia memang</malay> can already it's like
so <malay>macam kalau</malay> interview <malay>sudah</malay> pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all [lah]
but for me because my interview <malay>tak dapat</malay>
so like
now focus solely on which is (uh) <malay>kita orang</malay> <malay>pasal kita orang tak ada</malay> exam also so they look
over (um) they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day <malay>macam</malay> for us [kan] <malay>ada orang</malay> like
(um) <malay>sekolah dia orang satu hari</malay> is like is combination of subjects but for me is like <malay>kalau</malay> math is
maths [jer] for that day so like after that day they will like grade us [oh] how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want [lah] of course my expectation is higher
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> there's a mixture of A and B is <malay>banyak</malay> and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like (um) three to four
<malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>kalau macam</malay> C <malay>banyak gitu</malay> then maybe around two point five to three point five <malay>gitu</malay> then (um)
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
like <malay>baru berapa</malay> compared to my other two friend I think they did more better [lah] in a sense
then
so like
(um)
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech <malay>memang nak</malay> try <malay>dapat</malay> biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like <malay>mati-mati nak</malay> biomedical science [jer] like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
it's okay
but the thing he <malay>tak</malay> put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense [lah] cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them [oh] what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure (um) and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise [kan] and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me [lah] then my daily grade from
biology also <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> A
A <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard [lah] cause it's the (um) they focus (um) on biology the most
like it's important subject [lah]
so ya (um)
then
so like this semester <malay>tak ada</malay> exam so I next semester <malay>ada</malay> exam
for sure but (um) for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable [lah]
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay <malay>pasal</malay> assignment <malay>dia pun</malay> is
<malay>tak banyak</malay> like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day [kan] like through read virtually like other then after that (um)
teacher will give us like (uh) practice questions to do
<malay>habis ada</malay> quiz <malay>juga</malay> that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
[eh] eleven five nine
then the practice question is like <malay>biasa macam</malay> homework <malay>gitu</malay>
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time (um)
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to (um) type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
mostly <malay>banyak</malay> presentation but it's good [lah]
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm (um) when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages <malay>pasal</malay> like I think you will feel like
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before (um) [eh] like when you presenting and all
then (um) for me [kan] like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
<malay>kalau</malay> I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu [kan] is just like my weakness like
whatever I say [kan] confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya (um)
ya
and then
also ya
then <malay>pasal</malay> presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [lah] but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates <malay>yang</malay>
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
ours
is different [seh] we like on that day [kan] the presentation on that day you have to [ah] prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation <malay>punya tu</malay>
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break [lah] [kan]
ya
(mm)
and it was (uh) two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
sometimes I'm like !wow! <malay>kita dah</malay> eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near (um) uniforms so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old [lah] then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> actually it's normal <malay>macam biasa</malay> like !wow! it's just normal [lah] honestly
ya
(mm)
and it's okay cause <malay>macam tak ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we don't really take that into my mind <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like <malay>keluar</malay> dates with you know I think
I don't really mind [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I have a boyfriend or not as long as <malay>macam</malay> that is like (um) <malay>kawan dekat</malay> you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me <malay>pasal</malay> later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
(mm) no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
[eh] but for her [kan] NAFA
NAFA is like [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
really
[oh]
[eh] !wow! I didn't know that
[oh] my god that's so much friends
seriously
like different people also like different [lah] honestly like (um) the things that they're prioritising and it's all like <malay>semua ada masing-masing</malay> [lah] <malay>hanya</malay>
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of worries like [oh] <malay>pasal duit</malay> and all that of course you want your family to be <malay>macam</malay> stable [lah] like in every (um) ya in everything you know
ya
it's very hard [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> family <malay>tak cannot like <malay>tak tak ada</malay> like stability and all that [kan] I feel like [ah] one day confirm will fall apart <malay>punya</malay>
for sure
and some more I also like the type of person <malay>yang tak</malay> message <malay>orang</malay>
like !wow! <malay>kalau dah malas dia punya malas</malay> is <malay>malas tak aku boleh</malay> like
for one week straight <malay>tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa</malay> cause like I'm that type of person [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !wah! like heartbreak this heartbreak <malay>gila babi</malay> you know like that kind
but then like !wah! like <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
I'm proud of myself like !wow!
but even though like there are times <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam nak ada orang</malay> like to be by your side like a boyfriend [lah] okay <malay>kirakan</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
<malay>kita boleh</malay> get over it [lah] there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
ya same
same [lah] as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see (um) every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
(um) gone
so like sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] <malay>ada</malay> family gathering [kan] it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something [ah] even my sister like
like (uh) video call her friends during [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm having a dinner so I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay [lah] <malay>kalau ada kawan tu</malay> okay but then like <malay>kalau</malay> it's time to like for your family you focus on your family [jer] <malay>tak mahu</malay> get mixed [lah] like video call with friends like
other time you can do [what] like <malay>kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang</malay> like <malay>jumpa kawan habis kat rumah</malay> also like <malay>kawan</malay> then like when are you going to like you know (um)
(mm) spend time with your family not really ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family [kan] is like
!wow! I'm lucky to be in such a family kind <malay>punya</malay> vibes cause different family different [ah] <malay>ada</malay> family like focus (um)
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future <malay>kalau nak ada family</malay> I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then <malay>kalau</malay> like my <malay>anak-anak macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke aku macam nak bagi</malay> advice <malay>sikit</malay>

#khai#

(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay okay

(mm)
he bailed
okay
ya
(hmm)
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
[oh] my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
[oh] is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract [lah]
then it's okay [ah]
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
!huh!
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really [meh] okay [lah] my first
but not admin
no pay [lah] like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he #zao#
wasted [sia]
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
[ah] I
last september
mid september I so I go home <malay>naik</malay> taxi right
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for (uh) for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of (err) end of september
the end of september
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so <malay>aku</malay> submit
<malay>aku</malay> submit like
seven or eight october
and then she say it will be in [ah] for november pay [eh] [ah] october pay [lah] but I will receive in november <malay>apa</malay>
then (uh) when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her [lah] luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said [oh] is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this [one] she just disappear
ya
I mean come on [lah] I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about (uh) our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said [oh] my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said [oh] the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking [lah]
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay [ah]
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K [what] so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine [leh]
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
so <malay>dia pun</malay>
#peng# [ah] because <malay>dia tanya macam</malay> how much you got paid [ah] then after that [ah] he said [oh]
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
#changi#
yes [ah]
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
<malay>dia</malay> she just with what just graduated from poly
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
cause she did events management so in term of <malay>macam layan</malay> customer and all she's quite good [lah] like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
so of course [lah] I understand why she is angry [lor] then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more [eh] four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four [eh] one point six [ah] one point ya ya
<malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>entah macam bila dia datang kerja</malay> right <malay>sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat</malay> ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert <malay>macam tak ada guna</malay>
<malay>aku ada cakap aku cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>suruh dia berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> manager cause confirm <malay>ada macam</malay> review <malay>apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> sometime manager <malay>aku tanya macam</malay> okay everything okay everything okay
so <malay>kalau aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> it bothers her so much
ask maybe
that one point nine is just <malay>kau punya</malay>
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know [lah] like try your luck [lah] then she said
no [lah] but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
[kan] <malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>kasi dia</malay> scenarios [sia] like some ya you try [lah] you try talk like that
[kan]
<malay>kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap pasal macam asal kita tak</malay> happy
yes cannot <malay>macam</malay> involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract [pe] and the agreement
cannot [lah] [sia] I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
<malay>dia setakat</malay> hire [jer]
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
and then she said <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia takut</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau dia berbual gini</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> manager <malay>aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan</malay> <malay>ke apa</malay> or maybe the boss confirm after this <malay>dia kena macam pulau</malay>
confirm <malay>kena pulau</malay> [kan] yes <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni budak yang minta minta</malay> higher pay
sad [sia]
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy [eh]
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission [lah] but still we are still doing our job
so it's <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
actually their their pay is is good [leh] for full timer
two point six
email [lah] I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
is not conducive at all [lah] I I I when I see them doing email <malay>macam</malay> annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email <malay>abeh</malay> you you see customer coming right
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
but this is not the case that's why when I see her <malay>macam</malay> one point nine is not enough [sia]
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay [ah]
yes and is not only that [sia]
<malay>macam</malay> it's like a chain effect
the big boss will be
the big bosses <malay>anuh</malay>
the another boss boss boss then after that go to manager then manager <malay>kena</malay> manager will go to us <malay>kena</malay>
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave [mah] I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck [ah] I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I #zao# already [lah]

I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know [lah]
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
second last day of january then why not then I <malay>kira</malay> [kan] unemployed after that ya
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
<malay>macam</malay> work with him [lah] is not work with him

so ya but he wants me to
right
he wants me to design but he wants me to come out with the brand and and take it as my brand under his wing
then I said I I said to him [lah] <malay>aku aku cakap dia terus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kau yang ada</malay> design <malay>dia</malay> [sia] <malay>kau dah ada</malay> the inspiration in mind [tau] you already have the vision

which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh) not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to <malay>macam</malay>
a bad woman [ah] basically
<malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> not all <malay>aku tak cakap yang</malay> all beautiful ladies
<malay>perempuan lawa</malay> is basically <malay>jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau katakan</malay> [eh] like ninety per cent
ninety per cent
<malay>kalau</malay> from my point of view [lah] <malay>aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi</malay> [oh] <malay>dia buat kawan aku macam gini</malay> [oh]

like my like nowadays it's more of <malay>kita</malay> judge the book by its cover [kan]
I mean you can judge a person based on <malay>dia punya</malay> personality first <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> most of the time they judge on looks
just because <malay>dia tak lawa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu</malay>
so nowadays is different [ah] from last time

<malay>macam mak ngan ayah punya</malay> time is more [ah] !wah! <malay>aku suka dia</malay> K [eh] she's the [one] for me <malay>macam gitu</malay> like
like last time people is more of a <malay>macam</malay> loyal [tau] <malay>sekarang</malay> is more of K [ah]
(mm) what you mean
ya attention <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> they need attention [ah]
because now is <malay>kita</malay> living in a modern society [tau] so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with <malay>faham</malay>
and we need to work and we need to think about this and that
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
that's why they need attention as like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) pleasure
not (uh) pleasure [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
[ah] they need attention because they are young [ah] basically
<malay>kalau</malay> married couple for me <malay>kalau nak</malay> attention is very hard [ah]
for you to get attention if both are working most of (uh) most of the adults now you see is both working [what]
ya is have to
<malay>tapi kalau nak cakap</malay> [kan] [eh] (um)
<malay>aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku</malay> attention <malay>tapi kita</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you're not [ah] giving both
both of like both of your life a chance [tau]
like
<malay>kau nak selalu cakap</malay> I need attention <malay>tapi</malay> you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things <malay>apa</malay>
that's why you're married because you trust each other
<malay>kau faham tak aku cakap</malay>
is it
no [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> piece together all of it [kan] is <malay>susah juga pasal</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> is more like <malay>kita</malay> have different thoughts different feelings <malay>kita punya</malay> emotions all jumble up
basically
<malay>jadi kita</malay> [ah]
and singapore [eh] <malay>kalau kau nak tahu</malay> [eh] singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world [tau] serious
because of the stress that <malay>macam kita</malay> put on ourselves just to survive every month
that is quite harsh [lah] harsh reality [ah]
and singapore [eh] have the <malay>macam</malay> the highest divorce rate
one of the highest [ah] divorce rate in the world
mostly <malay>melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's very hard [lah] because nowadays more of like <malay>dia orang</malay> (um)
they never think
<malay>dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan</malay> [tau]
they <malay>fikir</malay> okay <malay>macam orang putih cakap</malay> yolo [eh]
you only live once [kan] so they never think <malay>macam</malay> [ah] beyond horizon [tau]
<malay>dorang just fikir</malay> okay (uh) <malay>aku nak</malay> party [ah] all the way but <malay>dia nak kena fikir juga</malay>
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going <malay>macam</malay> downhill [ah]
[kan]
so <malay>pada aku</malay> wise [eh] <malay>nak cakap sekarang punya zaman</malay> is more stress [lah] basically
<malay>tapi yang penting</malay> [eh] <malay>daripada</malay> drama <malay>boleh pergi</malay> marriage
[ah] yes [oh] [ah] yes
I mean like is like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) a playhouse [tau]
[ah]
<malay>abeh kau boleh buat apa-apa kau nak</malay>
without [ah] without [ah]
without any mistakes [ah] [kan] like
<malay>kau boleh buat</malay> mistake <malay>tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi</malay> it's (uh) it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse [kan]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>aku ada tu aku ada tu</malay> thought [tau] [eh] what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I <malay>apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [oh] but it's not going to happen [ah] it's just that <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> thought [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>macam kau</malay> face reality [ah] basically <malay>susah gila</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang pun</malay>
<malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> drama
drama is okay <malay>cakap-cakap</malay> scripted [kan]
<malay>tapi aku lebih suka macam</malay> reality show
<malay>kau suka</malay> variety show variety show is most likely <malay>buat macam</malay> games talkshow <malay>api aku lebih suka macam aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok shark tank</malay>

[ah] one of them can sponsor you two of them can sponsor <malay>jadi</malay> it depends [ah] on idea <malay>bagus tak</malay>

your appetite is just lost
but other than that (um)
(uh) this is why we have to (um) always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango (um)
(um) keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like (um) you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and (um)
other than that (uh)

I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad [lah] because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate [lah] she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
yeah but then like my other friends they <malay> banyak kena campak dekat (err) company <malay> yang tak related to aviation <malay> macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
but they still get they still get paid like high salary [ah] like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like !wah! so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship [lah] because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope [lah] between the project and the job
<malay> belum susah cause <malay> aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job [kan] <malay> tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard [lah] I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the #changi# airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
no who enjoy [seh]
why
for long [ah]
what !aiyo!
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but !wah! this semester my grades okay [lah] decent only [lah] its not the grade that I expected
yeah because because like I said [lah] like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya [lah] a bit <malay> takut [ah] when if you talk then you will talk alone
so how (err) how was
good [lah] was it a <malay> macam manageable or stressful
okay [lah] but it's quite hard [lah] to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct [lah] better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
[oh]
same [lah] I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me [lah] you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID (err) finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up (err) finance or course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal [lah] that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
<malay> abih kau macam mana macam ada plans <malay> nak buat business [eh]
!wah!
I see like !wah! nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
<malay>tak</malay> they see [eh] I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers [lah]
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes [oh] now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
[oh] muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have (err) thoughts [lah] like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like (err) nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have (err) it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small [one] [lah] then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults [lah] those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
just like the other cafes <malay> semua those that sell the mains all yeah
yeah true [lah]
<malay> sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere <malay>ulu</malay> somewhere (err) a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the <malay>ulu</malay> places right then people want to
like (err) it will be inconvenience for them [lah] you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport [lah] like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard [lah] even if you take a bus or you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
and cannot be <malay>ulu</malay> [lah] like I said
but I feel I feel like (err) cafes in the west is like
quite boring [ah]
like I said
[oh]
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people

then it was actually <malay>azan</malay> [ah] [ah] three
three <malay>azan</malay> I don't know <malay>azan buat</malay> [lah] <malay>terkejut</malay> I also don't know [lah]
ya three [ah] <malay>azan</malay> then I was like <malay>azan</malay> [eh] then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real [ah] if there is a <malay>kampung</malay> beside [lah]
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask #nos# [eh] #nos# beside <malay>yang tempat</malay> we <malay>pancing</malay> got <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] then <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] then I was like
[oh] <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan</malay>
I heard <malay>ada macam ada orang tengah azan</malay> and I I stood there for quite some time [lah] just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly [lah] [eh] <malay>kau tak bilang</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>kau tak kejut aku</malay> then I was like <malay>apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ</malay>
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there [ah] this [one] was #han# #han# and the rest went I I didn't went there
so he was like (um) <malay>tertidur</malay>
then he tried to sleep you know [ah] he always try to sleep when he <malay>pancing</malay> [one] then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then <malay>dia pusing pusing pusing</malay> then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree [lah] <malay>kat tengah-tengah</malay> in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree [lah] then he saw one <malay>nenek</malay> one <malay>nenek</malay>
walk pass then he was like [ah] the <malay>nenek</malay> told him like #cu# #cu# <malay>dah tahu sini tempat keras</malay> [kan] <malay>asal malap</malay> [jer] <malay>di tempat</malay> you [eh] <malay>macam tempat</malay> you <malay>pula</malay> [eh] no no no not that
why why (um) <malay>malap</malay> [jer] <malay>tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap</malay> like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight [lah] but that day he just never on it [lah] then
#han# already know [lah] he he got experience before then after that he knows that this [one] is
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> this [one] is mystics [lah] like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
(um) like [oh] (err) then he just keep quiet [lah]
keep quiet then #rilek-rilek# then the <malay>nenek</malay> (um) turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that [lah]
then he he knows already [lah] then he just stay awake [lah] then the next day the driver came [ah] came to pick them up
then the driver say got one time he was passing by [ah] at night [ah] then he actually saw at the <malay>pokok</malay> there <malay>ada</malay> (err) <malay>pocong</malay> [ah] <malay>tengah</malay>
so it it means that like that <malay>nenek</malay> come to actually warn them that that place very <malay>malap</malay> then got other stuff also [lah] then that that <malay>nenek</malay> just go there to warn them [lah] like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice [lah] but it's just <malay>malam</malay> ya <malay>malam kena jaga-jaga</malay> ya
that that particular
(mm)
(mm)
but it's not from malaysia [lah] [oh] so they they hear all over
so loud
(mm)
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic [ah]
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this [one] is where the driver will drive [eh] drive then this is an open area <malay>di sini ada satu pokok</malay> in the middle
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
path [ah] actually the right path also can you will see <malay>pulut ketam</malay> in front of you that stretch like that [ah] towards the tip [lah] you can see the whole tip of #pulau ketam#
[ah] I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we [ah] ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move !alamak!
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out [lah] !huh!
[lah] [kan] [eh]
then your past few days <malay>macam mana</malay> your past few months [ah] [ah] the time the last
time I met you then you say you just <malay>berhenti kerja</malay> [pe] you just stop work
(mm)
(mm)
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
so <malay>apa</malay> you you apply mostly what type of <malay>apa</malay> industry
what phone call [eh] <malay>kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau</malay> english all the way [eh] have you never notice beginning
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then (err)
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the <malay>cerita</malay> so <malay>kau dah</malay> apply <malay>kerja habis semua tak dapat</malay> [ah] all all rejected you
ya [lah]
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central (err) [ah] ya
(mm)
within the week
within the month
ya
ya [lah]
<malay>sakit hati</malay> [ah]
surrounding surrounding
surrounding have a few other <malay>masjid</malay> in the east
[ah] okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
[ah]
so what you did you tell anyone no [ah]
but but whose that middle person
(mm)
then different different person
(mm)
#fandi ahmad#
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's why [lah] is
no [lah] I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
you will need to come in and explain to them [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] this the way the reason why I <malay>letak</malay> the moderator first then followed by the asatizah</malay> then followed by (err) #fandi ahmad# is because
(um) according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever (uh) I know that first <malay>kau kena letak</malay> the moderator first
why why why the moderator first <malay>pasal dia yang akan</malay> moderate everything then followed by the <malay>asatizah</malay> who are
who will be the one main speakers [ah] who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then #fandi ahmad# at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that [lah]
[ah]
game [lah]
(mm)
a caricature [lah]
no [lah] to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of <malay>macam situasi</malay> [lah]
(mm)
but this is but this [one] is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help [ah]
ya
ya that's why [lah] that's not like you said [lah] is <malay>tak</malay> professional [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm) ya is a
of course is the comic [lah] because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group <malay>akan dibawa naikkan</malay> to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that <malay>dalam kamu punya</malay> age group [lah] so it's better for you in that sense [ah]
[ah]
yes
ya
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera <malay>dah berapa mahal</malay> then (err) the time you took to edit I actually
<malay>pernah</malay> I <malay>pernah</malay> help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge [ah] <malay>tentang</malay> video [ah] the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship [lah] then after that then <malay>apa tu</malay> the thing is
<malay>kenapa tak ada</malay> any background in Photoshop <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so <malay>nak</malay> edit <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> edit so I ask you for help that time
then after that then the way I see you edit [ah] !aduh! is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that [one] was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was <malay>tak susah</malay> because <malay>tak banyak</malay> animation <malay>tak banyak</malay> at that time [lah] it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence <malay>itu pun dah boleh jadi gila</malay>
then ya I understand because as a programmer <malay>nanti</malay> I do some programs <malay>ke apa</malay> and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later <malay>dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti</malay> [eh] #hakim# (um) actually the client <malay>tak suka</malay> (uh) this part of the game [ah] can change it then <malay>dalam hati aku macam</malay> what it took me hours to get that part working
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research <malay>tengok</malay> whether <malay>apa tu apa yang</malay> client <malay>tu nak</malay> is feasible <malay>tak</malay> can it be included
into the program itself <malay>macam</malay> the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so [oh] <malay>sakit</malay>
definitely [lah]
[eh] feelings feelings
say goodbye
<malay>dengar cerita</malay>
true story actually <malay>sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap</malay>
#sulaiman#
no [lah] is is just <malay>pelik</malay> [lah]
tolong</malay>
<malay>malam jumaat</malay>
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
[oh]
<malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek</malay>
(err) podcast
you know the back to the story <malay>sikit</malay> right just now I talk about my intern so my intern [kan] I was being paid (err) one thousand dollars
per month ya
[eh] #rilek# [ah] #rilek# [ah] <malay>dengar dulu</malay> but but the thing is the time (err) I'm from
so <malay>bila kita</malay> (um) want to sign up for <malay>apa tu</malay> for internship you need to go through this website [ah] I forgot what's the website [oh] my <malay>apa</malay> website <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] website <malay>tu ada ada</malay> [lah] <malay>masih situ</malay> [ah]
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to <malay>gaji</malay> so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over [ah] fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through <malay>gaji</malay> like which one is higher pay [lah]
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address [lah] the address of the company then after that then I was like okay [lah] at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two [lah]
then I went in then I went in #rilek-rilek# talk with my colleagues then got other interns <malay>juga situ</malay> they are leaving already
then I was like [eh] your <malay>gaji berapa</malay> [ah] how much <malay>kau dapat</malay> every month one thousand !huh! [eh] one thousand <malay>sikitnya</malay>
!wah! <malay>sikitnya</malay> one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like [oh] according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know [lah] but
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two [lah] [eh] cannot be [what] no there's no there was it's just allowance
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like <malay>apa hal ni</malay>
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and [eh] boss (uh) can ask you something [ah] yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask [ah] the the allowance
is one thousand [ah] because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand [ah]
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
<malay>malas</malay> you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay [ah] once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay [lah] <malay>rezeki di mana-mana</malay>
no you will say can <malay>boleh macam mana</malay> [oh] you need to sign up this you need to do that [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay>
I give it to you
typical malay [ah]
!aduh!
<malay>kau nak doa lapan minit kau pergi doa</malay>
actually I so
just asking [ah] I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple [lah] keep it simple
#mat-mat# #mat-mat# [ah]
nothing [lah] it's nothing nothing much
[ah] so little bit [lah] just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school [lah] [ah] [oh] ya talking about
Grab [lah] last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see <malay>macam dia punya</malay> timeline [ah] like what do you
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
<malay>kau cakap kau nak kerja</malay> Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo [oh] <malay>betul</malay> [eh] <malay>jauh</malay>
because I I myself also got (um) work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is [ah] the pay to me is I tell you [lah] it's quite it's quite [ah] quite decent for I would say (err) part time [lah] because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get [lah] so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
if you if you hustle even more <malay>macam</malay> hustle <malay>demi</malay> hustle [jer] is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that [one] is motor [lah] but ya [lah] but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you really can't get anything because <malay>apa tu</malay> okay [lah] I got learn some finance also [lah] [kan] you should know [lah] so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in [lah] rather than just <malay>duit terkeluar duit terkeluar</malay> then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the <malay>rezeki belum masuk lagi</malay> in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders [ah] per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
take off like okay [ah] <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat</malay> [ah] I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
a good place for you to like start [lah] then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
from your house <malay>sini jalan kaki</malay> #punggol# #sengkang# further [eh] macritchie further
<malay>mana</malay> [seh]
marina barrage

marina got what marina bay sands
<malay>kenapa tu kenapa ada</malay> kick <malay>tu</malay> how long

so fast then why why when we
<malay>dulu</malay> twenty four click take so long
maybe maybe we I should I should start with you [ah] what nine five five
<malay>macam</malay> might as well [lah] I park my motor somewhere
five five eight

okay <malay>abang</malay> so how our renovation plans
<malay>hari raya</malay> !wah! you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> yet
it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay>
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot [ah] too risky
okay
why are we talking about <malay>hari raya</malay>
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
(uh) how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but (uh)
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
so <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> (um)
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> Popular I <malay>beli</malay> cardboard
I <malay>beli kertas yang keras tu</malay> then (uh) I
<malay>cari gambar nanti</malay> I print
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>cetak</malay> <malay>nanti</malay> I print <malay>lepas tu nanti boleh tampal</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> cardboard <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> designer <malay>itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita</malay> just (um)
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>baca-baca</malay> [jer] <malay>tak tahu betul ke tak ke</malay> [kan]
<malay>buat lawak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada maksudnya</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang</malay> company (err) company <malay>itu nak apa nak</malay>
<malay>tunjuk kita nak bagi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>jadi kita</malay> just
<malay>kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> mood board <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>hari itu</malay> I <malay>dah tunjuk</malay> you <malay>gambar dekat</malay> WhatsApp <malay>dah tengok belum</malay>
WhatsApp
[ha] ya [lah] <malay>habis</malay> group <malay>mana</malay>
<malay>dah tengok</malay>
<malay>corak</malay> [oh] okay [ah] if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
you know like the english one the not contemporary [ah] english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
<malay>betul juga</malay> (uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu</malay>
<malay>orang yang</malay> (uh) <malay>cucikan</malay> sofa
<malay>sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu</malay> actually <malay>dari daripada minyak masak</malay>
(uh) (uh) [lah] okay [lah] then I I have to agree with you [lah] we go we put the partition that means
[eh] ya [lah] correct [lah] when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like (um)
[ah] like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
!chey! private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt [lah] all that [lah] so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny [ah]
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like (uh)
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
(mm)
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
(uh) mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
(uh) or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
<malay>lepas itu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat</malay> (uh) platform <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>yang yang dulu</malay> actually <malay>nak buat</malay> #musollah# <malay>lepas itu tak jadi</malay>
<malay>sebenarnya bukan nak</malay> hack <malay>nak nak buang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang lama punya</malay> platform <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> platform <malay>itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput</malay>
<malay>tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput</malay> [lah] <malay>itu dah nak</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu bawah</malay> platform <malay>itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak</malay>
<malay>mungkin sarang labah-labah sarang semut tapi sarang semut tu makanan</malay>
(mm)
[eh] but the other day I went through (um) this hard zone or something [lah] the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across (uh) this person
(uh) he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else [lah] then it's already two K
just the platform
(uh huh) <malay>buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas itu nanti dah ada</malay>
<malay>letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dan kalau ada</malay> budget then <malay>baru boleh tambah</malay> platform
(mm)
okay <malay>tak apa itu nanti</malay>
I put (uh) under
(uh) extra budget column
in the planning [lah] so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then [ah] the service balcony you know the
the doorway (um) between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills (uh) window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it [what] so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay [ah]
that [one] I that [one] that idea came from <malay>tak</malay> I <malay>nampak hari itu</malay> my friend <malay>dia tengah buat</malay> renovation <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu dia</malay> upload <malay>dekat</malay> (uh) story

<malay>pakai sama apa itu</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia dia yang dia yang</malay> I <malay>nampak daripada</malay> story <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia pakai</malay> glass <malay>itu kalau tidak</malay> I <malay>pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> replace that that <malay>tingkap dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan apa</malay> so idea <malay>dia datang itu</malay> [lah] I <malay>ternampak</malay> story my friend

actually not bad [leh] you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that (uh) different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
!wah! I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
(uh) came to real life you know really [eh] so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like (uh) extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this [one] is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
[ah]
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else [oh] ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
(err) like the window grill I don't know
so but then that [one] I haven't research (uh)
<malay>abang</malay> you <malay>boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada</malay> you <malay>tolong</malay> scolding [kan] <malay>ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah</malay> I
I [kan] <malay>tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>tingkap cantik</malay>
<malay>dia satu yang dia pakai yang</malay> (uh) <malay>sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya</malay> (uh) <malay>yang macam ketat</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketat punya macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>yang ada yang ada</malay> handle [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi cantik dia macam</malay> simple <malay>saja tapi cantik</malay>
<malay>tapi masalahnya sekarang</malay> sliding <malay>pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tingkap</malay> okay actually <malay>dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari</malay> supplier <malay>sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah</malay> already <malay>yang</malay> [kan] <malay>sudah</malay>
but (uh) ya
I think I think it's because [ah] it's already old [lah] that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not [what] it's supposed to be tight [what] like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the (uh) the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this [one] capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical (uh) wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya [lah] that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
<malay>dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat</malay> [tau] <malay>dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja</malay> I <malay>bila kat dapur baru bunyi</malay>
<malay>sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar</malay> you <malay>tak bunuh dia sebab itu</malay> I <malay>cakap kena panggil</malay>
<malay>orang itu yang tangkap tangkap cicak itu</malay>
<malay>ini sesi mengadu nasib ke</malay>
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot [lah] I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already is
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia [lah] because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
(uh) recipients
[eh] but [eh] but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back !yay! belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house [ah] you watch the host [ah] hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
[eh] but the new season (uh) the other day I was (uh) randomly (uh) looking for right
and then I saw (uh) one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
(um) the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was [ah] what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this [one] this time round is this company !aiya! I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually (uh) watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this [ah] if not actually (uh) three D innovation is good [leh]
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
(uh) what do you call that low income families [eh]
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them [ah] because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget [lah] maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what [ah] you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper [lah] okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back (uh)
[oh] we didn't even say anything but he himself say that (uh) we we call
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like <malay>merajuk</malay>
you <malay>tahu macam merajuk perempuan</malay> [ah] okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] bye bye
emotional [ah] uncle <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak boleh lupa</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay>
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years [eh] the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the (uh) what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that [one]
okay whatever you call it [ah] ya that [one] also some already (uh) like (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman [seh] to install our this [one] the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only [lah] that [one] okay [lah] but even so (uh) remember the
the also not proper
hollow [eh]
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask [what] we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
(uh) and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to #hafari# right
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already <malay>merepek</malay> right
then [ah] then after that (mm)
either that or he know that he never do correctly [lah] he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable [what] right because ya it's a expensive tile
maybe [lah] he want to save that way or what !alamak! then I regret [seh] <malay>sekarang menyesal</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pakai</malay> tiles <malay>yang kita pilih</malay>
<malay>dah bersusah payah kita pergi</malay> #hafari# <malay>lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi</malay> ya [kan] <malay>saja</malay>
(mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak licin tak jatuh</malay>
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope [lah] we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet (uh) already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever <malay>pun</malay> so
they give us a quote at least we know (uh) like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the (uh) is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
<malay>habis</malay> (uh) <malay>nak kena</malay> plan <malay>nak kena</malay>
plan <malay>itu lagi</malay> budget <malay>lagi nak kena</malay> plan budget <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> I <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>buatkan</malay> breakdown
[kan] so <malay>kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa</malay> [kan] toilet <malay>pun kita baru buat cuma</malay> maybe <malay>kalau</malay> tiles <malay>itu memang</malay>
<malay>tak bagus itu tukar saja</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> slope <malay>pun ingat tak kita</malay> [kan] <malay>suruh dia buat</malay> slope <malay>jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi</malay>
<malay>pun masih bertakung</malay> [tau] I <malay>cuci</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya</malay> slope <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>tapi yang macam</malay> accessories <malay>macam tempat mandi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu picit-picit nak cebok</malay> [ah] <malay>tu semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>boleh pakai balik</malay> [ah] so at least <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost <malay>sebab itu pun</malay> under <malay>dalam</malay> quotation <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost [lah] <malay>lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ada</malay> budget <malay>untuk buat yang rumah punya pun</malay> actually <malay>perabot tak payah cuma kita</malay> just <malay>ambil gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada</malay>
<malay>tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun</malay> considered
(uh) <malay>apa itu macam</malay> modern <malay>apa</malay> modern minimalist <malay>pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang sikit</malay> [lah]
(mm) modern <malay>juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak</malay> (mm)
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah tukar</malay> [eh]
so far <malay>yang kat dalam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> ya [lah] [kan] <malay>lampu</malay> (uh) ya so hopefully
hopefully that [one] will reduce the cost [ah] cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist (uh) off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have [ah] that [one] already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
(mm) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay> plan <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>ini tak</malay> standard plan is one (uh) kitchen two toilet
[ah]
[ah] package ya two standard
<malay>sebab itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak buat</malay> kitchen <malay>saja ini susah memang dia</malay> comes together so might as well <malay>buat saja</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit</malay> you <malay>tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga</malay> K <malay>habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit</malay> then end up <malay>kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kita betul-betul buat sekaligus</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi pun</malay> toilet
<malay>lagi pun</malay> (uh) <malay>bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah</malay> [kan] <malay>habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu</malay> [ah]
[eh] <malay>sekali terus habuk semua</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>lagi bilik bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun</malay>
(mm) <malay>bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang</malay> vinyl vinyl <malay>sahaja</malay>
<malay>dah berapa</malay> (uh) that time eight hundred [kan] <malay>lapan ratus</malay> vinyl <malay>sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini</malay>
[oh] double
[ah]
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if (uh) whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same (uh) the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need (uh)
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own (uh) contractor for the vinyl right
[ah] when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
[ah]
<malay>kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu semua nak kena</malay>
(mm) <malay>kalau kita buat balik</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena</malay> <malay>nak kena</malay>
hack <malay>nak kena</malay> plaster <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>semua akan</malay> affected
<malay>tapi ini</malay> click function [kan] vinyl <malay>itu</malay> remember
ya it is the newest click function that [one] right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own [one] but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ini ini kena potong kena apa kena</malay> measure <malay>sembarang saja</malay>
<malay>entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi</malay> [ha]
[ha]
<malay>entah tengok itu cacat</malay>
<malay>tak boleh dah haus</malay> you <malay>tengok dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya tengok ini dah</malay> <malay>hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada</malay> gap [lah] <malay>dia dah ada jarang-jarang</malay> in between <malay>dia punya ini kayu</malay>
[ah]
then how how because vinyl <malay>pun boleh kembang ikut</malay> (uh) <malay>panas atau sejuk</malay> [tau] <malay>bilik</malay>
[ah] <malay>dalam bertahun</malay> [ah] <malay>ini ini pun macam tak tukar</malay> [ha] <malay>ini dah kembang</malay> [lah] <malay>ini nampak</malay> line <malay>dia ada</malay> gap
<malay>lepas itu tak boleh ada</malay> gap <malay>itu</malay> hit <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah ini merekah</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in (uh) kids room
[oh]
ya
(uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>ini tak bagus ini</malay> I think <malay>murah punya ini bukan yang</malay> vinyl [tau] <malay>ini yang</malay>
<malay>murah punya sebab itu dia kena air dah menggelembung</malay>
[eh] (mm)
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company (uh) he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give [what] remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
(mm)
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that [one] cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know (uh) overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that [one] also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is (uh) I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean [eh] you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
(hmm)
vinyl
(mm)
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this [one] remember this [one] got two option we this [one] is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move [one] without lesser groove
ya
maybe that [one] cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser [ah] grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
(mm)
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop (uh) water sucking mop [what]
that [one] that [one] you won't go into the groove
ya [lah] it suck water the mop suck water right
[ah]
okay water absorbing mop
[oh]
[oh] that [one]
that [one] very expensive that [one] is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but [ah] make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous [eh] that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
<malay>dia orang pandai</malay> [kan] [eh]
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old (uh) [oh] now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M [one] but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
!huh! difficult have [what]
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home [one] you go and find no
only that brush [sial] no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
[ah]
okay so (uh) actually [oh] I forgot to tell you I (uh) I sign up through Renopedia
and then (um) through there there will be contacting me [ah] like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even (uh) ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection [lah] so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us [lah] through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia [what] right
so is all go back to our own research [ah]
actually they say (um) doesn't mean the very the company [eh] very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the (uh) company but I must also research (uh) and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
[ah] hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then (uh) also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then (err)
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go (uh) down and (uh) have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give [lah]
ya (uh) but I haven't show you then I I even I even (uh) wrote down their names the
(uh)
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
[oh] ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down [what]
(mm)
it must be a balance [ah] we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
[ah] to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

virtually which is so weird
I think through calls or [ah]
<malay>tak nak aku</malay> I'm not I'm not in school to do that
<malay>aku pun aku</malay> zoom <malay>sekali</malay> [jer]
for doctor's appointment
<malay>sekali</malay> [jer]
<malay>untuk apa</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> insurance <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>ada</malay> rider
no ride rider means it's an extra premium <malay>jadi kau boleh dapat macam</malay>
(um) that is a (um) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>nak cakap kau boleh</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> [kan]
opt to go for private
private hospital <malay>macam</malay> hospital <malay>aku</malay>
and there is a chance that you would not need to pay anything upfront
ya but it's still <malay>macam</malay> subject to approval [ah]
but insurance <malay>kau kau dapat bila</malay>
so shouldn't be a but it's not a pre existing condition <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
two thousand fourteen <malay>kira lepas kau kahwin baru ada</malay> insurance
[oh] before <malay>asal kau tak ambil</malay> rider <malay>sekali</malay>
recently <malay>aku</malay> check <malay>untuk siapa si</malay>
<malay>siapa ni dayah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia ada</malay> rider <malay>anak dia ada</malay> rider just <malay>anak bongsu dia takde</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
if you pay extra [lah]
[kan] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but maybe it might be some <malay>aku</malay> can check [lah] what is your
do do you know whether your prudential is
what is the
is [ah] policy name
ya I know it's shield something <malay>aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia</malay>
the PRUShield then there is this like code
<malay>kat belakang</malay>
the words <malay>juga</malay>
[kan] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] is healthshield gold max A then there is also gold max B
[ah] A <malay>paling tinggi</malay> B <malay>macam</malay> down [ah]
<malay>kalau kau boleh</malay> check
I mean you can always ask [lah] bcause sometimes a lot of <malay>banyak orang</malay> [kan] <malay>kat kerja aku bila aku buat dia orang punya</malay> how to say [ah]
(um)
admissions [ah] when I do the admissions
<malay>banyak anak</malay> [seh] <malay>tak tahu mak bapa dia orang punya</malay> insurance <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] I'll ask your parents got insurance
[oh] I don't know I don't know <malay>semua kau tak tahu apa yang kau tahu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> these kind of things especially <malay>mak bapa kau dah tua</malay>
like you wouldn't want them to just be with medishield
then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[ah] that is for disabilities
[oh]
[ah] these all these okay [eh] eldershield careshield or medishield all these [eh] is from government
<malay>apa yang kau bayar untuk</malay> insurance <malay>macam kalau</malay> let's say [ah] the basic [ah] is medishield then <malay>kalau kau</malay> upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take [ah] your prushield
prudential aviva
sometimes even but these four are the main ones [lah]
then <malay>kalau tak</malay> upgrade <malay>baru kau tahu</malay> but then <malay>bila kau</malay> upgrade poly <malay>kau nak kena tahu</malay> whether <malay>kau punya</malay> is
<malay>atas atau</malay> somewhere in between <malay>macam</malay> parents <malay>aku punya</malay> is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic [ah] but it's there so <malay>macam</malay>
like <malay>dia orang kalau pergi</malay> private [eh] so <malay>kira macam</malay> emergency <malay>dia orang kena pergi</malay> private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement [ah] so that's why <malay>aku selalu cakap dengan</malay> members members [eh]
<malay>kau orang muda kau orang boleh</malay> afford it why not
<malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar</malay>
but
yearly <malay>kau bayar berapa</malay> when you count
<malay>macam kau</malay> even it out for twelve months
it's <malay>sikit</malay> [seh] it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars [ah] then
<malay>tu baru</malay>
quite high [ah]
TAQWA
TAQWA <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>itu apa</malay> islamic <malay>punya apa</malay>
!huh!
[oh]
!aiyo!
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan]
hospital may not recognise [tau]
it may be reimbursement
<malay>asal</malay> hospital <malay>aku takde</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] no
<malay>pasal</malay> I mean
for now [ah] private hospitals they only recognise
prudential aviva so <malay>ni empat</malay> [jer] [tau] most probably <malay>kalau</malay> #ah qing# were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is [lah] <malay>macam dia dapat</malay> refund <malay>balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
these four companies are the only companies that
<malay>kita boleh</malay> try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means <malay>kau tak payah bayar</malay> upfront
so so
<malay>tu pasal tu</malay>
government is different
[ah] [ah] because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether <malay>kau</malay> private <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
private <malay>atau</malay> government for your future baby
[oh] okay [lah] government you don't have to worry <malay>macam kawan aku zahirah</malay>
give birth to #aisyah#
three K <malay>dia keluar</malay> cash money
private but after subsidiary [lah] because parkway has this
<malay>aku rasa</malay> they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
[ah] because they <malay>menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan</malay> baby <malay>dan</malay> breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that [seh] they will get <malay>dia sampai dapat apa tu</malay> nursing
breastfeeding nurse
ya they no a nurse will come and teach her how to breastfeed
like if the baby doesn't latch on then <malay>dia cakap</malay> okay you try this you try that
<malay>terus aku macam</malay>
what
but <malay>tapi bayar</malay> [lah]
but
[oh] that time <malay>kakak ipar aku punya tak</malay> [seh]
with eva
eva <malay>tak</malay> [seh]
maybe
it's a recent recent thing [ah] because when eva was there [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal dia nak</malay> compete <malay>dengan</malay> private <malay>banyak orang pergi</malay> private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele <malay>macam zahirah punya kakak ipar</malay>
she she was pregnant I think
she was like [oh] <malay>aku tak datang</malay> period
then
that time <malay>dia pergi</malay> hospital <malay>dia macam</malay> okay this is my (err)
<malay>macam</malay> [oh] I already have two kids I should be okay <malay>pergi</malay> then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] you have a mass
<malay>macam</malay> a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so <malay>dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi</malay> doctor #aziz#
pregnant [ah] [sia] member
ya it's not a mass it's a baby
[ah] wanted to say [oh] we need to bring you for surgery
<malay>dia orang</malay> ultrasound [ah] that's why <malay>tu pasal dia macam</malay> okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and <malay>anak dia semua</malay> doctor #aziz#
[ah] [ah]
end up
this doctor #aziz# apparently <malay>ada berapa sebelas anak</malay>
that's what I heard <malay>dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni</malay> [ah] <malay>pun</malay> doctor <malay>aziz juga</malay>
for <malay>bidan punya</malay> type [ah] for a gynaecologist <malay>tapi aku macam</malay>
<malay>tengok sebelas anak</malay>
<malay>sebelas</malay> [sia] <malay>ramai</malay> [sia] <malay>tu anak</malay>
<malay>tu pasal</malay> but <malay>dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil</malay> is quite young
I don't know maybe <malay>dia masih nak kena tanggung</malay> for <malay>sekolah</malay>
ya because they are much more gentler that's what I heard also then after that I'm like
then how my gynae female [leh]
[oh] <malay>pasal</malay> [oh] <malay>pasal kau</malay>
[ah] [ah]
but <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang takde macam</malay> one certain doctor with your condition like this
(mm)
but <malay>aku macam</malay> <malay>aku pun nak tengok</malay> gynae actually <malay>aku</malay> I I only have one month left [sia] for me to check for pap smear under my
(uh) <malay>kerjanya</malay> insurance
but <malay>aku nak kena pergi</malay> A&E <malay>nak kena dia orang</malay> check then after that you need to give some
<malay>bedek bedek</malay> then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
[ah] <malay>terus aku macam</malay> !huh! because if <malay>kalau aku pergi</malay> straight <malay>aku kena bayar</malay> out of pocket <malay>aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya</malay> insurance so <malay>aku macam</malay> (mm)
is it worth the ten the fifteen dollars <malay>pasal</malay> five dollars A&E ten dollars specialist
pap smear
how you like that
so

<malay>abeh ada orang macam</malay> come to defense [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia macam dia kena fitnah</malay> [seh]

<malay>tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam</malay> black magic <malay>ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at the same time [kan] <malay>aku tak rasa dia ada</malay> black magic
like in the first place he she doesn't have
that <malay>ilmu kebal</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dia punya</malay> intention to just <malay>pakai duit sidek ni</malay>
[ah]
<malay>pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni</malay> then <malay>bila dia bunuh</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>pasal</malay> she had no intention of covering it up <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> maybe the intention is just to <malay>buat pakai duit ni bunuh</malay>
then on the disguise of <malay>ada ilmu kebal</malay>
[ah]
(mm) but at the same time <malay>dia ada</malay> practice <malay>dia macam</malay> small time small time [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>macam orang yang kat</malay> quaters <malay>dekat</malay>
malaysia <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>semua cakap semua macam nampak dia</malay>
<malay>bebas bebas nampak dia semua</malay>
<malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] my god [oh] my god
<malay>abeh bila aku kerja kat</malay> [kan] <malay>aku punya</malay> colleague <malay>cakap apa</malay> [tau] [eh] <malay>kau tahu mona fandey</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua</malay>

[oh] <malay>atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik</malay> [lah] [sial]
<malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
[kan] [ah] <malay>dia orang cakap yang kat</malay> quarters <malay>ni dia orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam</malay> from three to six <malay>dia orang akan nampak</malay>
<malay>pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa</malay> so <malay>dia macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>tu macam</malay> !ee! <malay>seramnya aku</malay>
<malay>tapi siapa yang duduk</malay> cell <malay>dia akan kena gantung</malay>
[ah] <malay>pasal aku rasa</malay> cell <malay>dia</malay> it's just for those <malay>yang akan kena gantung</malay> <malay>nanti aku macam</malay> (mm) and recently <malay>kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia tanya</malay>
what is your opinion on the sentence
on drug offenses
then I said I'm for it and I'm not for it [lah] because
sometimes people who <malay>banyak orang kena gantung</malay>
because of self consumption
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>pasal</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> amount for hanging is quite high
[eh] it's quite low <malay>kalau macam kau</malay> five gram [jer] <malay>kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu</malay> five gram is <malay>cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
I'm for it I'm not for it [lah] because there's
<malay>banyak melayu kena gantung</malay> [seh] <malay>yang kena gantung melayu</malay>
[ah]
mostly malays <malay>yang si cina ni semua dapat</malay>
so <malay>aku macam</malay> it's it's already like [lah] where
<malay>apa</malay> heavy
sentencings for the black communities and the latinos communities for the same drug offenses
ya
yes
no [lah] in like the
the jurisdictional
[ah]
<malay>tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pun ada cakap kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>yang si cina-cina ni semua</malay> blue collar [sia] [eh] <malay>cina-cina semua</malay> white collar crime crimes [sia] and <malay>duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama</malay>
<malay>kakak ipar aku cakap</malay> think of it [ah] look at it
(mm)
and also <malay>dia pun tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how she feels about the death penalty I mean <malay>kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh</malay> is rapist <malay>kena</malay> hang <malay>ni yang</malay> rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently <malay>dia orang kena</malay> serve time then after that they come out <malay>mana boleh</malay>
<malay>pada aku rotan tak cukup</malay> [sia] bro
[ah] <malay>rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup</malay>
<malay>kau patut kena mati</malay>
<malay>atau jadikan</malay> subject of experiments
instead of like testing on animals test it on them
but there's human rights [lah] so <malay>aku macam</malay> whatever [lah] this people are not humans
<malay>entah</malay> because I think <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang fikir macam</malay> the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking [lah] so <malay>aku macam</malay>
whatever [lah] because there's much more heinous crimes
<malay>selain dari membunuh</malay>
<malay>merogol mencabul kanak-kanak</malay>
<malay>ni semua</malay> [sia] <malay>dia orang patut</malay> they should actually look into it [seh]
but
I can
drugs but I'm like <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
<malay>kau sedar macam</malay> it's like
a human life <malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] both of them play with human lives but then
sure they say they may like these rape rape victims may not be
<malay>kau kentut</malay> [eh]
these rape victims may not be <malay>macam</malay>
they are alive [ah] but <malay>dia</malay> traumatised for life
and <malay>badan dia orang rabak</malay> [seh]
[ah] [seh]
and <malay>badan dia orang</malay> may change <malay>macam rabak</malay> like what if they get pregnant from the rapists like [eh] <malay>jangan bodoh</malay> [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>boleh makan dalam</malay> [ah] (mm)
but <malay>aku tak tahu dia orang ni semua macam mana</malay>
then <malay>aku macam</malay>
why do you care so much
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers [lah] <malay>banyak dia orang makan sendiri</malay> like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling
so like
!hais!
(mm)
but <malay>kalau kau tengok dia punya</malay> amount is not <malay>macam lima</malay>
[ah]
it's not like
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>aku ada</malay> [ah] <malay>ni satu</malay> case <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>yang pakcik</malay> ya uncle [lah]

<malay>ni semua</malay> politic politic <malay>ni</malay> politic
[ah]
that happens [lah] that happens [lah] but then also at the same time I don't blame them solely because
<malay>si melayu ni pun musibat</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
(mm)
and also they live up to the stereotype <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
<malay>macam kat</malay> #geylang# that time <malay>aku yana aku tengok asal dia ni macam</malay> weird <malay>aku dah mata dah tak nampak sangat tangan ada gam</malay>

then we go and we go <malay>semua</malay> crowded like very crowded so I cannot see anyone but
I started to <malay>macam rasa nangis</malay> [tau] like my eyes my eyes starts tearing up I didn't even feel like crying but it tears up
you know then then you start to tear up heavily know like waterfall like
then ya I go then I go then I see my friend the friend cry then I even I even cry

like one day all these happen <malay>angkat jenazah</malay> that will be you one day [lah]
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> so
and you don't know what what happened to you after that [what] you know
only I known no one can
ya [lah] can <malay>macam</malay>
no one really to tell the tale [lah] in the afterlife [lah] basically so you have to go through yourself so that's what that's what
<malay>takut</malay> and <malay>risau</malay>
is the one is one of the major factors I was super scared [lah] you get and
some depends on the person also the person also can change

today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask (err) wish
you ask me what (err) what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I talk so much until <malay>semua dah lupa</malay>
I also I also short term memory
[ah]
what was I studying [ah] I was studying (err) radiation therapy so (err) radiation therapy <malay>tu kita</malay> treat (err) cancer patients [lah]
so ya my my batch [eh] <malay>kita cuma ada</malay> you guess how many how many people
[oh] very close very close so per year (err) radiation therapy is the smallest community in singapore ever so <malay>kita ambil dalam lima belas orang sahaja</malay>
ya it's the smallest (err) smallest more specialised (err) what you call that
(err) programme in singapore [lah] so <malay>cuma</malay>
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it [lah] it's such a small community
(um) but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it [lah]
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like (um) I deal more with (uh) like all the machine machine instead of people
cause my kind of person is <malay>nak</malay> (uh) ya <malay>suka berbual dengan orang</malay> like make that connection feel like (err)
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
in in a way <malay>boleh katakan</malay> (err) somewhat <malay>macam</malay> they they they they feel (err)
<malay>macam berharga</malay> [lah] cause (uh) I'm the one which help them instead of like this machine blah blah blah blah because if this radiation therapy just a bit you just shift shift shift the patient here there then after that
(err) <malay>terus</malay> treat <malay>kita cuma berbual sedikit</malay> [jer] <malay>setakat</malay> (uh) ya hi (err) sir ma'am how are you [oh] (err) any side effect you trying to stand are you okay [oh] ya ya how's the pain feeling okay K come sit down sit down
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
I I want ya I I want a heap if can I want to hear people's problem then <malay>macam tolong dia orang</malay> [lah]
in a in a way (err) the field [lah] I want to be is actually like (err) psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go (err) what you call that (err) undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that [lah] and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
(uh huh) so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do [lah] unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
(err) ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money [lah] like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly

[oh] then got the is it is it like out of twenty one kind of
[oh] I I got caught off guard
[oh] okay
[ah] that there's nothing much to me [lah]
okay let's (uh) let's see a random question [ah]
K if a human's <malay>kalau kita manusia tak payah macam</malay> (err) <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] then (err) what would you want to do

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
what are you doing <malay>bukan</malay> how are you doing
[oh] ya I forgot how is your <malay>haus kau batuk lagi ke</malay>
(mm) cause <malay>aku perasan juga</malay> like I notice your cough in your (um) videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and (um) and also like when you have <malay>kahak</malay> in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not (um) clearing her throat first before she talk
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
<malay>kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke</malay> and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
[oh] okay [lah]
have you how many times you had to use it so far
<malay>susah tak nak pakai tu</malay> like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
[oh] I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like <malay>lambat</malay>
[orh] <malay>kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak</malay> inhale like deeply [ah]
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school <malay>pun</malay> I used to have bad coughs <malay>yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama</malay>
[ah] I used to have to eat a lot of (um) cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic [lah]
(mm)
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was (err) developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my (mm)
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
I have <malay>kahak</malay> so I have a lot of <malay>kahak</malay> that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so <malay>dia macam satu</malay> it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
[ah] so <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> I can recognize it [lah] when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
<malay>macam</malay> at that time I think I didn't know cause [ah] before
how do I what
actually (err) is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is (um) <malay>tempeh</malay>
(err) <malay>roti kicap</malay>
I know I know no but ya I think these three <malay>yang betul betul</malay> I've been avoiding because
(err) at first <malay>memang</malay> I avoided everything I avoided like #vitagen# #yakult# [lah] yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt [ah] <malay>apa tapi macam kalau</malay> yogurt is in (mm) is like a flavor <malay>aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia</malay> is is in at yeast allergy it's like (um) (err) fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast [kan] is a product of fermentation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan</malay> because it's like soy bean fermented
(mmhmm)
<malay>kicap pun aku tak</malay>
[ah]
ya <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> [lah] is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] because (uh) in some <malay>kadang-kadang aku makan</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba macam ni</malay>
(err) <malay>apa gatal</malay> but actually you know (uh) when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new <malay>macam</malay> active (err) areas <malay>yang gatal</malay> and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad [ah] episode of sinus <malay>punya ni</malay> like <malay>selsema</malay> for like one month
so my dad told me to start (err) drinking <malay>yang</malay> effervescent tablets <malay>tu barakah</malay>
so I did and then he ask me I started (err) started drinking that and then he said that [oh] ya it's very bad <malay>padahal</malay> [kan] I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains (um) <malay>macam</malay> yeast <malay>ke apa</malay> but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
(err) so (err) <malay>tapi</malay> recently because I at first I <malay>memang betul betul jaga</malay> my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat <malay>kicap</malay> because <malay>kicap</malay> is such a common common thing <malay>kalau kau masak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia</malay>
ya ya no at that time she's making #nasi goreng# #sambal sotong# tau like leftover #sambal sotong# so <malay>dia letak</malay> [lah] <malay>kicap tu sikit</malay> just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like #aina# I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put <malay>kicap</malay> and I was like
<malay>tapi</malay> I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so <malay>malam tu aku macam aku</malay> [dah] ready [lah] <malay>untuk makan ubat</malay>
but I realised that I didn't react
so at that bad <malay>macam</malay> is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the <malay>gatal pun dia kurang</malay> [lah] I can control it so when (err) after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
(uh) nine months since I've been to the doctor
so <malay>macam</malay> I should start
I should start (uh)
trying out food <malay>yang</malay> I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay <malay>tapi aku kurang</malay> [lah] I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
[ah] <malay>cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti</malay>
(err) <malay>kicap tempeh</malay> yogurt [jer] [lah]
actually supposed to go and see the doctor <malay>bulan enam</malay> but at that time [kan] I was [ah] I couldn't go because clinic <malay>tu dekat</malay> #tangkak#
ya #tangkak# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# but it's far [lah]
(mm)
#tangkak#
it's
(uh) is like one or two hours
you know why because is <malay>betul betul dekat hujung</malay>
<malay>betul betul dekat hujung dekat</malay> singapore like really is like there
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya
because especially because my house is (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #danga bay# which is
I think [ah] the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
and then my window is facing the (um) memorial the #sungei# that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats <malay>ada kelong</malay> and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya <malay>tapi</malay> I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger [kan] (mm) <malay>kalau kitaorang balik</malay> #johor#
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings [kan] <malay>dorang semua</malay> [dah] ready <malay>bawa</malay> passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip <malay>dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari</malay> (um) like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
juice like the drink yes yes
<malay>dorang</malay> some some [ah] <malay>dorang tak</malay> produce <malay>dorang tak hantar</malay> that brand <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
at that time [ah]
so they will go there <malay>macam</malay> is a trip for them and then <malay>kitaorang budak-budak</malay> would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
ya and then
we'll all be like so jealous !wah! <malay>tak dapat ikut pergi</malay> singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore <malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>takde beza</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>sebenarnya</malay>
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in (um) in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
ya it's the same I think ya <malay>sama</malay> [jer] it's just that you know at that time I was like !wow! singapore
did you (um) see
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
[ah] that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the <malay>memang</malay> my family <malay>memang suka makan roti kitaorang</malay> we can go through like one <malay>bantal yang besar tu</malay> like two days so now substitute is wraps [lah]
wrap wrap
wrap
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay> always <malay>ada tu</malay> or you know like <malay>prata yang</malay> frozen
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
(mm)
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's (err) you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
croissant croissant <malay>itu memang</malay> one of the <malay>benda yang paling kelakar</malay>
because <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>terbiasa</malay>
ya <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] cousin <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>belajar</malay>
why are you not eating
[oh]
<malay>tunggu</malay> [jer] [lah] lunch is almost lunch time
are you going to cook or [what]
usually <malay>kau yang masak ke</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
[oh] how old is she
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(um) I think <malay>dia tak</malay> not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
(err) routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize [kan] it's not it's not just (um) <malay>sapu</malay> lotion on dry skin you have to be <malay>bilas</malay> with water first and then you have to pat dry and then <malay>baru</malay> you lotion because then <malay>baru dia ada</malay> moisture
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] ya ya <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know if I if I <malay>mandi</malay> awhile like
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
wear it <malay>bilas</malay> and then I put lotion and then is very effective <malay>kalau</malay> you moisturize it overnight
[ah] ya
[ah]
<malay>dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga</malay> that's why you know when I was
(mm)
(mm) but when I was younger and it was bad <malay>memang</malay> my mom would <malay>paksa</malay>
like
if she caught me
(err) because sometimes it hurts tau <malay>untuk mandi</malay> cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
shower
to make sure that I properly (err) you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat (um) olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>macam masa tu</malay> [kan] I
[ah] <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia</malay> powder <malay>tapi dia dalam</malay> capsule
[ah] and then [eh] that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills <malay>pasal kau tahu</malay> (uh) <malay>sampai menangis</malay> like I tried to eat it until I cried
and then (err) I gave up you know what I did
I open the capsule onto a spoon <malay>lepastu aku makan</malay>
it's disgusting <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm)
[oh] your your cough medication is too much
<malay>kau makan ubat</malay>
okay [lah] [kan] maybe
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know <malay>potong tiga ke</malay> to get used to it instead of <malay>makan powder</malay> [jer]
(hmm)
[ah] you need to take your time [lah]
(mm) have you have you done the portal
<malay>tapi dia macam</malay> faulty [lah]
can <malay>jap</malay> I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like (uh) after I register <malay>tak boleh nak</malay> log in <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> website <malay>dia macam</malay> faulty <malay>tu yang si</malay> #nai# <malay>cakap semalam dengan</malay> doctor john
[ah] you when you register to use your <malay>apa</malay> <malay>punya</malay> account
(mm)
try [lah] <malay>nanti apa</malay> I think they need to (um) solve on their site before they do before you can log in
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
(mm)
I get it I get it [lah] but thing is <malay>kat</malay> you need like a car
[ah] to go to work
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I think that's that's really the only <malay>macam</malay> problem that I have
(mm)
but
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tak banyak pun tapi</malay> they haven't responded to my email
<malay>aku dia ada dia ada dia macam</malay> (err) inquiry box <malay>dekat</malay> website <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive (um) interns undergraduate internship <malay>apa</malay> ya program
<malay>tapi dorang tak</malay> reply maybe I need to email them directly
(mm)
ya actually I I agree <malay>dorang punya</malay> one of the malaysia <malay>punya</malay> government or any authorities when <malay>punya</malay> weak link weak point is that <malay>dorang punya</malay> website is very poorly handle
[kan]
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
[ah] <malay>bukan tak pandai</malay> they don't see the need
[ah] <malay>macam kita</malay> [kan] <malay>apa-apa pun kita akan</malay> website <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] website website
so <malay>tapi aku cari</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>pun banyak juga</malay>
more opportunity <malay>banyak tempat</malay> but it's definitely gonna be far from my house [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] as long as you know
[ah] ya
yes <malay>apa ni apa aku cakap</malay> [oh] when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria [kan] <malay>aku pergi dengan</malay> #shikin#
and I saw (um) some of the stuff <malay>dia tengah macam</malay> recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
<malay>macam</malay> like writing on the clipboard so <malay>aku tanya dia aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau apa dorang ambil</malay> aquaria <malay>ni ambil</malay> intern <malay>ke lepastu dia kata dia pun</malay> intern
[ah]
<malay>dia cakap apa lagi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya and then she said that (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I ask [lah] <malay>yang selalunya yang</malay> feeding [kan] <malay>yang</malay> diving and feeding <malay>tu dia kata</malay> anyone that has a diving license <malay>boleh</malay> I'm like [ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I wonder also
(mm)
it's hard
<malay>jauh ke dari rumah kau</malay>
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's either you have a long commute <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>sewa rumah dekat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>sewa bilik</malay>
(mm) actually actually
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> #fasha# #fasha# <malay>nak buat</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> #johor#
<malay>sebab</malay> (uh) ya [lah] but she wants to be close with #shami# <malay>dia nak jumpa</malay> [lah]
so this so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> [dah] <malay>pernah cakap sebelum ni</malay> that if she gets an internship in #johor# I would I mean if we get in the around same area
we would rent a place together [ah]
(mm) but don't know [lah]
[ha] <malay>mari mari</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> #johor# <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> so we don't know [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>tak tahu kat mana tu</malay> [jer] [ah] when I think that
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
<malay>macam</malay> is I'm so scared
<malay>ye tak pasti macam</malay>
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship <malay>pun susah gila nak cari</malay> no no company would want
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak nak bayar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I did see some private companies <malay>yang bagi</malay> internship not bad [lah]
I think you just have to find the right one
#wei# you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer [lah]
[oh] [ah]
<malay>takde</malay> I'm trying to find material for my <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor <malay>bagi</malay> like
you know did I explain to you my new title
<malay>dia dia</malay> [kan] my old title was combining water quality <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) macromentoes
so I did my field work <malay>tapi</malay> since we cannot go to the lab
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
(uh) the data is from the paper that he published
<malay>dia</malay> [dah] published [dah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> co author [jer] <malay>dia bukan</malay> the main author doctor #chan# <malay>lepastu dia ada</malay> data <malay>dekat tempat yang sama</malay> of macromentoes so <malay>aku kena</malay> analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper <malay>punya</malay> data
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
<malay>dia punya</malay> paper as a reference for my water quality part
(um) I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know [ha] I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
ya
I also agree about the reading part
<malay>macam aku aku</malay> try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
<malay>pastu</malay> I go back to it and then <malay>aku akan</malay> copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
<malay>pastu</malay> I try to retype it
in a different way
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it becomes <malay>macam</malay> disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>gunanya</malay> supervisor
(mm) so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
[oh] <malay>laju kali ni</malay> supervisor <malay>kau laju</malay>
last sem
last sem <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> supervisor <malay>aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang asik minta</malay> ya your supervisor was so quiet
I think [kan] I think she knows (uh) means she learn from last sem
<malay>sebab haritu</malay> [kan] <malay>kitaorang ada</malay> meeting mentor mentee [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> doctor #chan#
and then he said that (um) #farid# ask how we how did we do as a class
uhh <malay>macam</malay> on the our presentation <malay>dia cakap</malay>
the examiners all are impressed <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> presentation
<malay>pasal</malay> our presentation wise we are all <malay>macam mantul</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> when it comes to the writing
[ah] writing <malay>kita ada macam</malay> slack
(mm) I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
(mm)
I think must me and my feelings <malay>pun macam gitu macam</malay>
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
(mm) sometimes <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it <malay>tapi sebenarnya</malay> okay [jer]
<malay>tak</malay>
(mm)
no but you know [lah] how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
(mm) I think
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
[ah] and <malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay> my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions <malay>dorang akan jawab</malay>
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita nak tahu</malay> [kan] we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
make sense (mm)
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
(hmm)
[ah] <malay>memalukan</malay> like you feel embarrassed
did you hear about the girl
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #terengganu# [eh]
did you hear about the girl <malay>kat</malay> #terengganu#
[ah] <malay>yang kawan</malay> [ah]
#wei# <malay>tu gila</malay> [dah]
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
(mm)
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
<malay>ye lepas lepastu dia boleh</malay> Whatsapp <malay>lagi macam</malay> acting as if like nothing
<malay>macam</malay>
[eh] <malay>bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam ramai</malay> [kan] <malay>orang punya</malay> story <malay>macam banyak</malay> version
<malay>kesian</malay> [dah] like
imagine imagine the dad
wife [dah] [lah] <malay>sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang</malay> first [kan]
but it's so sad [lah] <malay>tapi memang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> video evidence [kan] that she entered the house
(mm) <malay>dengan apa</malay> I think like hair in her hand
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> log in [kan]
[dah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I think you just wait [ah] because think somewhat <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
I think someone did text the <malay>yang apa</malay> doctor <malay>jaga situ puan puan</malay> #lin# [eh]
(mm) we just have to wait and see
<malay>adoi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay>
no if my mum is around I don't cook
(mm)
<malay>aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh</malay> [jer]
I do the after part
(mm)
[kan] <malay>dia macam semak</malay>
[orh] <malay>dia panggil</malay> okay [ah]
I think my
my mum doesn't ask us to help <malay>kalau dia tengah masak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> after <malay>tu</malay> I usually just go and see [lah] <malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta</malay> [lah] <malay>minta tolong</malay>
excuse me
<malay>aku pun tapi</malay> <malay>aku kurang</malay> [lah] because <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>tengok</malay> drama <malay>yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat</malay> netflix
so <malay>macam</malay> is a lot of more steps to
to watch it <malay>tapi sebab</malay> you know K drama they are so long
<malay>macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ</malay> for an hour to watch it
actually that's why that's why it
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people <malay>punya</malay> comments
but I think the K drama <malay>yang</malay> I watched that had a lot of (err) long episodes was prison playbook
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] I don't usually watch (uh) slice of life <malay>punya</malay> drama
I usually watch <malay>macam</malay> investigative <malay>atau</malay> medical <malay>tapi</malay> somehow prison playbook <malay>ni</malay>
(err) [ah] best
it's interesting and <malay>dia kelakar</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay> just a nice balance of <malay>kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar</malay> more <malay>kelakar</malay> than <malay>sedih</malay>
best <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> episode <malay>dia yang</malay> one one and a half hours
<malay>lama</malay>
ya #wei#
<malay>ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa</malay> [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [dah]
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I'm used to watching (um) english
english <malay>punya</malay> series english <malay>punya</malay> series <malay>paling lama pun</malay> like forty minutes [jer]
and then <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> [lah] twenty minutes twenty minutes [jer]
you know what I grew up on was (um) how I met your mother
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot <malay>tapi macam tak bercakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references <malay>macam</malay> inside jokes
<malay>pastu</malay>
ya [dah] you know <malay>masa tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia kat dalam dia kat</malay> channel hallmark
<malay>kot</malay>
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode <malay>baru</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> my mum was (um) was very strict with this about bed times [ah] usually <malay>macam</malay> ten <malay>tu</malay> we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister [lah] my oldest sister <malay>kitaorang akan</malay> sneak out <malay>untuk tengok</malay>
<malay>pastu kalau</malay>
I don't know [ah] sometimes <malay>dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar</malay> [jer]
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know <malay>biar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
let us get away because sometimes <malay>kita kena belajar</malay> [lah] to be
you know have to break the rules
especially because <malay>kitaorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ramai</malay> there's like six of us
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
[ah] <malay>benda macam ni</malay> is like a small thing let it go [lah]
I used to <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] my sister and I would break (um) bed time
a lot <malay>sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok</malay>
<malay>baca buku yang</malay> I don't know time at first it was <malay>bagus</malay> you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot <malay>kalau kitaorang pergi</malay> big bad wolf or sale <malay>yang</malay> like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to <malay>simpan</malay> and then the worst part is that we have books <malay>yang</malay> we haven't read but we want to buy new
<malay>tapi</malay>
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai sekarang tak baca</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> my mom [dah] <malay>simpan semua buku dekat</malay> my grandma's house <malay>punya</malay> store so <malay>kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam</malay> store <malay>tu</malay> but I read books on my phone now
exactly you just download the the book the E book
#wei# <malay>kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek</malay>
ya my my mom [eh] my parents have this friend
<malay>anak dia pun ramai</malay> tau <malay>anak dia</malay> like wait [eh] one five or six <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>semua</malay> boys
and then
(uh) the oldest one it's like us around the same age [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the last one the last one <malay>beza dengan</malay> the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
(uh) the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so <malay>dorang</malay> handsome tau
[oh] no I'm so embarrassed
<malay>pernah aku pernah mimpi</malay> I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
it's not any of the siblings is another sibling
that's like doesn't exist
ya this is this is is my dream but I often <malay>memang</malay> get (err)
often <malay>memang</malay> get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
I think because my brain doesn't really shut down
<malay>tidur pun fikir</malay>
<malay>ye ke</malay>
<malay>aku jarang</malay>
<malay>aku jarang tak mimpi</malay> then
like I do get recurring dream
<malay>yang macam banyak kali</malay> one of it I can remember is that <malay>daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil</malay> tau <malay>masa aku</malay> [dah] <malay>pandai</malay> drive <malay>lagi</malay> I always dream
that I'm driving in my family's car like the #estima#
and I don't know how to drive
but I'm really
that's like <malay>daripada dulu lagi</malay> I've been having that that one specific dream
<malay>sampai</malay> I can imagine it now
<malay>tapi</malay> actually I
I think it's interesting <malay>tapi</malay> most of the time
after I wake up
I don't really remember unless I <malay>betul betul</malay> put in effort <malay>untuk</malay> remember I won't remember
ya and then actually the the thing that I remember is the feeling of the dream
[ah] I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream <malay>yang</malay>
made me [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know it's a bad feeling
but I don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
(mm)

[dah] prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot [ah] #selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia macam</malay> I I asked my mum because even <malay>dorang punya</malay> engagement <malay>pun</malay> they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still (uh) is still like enforce at that time and <malay>tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri</malay>
how
my mum said <malay>nikah</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> and then <malay>kenduri</malay> we can think about it later

reception
(mm)
so we will see [lah] but I cannot imagine my sister being married
<malay>aku rasa</malay> but but because
(err) we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> I don't feel like
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> I don't feel like I'm losing her [lah] <malay>sangat</malay>
[ah] so
[ah] and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot <malay>tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja</malay> [jer] because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
[ah] it's like we are both the opinionated and then <malay>kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama</malay> like we
we watch the same things
<malay>apa semua</malay> so I can talk to him [lah] about and he's very friendly even to my family
(mm) casually talk to him so it's nice <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know my sister getting married
my first first time first time experiencing this
my sister my younger sister have to go through this five times

<malay>dia perempuan laki perempuan laki perempuan perempuan</malay>
the last one <malay>tu</malay> supposed to be <malay>lelaki</malay> but
<malay>keluar perempuan</malay> so <malay>dia tak</malay> balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now <malay>macam paling rapat</malay> with my younger sister
even though we have like six years difference between us
doesn't feel like six years
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than <malay>kitaorang</malay>
(mm)
form four <malay>lepastu tak tak</malay> matrix
<malay>tak</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dia adik aku</malay> yang last <malay>tu dia sorang</malay> [jer] <malay>dalam sekolah</malay>

<malay>tapi kalau kau tengok</malay> the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures
Instagram <malay>hilang</malay> then stay
ya
(ugh)
so
you know
(hmm)
I'm planning to make progress on my <malay>sebab sekarang ni</malay> we don't have any
(uh) upcoming assignment
<malay>sebab yang</malay> seafood security <malay>punya</malay> assignment <malay>kita tak tahu lagi</malay> [kan]
ya so I think I'm going to do my now that I can
(mm) <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah]
you know you know my you know my cousin <malay>yang kecil tu yang</malay> baby <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dia baru sebelas bulan tapi dia</malay> [dah] <malay>boleh jalan</malay>
amazing [kan]
<malay>tapi yang</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi rambut dia sekarang</malay> [dah] <malay>tak tegak</malay> [dah] <malay>rambut dia</malay> [dah] <malay>leper</malay> [a'ah] <malay>comel gila</malay>
I don't know I miss them cause [dah] <malay>lama tak jumpa</malay>
but she's very active and like she will she's like trying to walk here and there every day everywhere and then she likes to eat
she eats
best <malay>dia makan semua benda</malay> especially fruits
<malay>dia</malay> basically <malay>kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut</malay>
and then <malay>kalau macam</malay> my sister <malay>duduk atas kerusi</malay> [kan] <malay>pastu dia kat bawah</malay> and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then <malay>dia akan</malay> tries so hard <malay>untuk panjat</malay> my sister's legs
and then her mouth will be [ah] please give me some
<malay>comel gila</malay>
<malay>adoi tapi dia</malay> [dah] <malay>pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>main</malay> and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats <malay>kalau kitaorang</malay> video call [kan] and then I'll be like meow meow then <malay>dia macam</malay> !huh! where's that coming from where's that coming from <malay>dia takut</malay> then <malay>sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila</malay> she's so scared
I need
(mm)
[oh] ya I saw
I think you saw I saw I saw in your story that your the cat always come to your room

okay so the topics that we will be talking today [ah] it's (um) firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
(um) fifty <malay>betul</malay>
so <malay>maknanya kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau</malay> if you <malay>yang</malay> in ten years time <malay>memang</malay> you want to be in an area <malay>yang ada laut yang ada</malay> greenery where
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>kalau untuk saya</malay> for me [eh] I think [eh]
for me [ah] I like science [lah] so maybe ten years in the future [kan] I would want to have
I would like to live in my own lab <malay>atau</malay> garage
and maybe <malay>sebelah</malay> would be my like lab apparatus <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and [ah] whatever there is [lah] so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also (uh) ten years time probably (um) I would like to
(uh) I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
so if I have my own lab I would probably (uh) maybe add a telescope <malay>atau</malay> like some meeting devices so that I can
focus on my (uh)
my computing whatsoever [lah]
yes
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe (uh) so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so (mm)
<malay>katanya</malay> if say let's say you were
(uh) you were in your future house
and then (um) maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
(mm)
mind is stimulated [ah]
martial arts <malay>gitu</malay>
(uh) more to like action thriller
<malay>macam nak kena</malay>
(uh) okay for for me (uh) I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you (uh) in-hand situations about (uh) about issues that could surface in the future [lah] (uh) technology areas or
(uh) any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and (um) I think it it it gives me like <malay>macam</malay>
something to think about
ya and and make you like [oh] it helps me to
solve problems easily and (uh) see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode [eh]
<malay>yang satu orang ni</malay> (uh) she was actually (uh) she was actually trapped in a spaceship
the reason why she was trapped is because (um)
(uh) her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
computed her body into into a technological (uh) into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone [ah] <malay>orang sendiri</malay> [tau] so
so the boss <malay>memang memang jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>gilanya orang</malay>
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting [lah] how they plan to (uh) get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then [ah] sometimes he can [ah] turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked [lah] cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end (uh) some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so (uh) he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and (uh) there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape [lah] so it was quite surprising interesting [ah] how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that [eh] (hmm)
if you can become an actor
(uh) what
(hmm) if you can become an actor [eh] and like any actor [eh] do you prefer (uh) do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
like their their image you know what I mean <malay>faham tak</malay> ya so an image of them self you mean <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> fit body <malay>atau</malay> good looks
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
I think I will
I think I agree on that [lah] <malay>sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then <malay>buat apa</malay> [lah]
ya so I think for me <malay>kalau ada</malay> fit body is more satisfying <malay>sebab</malay>
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without without health actually (um) you can be bedridden and even the the cost of (uh)
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is [ah] not getting cheaper these days
so I think (uh) focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases [ah] correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
so <malay>macam</malay> I think health is very important [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without health <malay>memang</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> much [lah] you can't do much actually
<malay>mencegah</malay>
<malay>kena</malay> start <malay>awal</malay> [lah]
so I think one <malay>kalau</malay> pot from having a fit body [eh]
I think
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind <malay>sebab sekarang memang</malay> as you can see [eh] mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth (err) among the working adults and among (um) teens
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be (um) how can mental health be (um) what's that addressed
and how can be (um)
how can we (uh) better improve our mental health area general
<malay>cara</malay> holistic [lah]
I think mental health also like (uh) stems from other external factors <malay>macam</malay> maybe overwhelming of
school work <malay>atau</malay>
(uh) projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have [lah] that they experience so (um) like if you can see like the education system <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang memang</malay> very (uh)
very rigorous very very broad and very
it's very intense [lah] so like what <malay>macam</malay>
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and <malay>macam memang</malay> I've been schooling [ah] and I think <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
(uh) rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given [ah] should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity [ah]
but <malay>tu memang</malay>
(uh) off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system [ah] like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but it doesn't really appease them so I think <malay>macam</malay> apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but (uh) everything has been changing and revolutionised
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
(uh) it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you <malay>macam</malay> just just <malay>kasi semua</malay> on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
(um)
(um) how many one point two grams of (uh) phosphorus is needed to make (uh) I don't know cyanide or something
<malay>macam</malay> apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics [lah] and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion <malay>bila macam</malay>
you can think of how to (uh) not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
<malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] [kan]
okay so (uh) moving on maybe let's talk about
(mm) okay so <malay>contohnya</malay> like for now [eh] we are in the twentieth twenty first century
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever [ah] where would you want to go
and why
ya
<malay>cuba</malay> like for example [eh] you <malay>ternampak</malay> a time capsule
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
[oh] when you were a little child
work studies stress [ah]
we play
(mm)
I think that's <malay>pun</malay> what I would really <malay>macam</malay> really cherish enjoy
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
(uh) memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
(um) shape you and how you are today
[ah]
probably (mm)
I I think I would want to go to
<malay>zaman</malay>
I don't know maybe <malay>zaman rasulullah</malay> <malay>atau</malay> dark ages [ah] cause (um) basically the dark ages were <malay>macam</malay> a period of time
the <malay>macam</malay>
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby (uh) in the european universe or the western part of the world
[ah] there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but (uh) there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
(um) ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and [ah] people were killed and people were died from (um)
(um) unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
(uh) the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know #sina# [ah] #al jazali#
(uh) #mariam#
#rolab# and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science <malay>bila</malay> there's this two brothers
#abu sayde# or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam [lah] I think it's very interesting to see
I think it's very interesting to see <malay>macam</malay>
the the progression during that period of times <malay>sebab sebab</malay> during that time <malay>memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan</malay> idea <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>seperti</malay>
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
during the golden age and I find it really interesting <malay>sebab</malay> how their mind
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
even in engineering and science and (uh) it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's (um) <malay>macam kita jarang tengok</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam dunia ni sekarang</malay> [tau] most of the time [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang macam contohnya</malay> [eh] I have to (um) <malay>contohnya</malay> I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine (uh) philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once [lah] but I think <malay>macam</malay> ya I think it'll be very interesting [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you can like learn
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
<malay>sebab saya rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita</malay> just go far
<malay>sebab ilmu tu mana-mana</malay> and you can use for <malay>ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu</malay>
you [ah]
<malay>ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa</malay> as long as <malay>kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik</malay> and I think it will be very fruitful [lah]
<malay>ilmu</malay>
so apart from like
(mm) going back in time
(um) what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to (uh) have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to (um) to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal [lah] you particularly the elderly man take
(um) <malay>duit ke rumah ke</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
the third one
[ah]
(uh) I think first [lah] I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
(uh) I wish
(uh) I wish that (uh) world hunger can be stopped [lah] cause
or war actually can be stopped cause technically (um) <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau boleh</malay> share but technically like (uh) world hunger among there are many (um) palestinians
and they went in first world country
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [seh] <malay>orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang</malay> now <malay>orang</malay> [eh] actually <malay>tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada</malay> no access to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from (uh) camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad [lah] so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope [ah] nobody would go hungry [lah] in this world
and [ah] the second wish would be [ah]
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause (uh) we don't have the technology
because even from (um) the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
[eh] three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so (um) I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out (um) others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish (uh) actually (uh) I think I
I wish to have my own family one day #inshallah#
maybe next five ten years or so
so I think (um) having a family really <malay>macam</malay>
really helps me to
(uh) have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me [lah] I really like to learn
and <malay>kalau ada suami</malay> I would be able to
find solace in him cause <malay>memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan</malay> [kan] so I think having a spouse would be very interesting [lah]
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but (um) just hope to you know
(um) get married one day
okay so (mm)
so maybe (uh) cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
<malay>akhlak yang baik</malay> [lah]
I eat right
I think (uh) I think
<malay>tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I can feel you [lah] I think having (uh) having status
is not really essential [lah] but apparently
(uh) you want your friend or anything
even if you want me to have good <malay>akhlak</malay>
how can I contribute better to the society
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal</malay> okay <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>kita kurang berakhlak</malay>
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada duit yang banyak tapi akhlak kita</malay>
<malay>hancur</malay> [tau]
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
<malay>akhlak</malay> is more valuable [lah] than intellect
<malay>akhlak</malay> [lah] actually even if you have your own
(uh) if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be (uh) be taught to the world
but (um) having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life [lah]
yup
respect
won't look down on you [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah]
you <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay>
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's (um)
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you [lah] that (uh) having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
maybe like (um) what do you think if you <malay>macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam</malay> superpower
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> superpower like you <malay>nak jadi apa kalau</malay> what what what will you like to have right now
flash
speed [ah] speed
#inshallah#
<malay>kalau ada barang nak kemas</malay> #inshallah# [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you know I <malay>rasa</malay>
(uh huh)
I I like to teleport [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> teleport [kan]
I <malay>takkan lambatnya</malay> cause I'm like always late <malay>kalau dapat</malay> teleport then <malay>macam</malay> on on the speed of light or even faster than that (uh) just like be wherever I want to be just teleport <malay>tak tak payah nak</malay> passport <malay>semua</malay> so I think that's very cool [ah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau dapat</malay> teleport [lah]
I think the current technology <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] unless <malay>kita ada</malay> transporter <malay>macam kat</malay> star trek <malay>ke</malay> but of course not [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi contohnya</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau macam</malay> now's the <malay>kalau</malay> cause <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>memang</malay> is in progress [lah] what what do you think of
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
phones <malay>pun</malay> is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
(mmhmm)
<malay>sekarang</malay> google [jer]
you know is is very easily easy [lah] I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
<malay>macam kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay>
I think okay [lah] maybe <malay>salah saya juga</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> phone <malay>tu memang</malay> it serves like an educational purpose [lah]
ya and the entertainment purpose <malay>untuk zaman sekarang</malay>
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like [oh] [ah] when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like (um) we have (uh) we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry (um) some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to (um) playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind [lah] that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
(err) is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation [lah]
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think (uh) (uh) this thing
trait between and humans probably (uh) they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have (um)
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans <malay>ada</malay> this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things <malay>tapi macam</malay> they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very (um) like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think <malay>agaknya</malay> also I feel it's on the good side [lah] because
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
(uh) some (uh) some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
important I think apart from that I think <malay>macam</malay> humans should actually still take care of their parents and <malay>macam</malay> don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and <malay>contohnya macam</malay>
(uh) for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
(uh) like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> limit to it
I think one <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>pun</malay> very subjective [lah] <malay>sebab kita orang tak tahu</malay> like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something [lah] something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
I think ya technically <malay>macam</malay> you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world <malay>macam</malay> india they are very overpopulated <malay>kalau kita dah ada</malay> robot <malay>lagi mana nak letak</malay> [seh] human <malay>ni</malay> so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> you have to find a contingency plan <malay>sebab memang dunia ni</malay> maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting [lah] to actually to predict and cause nowadays <malay>memang</malay>
(um) especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be (um) probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
(uh) like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it [lah]
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
humans <malay>dorang betul-betul kena</malay>
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting [ah] to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from (um) human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many (um) so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even <malay>macam</malay> greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
very interesting
(uh huh)

sorry sorry
okay so summary
okay so (um) if you guys are listening to this I'm sorry but please don't judge please don't judge our situation now okay so
what were (uh) we were talking about this and then we we got reminded that wait [lah] we got reminded wait wait wait we got reminded (uh) that you know we could have used this time

(mm)
portrait the fuck
(mm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know <malay>macam pergi</malay> date <malay>semua</malay> [kan] he she doesn't even want to be <malay>macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam</malay> playground <malay>gini kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
<malay>macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok wayang</malay> cinema <malay>macam dua orang</malay> even though there's there are other people but
is <malay>tetap macam korang dua orang</malay> [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ya so <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> I think he is ready
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
[ah]
!oops!
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)

so I influence a lot of people sandra beth
adeline
I can do your marketing for you fake no kidding
just kidding
ya
ya I still an intern [eh] I'm still a student
ya
[eh] we should talk to each other not to the to the fella listening to this
with one stone [lah] [sial] with one bird !walao!
you kill the bird already then you kill more bird
ya [eh] so what did #aziq# say [ah] what did #aziq's# mum say
the divorce part
[eh] ya [sia] [eh] what happen [ah] nevermind it's okay

[oh] it was so much fun after a long time I <malay>tak pergi kerja</malay> then went back so met (um)
it's a small group [lah] not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then (um) the place also okay [lah] not so busy last time used to be very busy but now (um) because of the COVID thing so companies send their
[ah] their staff
(um) <malay>macam</malay> in a small group [lah] instead of last time one big group
a participant they only allocate (uh) fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like (err) two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
[oh] I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the (err)
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
group [lah] but no more number of days <malay>dia panjang</malay> [ah] (um) james was the in charge [ah] it's quite fun [lah]
I don't know because the deal is (um) they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges [lah]
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
(um) the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge [ah] one que
and one and then myself doing (um)
but surprisingly all the participant came for
[ah]
screening right they are prepared <malay>awal</malay> you know I mean normal
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
<malay>kerja dari rumah</malay> more relax they says [ah] then they say [oh] then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> one is from (um) one's from mycrone
if <malay>nenek pekik-pekik</malay>
(mmhmm)
because I told <malay>bibik</malay> to give anxiety pill early
I think <malay>nenek</malay> is more on anxiety rather than depression [ah] because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
[ah] she [ah] panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
[ah] so I guess it's more anxiety than <malay>dari</malay> depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit <malay>termenung</malay> thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then (uh) there is
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause (uh) every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
and she started want to pray then she [ah] <malay>tak yakin</malay> that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and (um)
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
not (um) it's quite to say [lah] couple of days when she was at the peak (um) which is really really very I should say <malay>macam mana</malay> very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
her <malay>macam</malay> worse or <malay>ataupun dia punya</malay> (um) <malay>paling tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya mengamuk atau</malay> dementia <malay>punya</malay> (err)
level
so as what you say [lah] maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like <malay>macam</malay> quite [ah] quite more peaceful (um)
(um) more <malay>macam</malay> if she she shouted yell and (err)
but not much and then (err) at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming <malay>ataupun nak minta keluar</malay> from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
which is different [lah] this today's it's so much different from the past
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just <malay>redha</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>ikhlas</malay> and <malay>redha</malay>
ya
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone <malay>itu sahaja</malay> (um) from last time she doesn't want to be alone
she's a bit timid [lah] I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister [lah] but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really [lah]
timid is different from people who is fierce #shah# timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
<malay>hantu</malay> are not human
she's very <malay>garang</malay> human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing [lah] she's very scared the rest I don't think so [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people she's not afraid of [lah] none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
ya she went through all the assessment
of course [lah] unless she says like stupid things [lah] then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans [lah] <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] accounting but cute [lah] she answer
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that (uh) these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but (err) she turned to me and tell me of like (um)
<malay>apa ni merepek nak balik</malay> [ah] which is funny [lah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you (um)
what's your name how many children you have <malay>lepas tu dia tanya</malay>
all the personal things [lah] then <malay>tanya</malay>
(um) past then present then <malay>tanya</malay> in between so
cute [lah] but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up [lah] so she <malay>macam ada</malay> rest and then after that continue again (um)
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no (um)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
you didn't
(mm)
(mm) ya
(mm)
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
(mm)
ya but the progression is like (um) the progression is actually <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] people
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much [ah] maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
(um) which <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] [ah] depression [lah] maybe [lah]
difficult for me to say [lah] because it involved brain and then like <malay>nenek</malay> they said that some of her brains already stroke
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
educate the caregiver <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
because <malay>dia orang ni</malay> sooner or later they going to be
(um)
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
(oo)
(uh) sooner or later she she will forgot how to (err) right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say [ah] [eh] I thought you want to (err) pass motion or you want to <malay>kencing</malay> and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that (um)
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the (uh) leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad [lah] mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
(um) professional <malay>ataupun</malay> [ah]
nurses <malay>yang</malay>
(um)
well educate about all this <malay>macam</malay> well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is (err) no the better [lah] no way I'm quite difficult [lah] this this this this dementia or old aging <malay>punya</malay> (err) problem [eh] it's going to hit the world
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
the youngsters educate the youngsters <malay>ataupun macam</malay> make it a point that
(um)
or <malay>anak mesti nak kena jaga</malay> parents <malay>atau</malay> there is this centre <malay>ataupun</malay> help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
<malay>kita kena ada</malay> this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
[eh] <malay>tak baik</malay> say <malay>dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik</malay> say <malay>tak nak jaga mak bapa dia</malay>
the because people don't go through
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that <malay>macam kita nak</malay> abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say [eh] <malay>tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak</malay>
so it's gonna be the same
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that <malay>ataupun</malay> european europe country <malay>atau</malay> the america they find that sending the
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
<malay>dalam islam</malay> okay <malay>kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan</malay> a must
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put (err) into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got (um) cousin [lah] she could say [ah] eight boys [ah] the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be (err) medical attention given to her [ah] anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then (err) third she got (um) caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver (mm) they have
(err) nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know (um) half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday (err) maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so [lah] because she's already bedridden
(um) don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) educate <malay>ataupun</malay> information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
that's that's what my opinion is [lah]
ya I know
(mm)
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this (err) dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya [lah] I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
[oh] [eh] you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
<malay>macam</malay> preparation for the future for the future or
old generation [lah]
I think so because but (mm) but I don't think so they take nowadays they <malay>dia orang macam tak</malay> encouraged but they are
they have this <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dia tak</malay> encourage <malay>tapi dia dah dah</malay> ready
<malay>faham tak</malay>
I did in this [ah] they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you <malay>dah tua</malay> you <malay>tak nak tinggal dengan anak</malay> you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a (um) estate where a lot of amenities <malay>macam</malay> vast or or supermarket doctors <malay>dekat dekat</malay> and then (err) the whole building <malay>dia orang pun ada macam</malay> (err)
(err)
how should I say <malay>macam dia orang ada</malay>
clubhouse [lah] something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
have campaign <malay>ataupun macam kasih</malay>
<malay>tahu dengan</malay> public no they just do it you want it
okay this (uh) we have it you know <malay>tapi dia tak ada</malay> encouragement <malay>ataupun dia kasih macam</malay> I find [lah] <malay>macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni</malay> not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
an idea <malay>ataupun dia</malay> come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system [mah]
they don't they they say said very (err) how should I say (uh) <malay>tak macam besar</malay> [tau] like very big <malay>macam siapa tahu tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa tak tahu tak tahu</malay> [lah] that kind of thing
you know like like like specially our money [ah] nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
so it's kind of like <malay>macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu</malay>
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
then they are they are well informed otherwise <malay>takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang</malay> be bothered <malay>takde orang tahu</malay> [lah] (um) that's the problem [lah]
that's problem [lah] people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right (err) your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card (err) see see and then (err) this this lady said !hey! you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is (err) (err) giving some (uh) help fund because I really apply then is it [oh] you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true (mm) how to accommodate right
<malay>kita tak macam</malay> based we are free religious
(um)
(um)
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious [lah] I think the more points of
other activity <malay>macam</malay> [ah] more of entertainment entertainment and activity [lah] you know of <malay>ataupun</malay>
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite (um) (err)
complex [lah] I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
(um) I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
old folk citizen soon or not far also but (err) right now people at my age I should say <malay>ataupun</malay> people at <malay>pak</malay> age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
<malay>atau</malay> plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both <malay>ada</malay> compromise both <malay>boleh</malay> plan <malay>sama-sama</malay> and both also <malay>boleh</malay> you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
(um) I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at (err) until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't (uh) take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
<malay>macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun</malay> I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
[oh] what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the <malay>dah tak boleh juga</malay>
I <malay>kena orang</malay> then I know I don't want to burden my children (um)
<malay>kau orang</malay> share <malay>cari orang jaga mak</malay> that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday [ah] one of my children must visit me [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>ataupun nanti cuti</malay> come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> [eh] <malay>banyak karang ni</malay> I see like <malay>macam</malay> my girlfriends
are people that I know [ah] they have mom which go every week go to every are of (err) <malay>anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu</malay> I I don't know whether is it a good idea because <malay>mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin</malay> is it
[oh] at this stage [eh] <malay>dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit</malay> is it good for her to change
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
the second option is so much better because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> burden others because you see [ah]
<malay>anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul</malay> [ah] children wants to but you must also remember <malay>anak-anak</malay> not the spouse <malay>ada anak</malay> I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then (um) <malay>anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya</malay>
peace also it's like (um) <malay>mak ni macam jadi macam</malay> you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you <malay>faham tak</malay>
unless you <malay>macam</malay> okay let's see [lah] this is
[ah] what I think it's good it's like <malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>ada empat anak</malay> I <malay>ada dua belas cucu</malay> something like that <malay>dua belas cucu enam yang</malay> very (um) <malay>macam dah</malay> secondary school <malay>ataupun dah pergi</malay> tertiary you know which they can help
you know so <malay>empat</malay> plus <malay>enam sepuluh sepuluh ni</malay> take turn [lah] take turns to (um) go to grandma house to this (err) monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then (err) this day to this day okay <malay>mak pula yang kena tinggal sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> take care out <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay> [eh] <malay>ada</malay> helpers twenty four seven <malay>dekat dalam rumah tapi</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> make sure stay <malay>duduk makan tengokkan dia</malay> the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be [lah]
rather than (err) <malay>kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis</malay> I <malay>rasa macam gitu lagi</malay> better [lah] <malay>emak yang</malay> in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
you mean you're not used to it that (uh) you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
[ah] sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
monday and thursday my turn okay <malay>dia ni</malay> wednesday and friday <malay>dia ni</malay> so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
[ah] contribute no that's what I think [lah]
I I mean right now this is
(uh) right now right now right now at this situation that I (um)
at present [ah] most of my (err) friends
other elderly parents so (um) I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in <malay>mak nenek</malay> into one station the rest all have to rotate [lor] whether dementia <malay>ke tak</malay> dementia <malay>ke pun</malay> rotate
[oh] maybe <malay>macam cik rosnah</malay> [lah] <malay>cik rosnah punya mak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu satu</malay> place when maid with with the helper than everybody come <malay>cik rosnah</malay> come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then (err) also so cute then they have this like <malay>macam</malay> caregiver <malay>punya</malay> holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then <malay>anak-anak lain</malay> have to sit take care
(um) so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam pada mak</malay> [lah] better <malay>mak</malay> that way [lor] I don't know
(mm)
[oh] you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
(um) ya
[lah] you got a point there also [lah] it's what you say <malay>tapi kalau sebelum dia orang</malay> could are given a task <malay>kita kena</malay> educate [lah] the main thing here the the the role model is very important
(um) how you want to (err) how you
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them <malay>macam kita tak boleh</malay>
(um) <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! this week I cannot [lah] I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go [eh] I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to (um) <malay>macam kita kena tunjuk positif</malay> that <malay>kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita</malay> look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment [oh] I can't
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that [oh] it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
(um)
(um) ya true
ya true <malay>sebab masa tu nenek</malay> okay
but <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang nenek</malay> have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really [ah] really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand [lah]
(um) that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is <malay>kuat takpe</malay> that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know <malay>dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul</malay> because <malay>dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan</malay>
you know <malay>kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana</malay> okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one <malay>nak cuba cuba</malay> calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
<malay>siapa yang tak marah</malay> even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
you know so quickly the other
party must come out <malay>kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun</malay> [ah] <malay>ikat orang tua</malay> (um) <malay>macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang</malay>
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid <malay>itu yang buat</malay>
(um) <malay>banyak terjadi</malay> didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this [lah] because <malay>nenek</malay> is actually educating me you know
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna <malay>macam sakit ke macam</malay> (um)
<malay>bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan</malay> (um)
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
<malay>punya punya apa</malay> mental mental <malay>punya</malay>
our readiness [oh] <malay>mesti nak kuat</malay>
ya really last time I people always says [ah] <malay>tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua</malay> then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I <malay>geram sangat ke</malay> then what is <malay>syurga</malay>
<malay>macam tu</malay> I can't even reach <malay>syurga</malay> if I do this to my mum
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
I take care of her not because I want <malay>syurga</malay> I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to <malay>macam</malay>
I she's get she got annoyed her you know <malay>ataupun</malay> you know I <malay>tak boleh tahan dengan dia</malay> then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
[ah] ya that's why I said because I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> awareness [ah] so it's something that <malay>macam</malay> god is given me awareness [oh] okay this is what you need to do [lah] that I need I can plan compared
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
[ah] twenty four seven take care of <malay>punya</malay>
[ah]
<malay>orang tua</malay> and then they they they now I have [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard <malay>atau</malay> by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
now it's a time for them to take care of me
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through <malay>tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena</malay> take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang bila mak fikir</malay>
or as what you say [lah] don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
(err) <malay>macam</malay> knowledge <malay>macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu</malay> I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give (um) <malay>macam</malay>
a talk <malay>atau macam kasih</malay> volunteer <malay>atau</malay> told people or need help <malay>atau</malay> need advice I think I have
I have the capability [lah]
the
(um) (mm) (um)
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have (err) your energy level is our only that point of time [eh] is that much
and then you have feeling [ah] that [ah] you are human that you know that (uh) sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
(err) emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
(mm)
forever ya forever you be
ya
(um) ya true true
ya true
(mm) ya
breakdown
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing [ah] technician go machine you know <malay>macam mana</malay> machine
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion <malay>dia orang</malay> emotional <malay>dia orang</malay> is so complex that we
don't know [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> professional you are a good [ah]
it you'd secretaries <malay>apa ke</malay> all of them based on experience or <malay>dia orang punya</malay> client <malay>punya</malay> patients <malay>punya</malay> experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because <malay>dia tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak</malay> okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay <malay>kita kasih penat tapi tetap</malay> keep on scream <malay>bukan itu dia tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> scream <malay>sebab sakit perut</malay> you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being <malay>dia macam</malay> twins [lah] twins <malay>muka sama</malay> everything <malay>sama tapi tetap perangai lain</malay>
(um) (um)
somehow you were saying that family knows best [lah]
okay (err) family know best in terms of tackling one (err) let's say the mother [lah] because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
her likes and dislikes you know the (err) for the professional we bring it to the they I just (uh) based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
(err) other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> family members <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> and then (um) very important [lah]
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming (err) since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
[oh] so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> they call it (err)
trial and error also
(um) ya true
(um)
so because chicken
[oh] complain and complain
(mm) (oo) (mm) (mm)
(oo)
<malay>makan</malay> ya
[ah] nevermind just like grandma [lah] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak bilang</malay> actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say <malay>nak keluar tak boleh tidur</malay>
you know she said [ah] <malay>mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa</malay> and then when we stopped her from going out the she said <malay>mak nak kencing</malay>
there's a [oh] <malay>sebenarnya nak kencing</malay> [eh] [ah] then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after <malay>kencing</malay> you <malay>tidur</malay> okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
(err) so sometimes <malay>kat dalam bilik pun sama</malay> and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place <malay>atau bilik</malay> is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
[oh] <malay>bilik dia sejuk</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar</malay> she keep on saying <malay>nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar</malay> then we keep asking why <malay>nak keluar</malay> then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us [ah] only if she could tell <malay>mak nak keluar</malay> because [ah] <malay>bilik ni gelap</malay> [lah] <malay>bilik ni sejuk</malay> [ah] okay <malay>kita tidur kat luar</malay> that will be much
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
(um)
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers <malay>dia dah penuh</malay> (um)
<malay>susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada</malay> some [ah]
crack <malay>ataupun</malay> ulcer <malay>ataupun sakit perut</malay> I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> baby it get get baby <malay>kita kita jaga macam dia punya</malay> journey is to be independent [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> old folks <malay>kita jaga</malay> needed is to be dependent
(mm) ya

(uh) <malay>ahad punya malam</malay>
so (um) the queue [ah] <malay>panjang</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena</malay> like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward [lah] <malay>duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas</malay> so
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana begitu</malay> but
ya like singapore <malay>memang</malay> got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated <malay>punya</malay> food places [ah] the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W <malay>baru</malay> halal [kan]
<malay>dekat</malay> jewel <malay>pun ada</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling
twelve chicken pieces for twelve dollars how big is the
how big is it

!wah! cheap [eh]
[a'ah] [seh]

not really sure I think <malay>macam</malay> crab meat
hot dogs
<malay>cendawan</malay>
#shiitake# <malay>cendawan</malay> #shiitake#
ya <malay>memang</malay> yummy
ya ya ya
#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>hari ini</malay> cheat day
K ya so <malay>macam mana</malay>
[oh]
<malay>bukan</malay> B B nine [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
[oh]
(um) K <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(err)
<malay>ke cakap pasal</malay> shares [lah]
so
so far
I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms <malay>yang</malay> offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to <malay>jangan</malay> invest in bonds
<malay>macam</malay> bank <malay>bapa kita</malay>
[oh] like <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> what you say is true <malay>cuma</malay>
I mean you want <malay>apa</malay> ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] <malay>tapi</malay> that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) <malay>mana-mana</malay> company I mean <malay>mana-mana</malay> banks
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>cakap pasal</malay> investment <malay>ni macam mana kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>bau dia macam apa tu</malay>
so <malay>dia punya kentut</malay> signify more to yes <malay>ke</malay> more to no
okay [lah] ya
<malay>kita</malay> (err)
I think she I mean she's free [lah] it's whether <malay>dia nak ke tak</malay>
ya maybe <malay>dia malas</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> anyway <malay>dia dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>dia</malay> okay
ya <malay>mahal sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>situ</malay>

<malay>semua</malay> resolution <malay>pun dah tak tercapai semuanya</malay>
ya true
(err) of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything <malay>yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> redo back everything <malay>sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada</malay> I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight [lah] <malay>memang nak nak turunkan berat badan</malay> [lah] <malay>harap harapnya macam tu tahun</malay> target [eh]
this year target <malay>nya lebih kurang dalam</malay> maybe fifteen ya
(uh huh)
serious [ah] <malay>sihat ke kalau macam tu</malay>
(uh huh)
yes
[oh] I cannot do the skipping <malay>sebab dengan</malay> spine issue [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> skipping <malay>nanti patah pula tulang belakang</malay> so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya achievable so I would say that <malay>kalau</malay> fifteen <malay>maksudnya dalam sebulan kena</malay> target at least two [lah]
<malay>tapi tapi sebenarnya</malay> one half <malay>pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lebih kurang</malay>
ya so that's another thing [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> vegetarian [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya before this <malay>sebab baru</malay> adapt to vegetarian so <malay>banyak makan</malay> processed food [lah]
actually adapt <malay>tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi</malay> I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>sebenarnya tak boleh</malay> so I was thinking of this year <malay>kalau boleh nak jadi</malay> vegetarian and grow my own food like <malay>tanam sayur ataupun tanam</malay>
<malay>tanam sayur</malay> [lah] basically <malay>kita orang dah tanam benda lain</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] anyway

I see surprise delivery <malay>menarik</malay>
I see so the surprise part [lah] <malay>yang betul-betul</malay> make meaningful

I see so <malay>macam mana sebelum</malay> delivery <malay>ni dia akan ada macam</malay> set set <malay>dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh</malay> customise <malay>ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu</malay>
[oh]
okay <malay>faham</malay>
[a'ah]
so basically <malay>ni macam</malay> (err) <malay>macam bukan</malay> professional <malay>dia macam lebih kurang</malay> special customisation [lah]
okay <malay>tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam</malay> (uh) food based <malay>ke ataupun</malay>
[oh] interesting very interesting I see I see so berapa lama dah</malay> start
[oh] okay [lah] okay <malay>maksudnya dah ada</malay> customer [ah]

<malay>betul</malay>
I see
(mmhmm)
I see so it's not just it's not just [oh] I forgot the date and I want to send it over I just send something it's not like that [lah]
I see so
I see interesting it's interesting so <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nama</malay> the surprise delivery service <malay>ni apa nama dia</malay>
[oh] !wow! okay <malay>kotak riang</malay> so <malay>kotak riang</malay> basically like <malay>macam</malay> gift (uh) box of happiness [lah] box of happiness
okay okay okay <malay>betul betul</malay> new year resolution [lah]
healthy food what what is the what is the meaning of the healthy food what kind of food
so dia sendiri</malay> [oh] okay alright alright like like less carbs [lah] less carbs
konjac #mee# [oh] the one without calorie is it okay okay
(err) I've read about it once ya I know
maybe I should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and [oh] my god taste like medicine
so what do you have for now <malay>ada tak benda-benda yang</malay> ya it's still give you some happiness in the world <malay>tapi</malay> healthy [lah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow!
I see <malay>tapi</malay> sugar free how is that achievable even
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food [oh] my god
it's terrible
<malay>menarik menarik</malay> so (err) healthy diet healthy food
basically ya [lah] <malay>macam kita pun tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>punya</malay> issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat [kan] [ah] so ya <malay>penting</malay> [lah] very very important [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
<malay>tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah</malay> when you get rich I will be the first person <malay>yang</malay> you have to <malay>belanja</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>aduhai</malay>
[oh] resolution <malay>lain</malay> apart from losing weight I would say that okay [lah] <malay>dia macam satu</malay> we have to look at the whole system [lah] [kan] I started with trying to eat
healthily [kan] I want to (err) I want to lose weight so I have to live live (err) I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just <malay>kita nak kurangkan berat badan</malay> is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet [kan] most of the thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak</malay> [tau]
especially <malay>sayur</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> I was thinking of and <malay>kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam</malay> supermarket
[kan] so we didn't know <malay>pun macam kita</malay> opt <malay>untuk</malay> healthily <malay>tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat</malay> so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya [lah] (mm) <malay>kita tahu</malay> economically <malay>macam mana</malay>
<malay>macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar</malay> with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money (err) ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt [lah]
[a'ah]
how is that
like for YouTube channel on planting food I see
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
[oh] interesting
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya <malay>sekarang ni ramai juga</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> monetise <malay>daripada</malay> YouTube [kan] and then ya <malay>betul betul</malay> and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
<malay>betul betul</malay> okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>orang kata tanam</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara</malay> [kan] ya ya ya
ya interesting (hmm) okay <malay>boleh boleh masuk dalam</malay> resolutions <malay>seterusnya</malay> okay
ya [kan] so I'll be like
(err) healthy and rich
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so <malay>cakap pasal</malay> healthy and rich [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> sum up [lah] the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya apa</malay> one word <malay>yang</malay> will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
!wow! [oh] okay alright alright <malay>maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni</malay> the the timeline the the stories not good <malay>yang</malay> you need the plot twist
okay
okay
<malay>untuk diri sendiri</malay> [eh]
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person <malay>macam</malay> it ya maybe with better networking <malay>kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh</malay> bring it forward [kan] ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself [lah] I would say that two thousand twenty <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
<malay>tak jadi apa-apa pun</malay> so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world [lah] like environmentally more friendly [lah]
so that's the idea
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>apa lagi takkan tu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa lagi</malay> share [lah] resolution
okay alright
that's right
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) ya ya
you you become a boring person [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) what what kind of me time like <malay>pergi</malay> bowling <malay>macam tu</malay>
I get give me some example on that
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada</malay> and then you want to enhance <malay>ataupun</malay> like new skill
because you don't have the money at that time is it
okay what is that I'm I'm so interested to know what is that
[oh] okay musical you have the artistic side [lah] deep inside okay
alright alright
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like <malay>jadi</malay> ya <malay>jadi pemain</malay> guitar [oh] my god
so funny I didn't know you keep it until this this year
I see but not guitar anymore [lah]
I see I see that's interesting that's interesting so (err) you you didn't have any basic yet for piano is it
[oh] alright
(uh huh)
I see but you were in primary is it
[ah] okay ya <malay>masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama</malay> I didn't really update
I see interesting interesting
ya piano is very elegant anyway
then
but but somehow piano like <malay>ini dua benda yang berbeza</malay> [tau] mostly guitar <malay>punya</malay> song it's like metal you know very hard [one] piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it <malay>juga makin besar makin matang</malay> you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
(mmhmm)
okay
I see so with before this <malay>kak long pernah juga ada</malay> idea <malay>macam nak</malay> enroll class [tau] and of course I want to also look into <malay>yang macam</malay> elegant elegant <malay>ni</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>cuma kenapa bukan</malay> piano <malay>sebab</malay> piano requires some set up [lah] then <malay>tak dapat berlatih kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> so I was thinking of <malay>beli</malay> ukulele <malay>ke</malay> violin something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you [kan] <malay>kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak</malay> wind <malay>punya apa ni punya</malay> instruments you need a whole band <malay>baru dia akan menjadi</malay> or you <malay>main</malay> trumpet <malay>sorang-sorang macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan</malay> Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward <malay>tu</malay> clarinet that's clarinet so it will
[ah] Squidward [kan] so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
interesting okay [lah] basically [kan] <malay>macam kita boleh tengok</malay> [kan] sometime our education system
focus on more maths science <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things <malay>tu dalam bentuk</malay> visual <malay>ataupun</malay> audio [lah] <malay>macam</malay> music [kan] because somehow that makes us
(err) be more empathy [kan] <malay>dan buat kita</malay> more human [lah] and in your own case [kan] <malay>macam memang buat</malay> hard science <malay>buat</malay> maths [kan] (err)
at the end you will turn to robot [lah] if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] okay so piano so that's the skill <malay>yang</malay> basically dream [lah] <malay>belum belum</malay> start [ah] do you have any skill <malay>yang</malay> just you want to enhance [lah] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada dah ada</malay> base base[lah]
how about that
<malay>ataupun</malay> something [lah] <malay>selain daripada</malay> skill (err) musical skill <malay>ada</malay> skill <malay>lain tak</malay>
[oh] mandarin why why mandarin
but mandarin is kinda hard though because <malay>tak silap</malay> mandarin [kan] <malay>dia ada macam empat</malay>
<malay>empat macam apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi</malay> something you know
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing <malay>sebab</malay> basically ya <malay>bila kita boleh</malay> connect to to a person <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> mother tongue it will be <malay>lebih ni</malay> [lah] [kan]
ya ya <malay>lagipun kita pun</malay> multi racial I think it's best <malay>untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga</malay> [kan] <malay>betul betul</malay> interesting interesting
(mmhmm)
offered
(uh huh)
so what what is your what's your choice [oh] japanese
so okay <malay>buat masa sekarang</malay> how many language you know like even it's amateur <malay>pun tak faham</malay> how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea <malay>daripada mana</malay> because you watch [oh] my god alright alright
really I only know like I see so
[oh] interesting so basically now you already have like five language already
five language already
anyway (err)
ya I think that that is enough that that is great enough [lah] I would say ya ya ya
so many language <malay>cakap pasal</malay> korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not <malay>tapi dia berkaitan dengan</malay> business [lah] since you <malay>pun nak buat</malay> business [kan]
you know the start up [oh] okay alright alright alright
so (err) who's your favourite character in that movie anyway
your favourite [lah] [oh] my god I think everyone is on his side anyway so
ya <malay>cerita tu menarik</malay> [tau] because <malay>dia menunjukkan macam mana</malay> yes
so <malay>orang selalu tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> business <malay>ni</malay> at at the end of the success [tau] like the only the tip of the iceberg [lah] when ya and then <malay>macam kita pun</malay> jealous [lah] <malay>bila dia</malay> lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
I would say that I I have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow I didn't regret any of it [lah] because everyday I woke up I know that that's something I want to do
even though <malay>macam belum kaya lagi</malay> but there every single day I woke up
I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years [lah]
even though I would say that <malay>sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi</malay> it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself <malay>benda yang paling belajar</malay> is you need a good mentor
<malay>macam bila</malay> you <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kaya ramai</malay> [jer] <malay>orang yang akan datang</malay> [kan] <malay>berpusu-pusu tapi</malay> basically <malay>kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul</malay> care <malay>ataupun</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> ride on us <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
ya that's the thing so <malay>cakap pasal tak kaya tapi</malay> means a lot <malay>sebab</malay>
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself <malay>adalah untuk selesaikan</malay> social issues like
ikut</malay> [lah] issue <malay>nya</malay> about environmental <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so because I do believe that in the in the in the <malay>keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan</malay>
<malay>kita perlukan orang buat</malay> business <malay>untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab</malay> if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work [lah] <malay>kita pun tahu</malay> politician have so many other things [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say that business <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide like <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide ya <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>kerja untuk orang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide service <malay>diorang macam</malay> in your case you <malay>nak buat</malay> surprise delivery [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> make people happy and so I would say that
business gives you more autonomy in some way
so at least you can do what you want
instead of ya [lah] I used to work <malay>juga dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> boss boss <malay>bukannya senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita salah pun</malay>
<malay>kita salah memang</malay> confirm <malay>salah kita betul pun kita salah</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
try error <malay>jatuh</malay> explore ya explore
[oh] my god [oh] my god that that is interesting
I would say that
<malay>jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat</malay> sometimes you didn't know <malay>macam awak tengok</malay> [kan] business business <malay>yang dah berjaya</malay>
that take years then even just take even one to two years [lah] <malay>yang</malay> one to two years <malay>ni bukannya</malay> entrepreneur <malay>dia</malay> #grant-preneur# <malay>sebab dia dapat duit daripada</malay> grant [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> basically [kan] (err) <malay>orang perlukan</malay> at least six seven years <malay>untuk dia betul-betul ada</malay> strong base [kan] so if you stop too early
<malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kita nak makan</malay> durian [kan] even though we already see the <malay>buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok</malay> durian [kan] <malay>kita sibuk nak makan</malay> durian <malay>nak makan</malay> durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit [kan] it's not going to taste good even though you <malay>nampak hari-hari tapi</malay> you <malay>kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> the the biggest thing <malay>ialah</malay> perseverance <malay>untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh</malay>
so I would say that
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya that's the beauty of it [lah] trying to hustle hustle and hustle until one day
you can enjoy the ripe durian
I also waiting for my durian to fall anyway ya
ya not too long two thousand twenty one that free hopefully hopefully
what <malay>kenapa apa what what what was
[oh] so <malay>itu adalah</malay> interesting part I would say that
I really I really like him
as a lead as a lead actor because
he is a good actor [tau] so basically (err) <malay>sebenarnya</malay> [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [jer] <malay>cerita</malay> start up <malay>ni walaupun dia letak satu</malay> lead actor <malay>yang teruk gila tapi</malay> basically <malay>dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang</malay>
lead actor <malay>pun dah terlalu</malay> superficial [tau] <malay>macam terlalu hebat</malay> so <malay>sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda</malay>
so <malay>walaupun awak tak tengok</malay> character #nam do san# <malay>tu sangat-sangat</malay> loser [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically that's how people at twenties <malay>macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu</malay>
compare to someone <malay>yang dah macam</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>yang dah</malay> thirties [tau]
so <malay>tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang</malay> production <malay>ni pun tak sangka dia akan</malay> backfire <malay>macam ni</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada</malay> synopsis [kan] <malay>ada seorang</malay> mentor <malay>yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>tapi</malay> because he is a good actor himself <malay>yang membuatkan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> move <malay>dengan perasaan dia sampai kita <malay>sedangkan</malay> character <malay>tu tanpa tanpa</malay> interpretation <malay>daripada dia</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin akan jadi</malay> character <malay>yang sangat</malay> annoying
harsh <malay>lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi</malay> because (err) the actor himself [kan] put so many emotions on the face
!aiya! many conflicts (err) conflicting emotions <malay>yang kita tahu yang</malay> he is not bad he is just
tersakiti macam tu</malay> you know
(err) <malay>mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> when I think back and if I am mad at #nam do san# I would say that I'm mad at younger me <malay>juga</malay>
but still as a as a
<malay>nonton suka hati kita</malay> [lah] <malay>kita nak suka siapa</malay> [kan] that is our own right <malay>tapi</malay> I would say it's a good reflection [lah] it's a good reflection
three years <malay>pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus</malay> that's the thing
<malay>sebab yang lain ada</malay> character development [tau] the other two friends <malay>tapi yang tu macam</malay> stay like just like that
ya just just better <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> coat <malay>sendiri tak payah pinjam</malay> that's the only improvement made [kan] [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] !aduh!
okay <malay>ada lagi ke</malay> resolution <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay> anything [eh] <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay>
[eh] small thing [seh] <malay>yang buat benda jadi</malay> great and big ya
[oh] my god that's so hard
ya ya
procrastination
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya [lah] <malay>macam zaman</malay> study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute <malay>kadang-kadang boleh</malay> push you
like push you [lah] <malay>macam</malay> in the very last minute [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> focus and sometimes your creative juice like <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> in real life [kan] when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as (err) persekitaran</malay> [lah] environment <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
procrastination <malay>akan</malay> backfire you compare to someone <malay>belajar yang</malay> it's just you and your assignment [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm) ya ya
maybe because you are a person <malay>yang</malay> work under pressure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you <malay>kena</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> combine <malay>kerja</malay> you <malay>dengan</malay> team mate <malay>lain</malay> like just imagine if the team mate <malay>buat macam tu</malay> to you [kan] at the last day <malay>baru dia nak</malay> submit <malay>dia punya</malay>
so it's going to be difficult
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
yeah
drag yourself ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> procrastination
and somehow <malay>sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa</malay> [lah] procrastination <malay>ni pun</malay>
<malay>sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya</malay> social media <malay>juga</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> in my own case [lah] I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so <malay>itu yang menarik</malay> then <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada tengok satu</malay> documentary [tau] <malay>dekat</malay>
documentary <malay>dekat</malay> Netflix [ah] <malay>cerita pasal</malay> social network [tau] <malay>macam mana sebenarnya</malay> since since <malay>kita guna</malay> all this services for free [kan] <malay>macam</malay> Facebook and all those thing [kan] basically we are
<malay>pelik</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah</malay> customer [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak bayar</malay> so <malay>tu maksudnya kita bukan</malay> customer <malay>maksudnya kita adalah</malay>
data (err) their their <malay>modal macam tu</malay> [kan] so
so <malay>dia dah baca</malay> [tau] <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour <malay>dia dah baca kita punya</malay> interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so <malay>macam dia tahu macam mana nak</malay> keep us hook <malay>kita tengok</malay> one <malay>lepas satu-satu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi satu</malay> !aduh! <malay>lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar</malay>
ya ya ya
<malay>macam fikir fikir contoh kata</malay> [oh] <malay>rasa nak beli katil</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar</malay>
[a'ah]
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us [lah] [kan] our microphone is always on <malay>kita tak pernah pun</malay> default <malay>untuk tutup</malay> [kan] somehow
ya
ya <malay>tapi maksudnya</malay> ya <malay>maksudnya kalau</malay> [lah] basically okay <malay>kalau diorang dengar diorang</malay> just feed us <malay>dengan</malay> ads okay [lah] <malay>tetap</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli</malay> [kan] but how about if bad people
peeking through your life from there
[kan] so ya
so <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam bila kita bila kita gunakan</malay> service <malay>ni</malay> for free [kan] for free
so <malay>kita</malay> basically <malay>menjual diri kita</malay> to them [lah] like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me <malay>sebab tu penting kita baca</malay> like agreements and all term and condition
but I would
ya ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] like term and condition if you agree tick <malay>siapa pun nak baca</malay> tick [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> that that's the thing
so
<malay>tapi takpe</malay> [lah] basically the basically the idea is <malay>walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku</malay> at least <malay>kita tahu dia ambil</malay> so at least <malay>kita boleh jaga-jaga</malay> [lah] more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm)
ya
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now <malay>macam dulu</malay> [kan] like ten years back <malay>kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa</malay> that is something like ridiculously happened [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
[kan] <malay>kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita</malay> (uh) <malay>cik boleh tak saya tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>saya nak tengok apa periuk</malay> (err) <malay>dapur macam mana ada</malay> hood <malay>ke tak ada</malay> hood (uh) ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person [kan] because that person <malay>boleh buat</malay> live <malay>dekat dia punya</malay>
<malay>bilik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya
ya
ya ya even [oh] my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched <malay>dia siap tunjuk</malay> the secret room
ya that's the ya
and basically [kan] <malay>senangnya sekarang ni</malay> with the technology <malay>ada</malay> the <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik</malay> your plan house plan [tau]
<malay>hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun</malay> technology <malay>yang ada</malay> with with pictures you take pictures you can even like <malay>kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat</malay>
okay so basically what if during the house tour people screenshots screenshot and redo back your house plan
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then <malay>macam nak masuk pun senang</malay>
yes and somehow this wealthy people <malay>pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan</malay> post so <malay>orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya</malay> rule <malay>dalam kita</malay> post social media <malay>ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh</malay> post <malay>pasal</malay> vacation after the vacation
yes <malay>sebab</malay> basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then <malay>curi</malay> [lah] <malay>apa saja</malay>
yes yes yes
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dunia sekarang</malay> different [lah] people
it's it's very interesting because people are less communicative
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing [tau] <malay>macam orang dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> communication <malay>nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>masa untuk</malay> interact [tau] so you really have to all out [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> people nowadays [kan] <malay>dia</malay> neglect
<malay>organik punya</malay> communication <malay>tapi dia boleh</malay> share every single thing about <malay>dia punya</malay> life [kan] <malay>tapi bila orang</malay> judge <malay>dia marah pula</malay>
<malay>orang tak</malay> like <malay>tak tak tak bagi</malay> reactions <malay>pun dia marah</malay> [kan] so
so okay <malay>cakap pasal tu</malay> that's there's one more [lah] one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution [lah] twenty twenty one [oh] my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone [tau] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa</malay> is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> check <malay>tu</malay> actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then <malay>macam</malay> then all the video sometimes is (err) ridiculous (err) like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
so I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dalam masa tiga jam ni</malay> I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] that's the idea
okay
<malay>macam</malay> quota [ah]
(mmhmm)
!wow!
[oh]
just imagine in the middle of cute cat video and then it stop [kan]
[oh] you can ignore [lah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> parental parental control <malay>yang terus</malay> off [oh] okay okay
just just to remind you [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam guru</malay> discipline something like that [kan]
<malay>tapi ada</malay> apps [tau] <malay>untuk buat benda tu</malay> which is very interesting I just download it [lah] <malay>macam nama dia</malay> forest [tau] so <malay>macam bila</malay> you start the apps [kan] you <malay>kena</malay> set [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja berapa lama</malay>
okay so <malay>dia ada beza</malay> [tau] <malay>tiga puluh minit dia punya</malay> shrub [jer] <malay>kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah</malay> [tau]
so basically [kan] <malay>dia untuk bantu</malay> you <malay>untuk</malay> (err) focus so you <malay>buka</malay> app you set <malay>tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja</malay> [kan] so you <malay>tak boleh buka</malay> apps <malay>lain</malay> you <malay>kena tutup dengan</malay> apps <malay>tu sahaja</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>tiga puluh minit</malay> you access your phone <malay>pokok tu akan mati</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi kalau kalau</malay> you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan</malay> notify you okay <malay>pokok tu dah hidup</malay> and basically everyday you have a patch of forest <malay>untuk dibangunkan</malay>
yes very interesting so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> basically [kan] <malay>dia bagi kita</malay> award <malay>macam dia bagi</malay> reward [lah] reward <malay>macam</malay>
okay so <malay>kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so depress
[a'ah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>betul sebab manusia ni sukakan</malay> acknowledgement <malay>tapi takkan kita nak suruh</malay> ya yes
<malay>takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam</malay> [kan] it's just like boss <malay>datang</malay> okay congratulations four hours [kan] <malay>tak</malay> logic [ah] [kan]

sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping [lah] so you will enjoy it when you so <malay>dia lebih daripada</malay> quality life [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
interesting I ya [lah] <malay>saja</malay> [jer] <malay>nak tengok</malay> apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep [tau] <malay>tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok</malay> phone <malay>sebab nak tengok sekejap</malay> [jer] end up [kan]
<malay>mula-mula</malay> [jer] yes end up Netflix <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> so basically <malay>dia memang dia memang ada</malay> design <malay>untuk bagi orang</malay> hook

they they keep their [eh] I know <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>macam cara dia tidur</malay> you know then [oh] <malay>tapi tak juga</malay>
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> ya cats can be very then <malay>sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam</malay>
<malay>ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang</malay> instead of <malay>bela anak</malay> [kan] maybe <malay>sebab bela binatang lebih bagus</malay> [lah] #kot# <malay>dari bela anak</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab bela anak ni</malay>
yeah maybe sometimes <malay>diorang</malay> investment so
ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh] my god zombie apocalypse <malay>tapi agaknya okay [lah] ya zombie apocalypse <malay>tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa</malay>
I don't know I I have seen the video people <malay>cakap</malay> the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say apocalypse <malay>akan berlaku</malay> so be it zombie or not but still [ah] <malay>kata</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers [tau] <malay>macam menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>orang yang boleh buat</malay> bunkers <malay>kat bawah rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> because you want to save save your family [lah] at least and <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> zombie [lah] apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada</malay> food ration
and then at least <malay>ada</malay> survival skill [kan] let's say [lah] <malay>kalau berlaku</malay>
disasters [kan] actually zombie apocalypse <malay>akan</malay> leads <malay>kepada</malay> disaster [ah] <malay>dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah</malay> [ah] [kan] <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so (um) <malay>kita kena ada</malay> survival skill
let's say <malay>kalau macam mana kita nak</malay> (um) <malay>menyorok kat mana</malay> [kan] <malay>ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab</malay> ya [lah] so far <malay>nak cakap pasal</malay> zombie <malay>ni kita tak tahu</malay> zombie <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
there's so many kind of zombies some zombies are dumb and slow some zombie are very fast so I don't know [lah] which zombie will come first so that's the that's that's
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see [kan] can only (err) listen [ah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak tahu cuma</malay> I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared [lah] [kan]
let's say <malay>kalau</malay> zombie <malay>semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita kena</malay>
[ah] <malay>duduk dalam air</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air</malay> at least <malay>kita kena</malay> basic <malay>macam</malay> rafting <malay>ke apa macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya it's not zombie [ah] we call it bunk out bag <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) bag <malay>tu ada cukup</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> something happened <malay>ada macam</malay> first aid <malay>macam ada</malay> dry food and then <malay>macam</malay> (err) your details <malay>pasal</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> your blood <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam kalau orang jumpa</malay> you <malay>terbaring ke apa</malay> you <malay>ni tapi kita panggil</malay> bunk out bag [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> ya but <malay>kalau kalau kita cakap</malay> zombie kit <malay>tu orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie [kan] but actually (err) disclaimer <malay>sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja</malay> [jer] [lah] it don't have to be zombie let's say [lah] <malay>kalau ada orang masuk rumah</malay> you yes war we don't we never know [kan] <malay>macam</malay> even though <malay>kita rasa</malay> everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year <malay>yang buatkan apa pun kita punya</malay> resolution <malay>tak tercapai tu</malay> [kan] so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so (mmhmm)
okay
ya
ya
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it [lah] so <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> overseas [kan] <malay>orang akan macam ada</malay> [kan] non disclosure [kan] <malay>macam tu tapi macam</malay>
I would say that <malay>berapa berapa</malay> probability <malay>dan</malay> possibility <malay>dia</malay> [ah] then <malay>macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya</malay> contractor <malay>tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam boleh berlaku tapi</malay> I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> maybe [ah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> for now I would say that if we <malay>pun orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] this for safety
but for people <malay>yang macam</malay> influential [kan] let's say say it's (um)
(uh) artist celebrity politicians [kan]
but
ya <malay>kalau dalam</malay> movie <malay>kalau macam</malay> mafia <malay>ni kalau orang tu buat</malay> bunker <malay>untuk dia dia tembak</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] [ah] of course [lah] we cannot do that [kan]
<malay>cakap pasal rumah</malay> it's very interesting [kan] how ya people try to customise house [kan] <malay>macam buat</malay> secret room <malay>macam buat</malay> bunker and now people <malay>sekarang macam buat apa</malay> #catio# <malay>untuk kucing</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>macam buat</malay> hub ya
cat is like social media [ah] hook you [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
why because cause you don't want them to go in the house anymore is it then
okay ya [lah]
ya ya ya
and make them you know that's the thing (err) we call it like cat nourishment [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cats used to live in the wild <malay>tapi kita yang</malay> bring in the home [kan] so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is <malay>kejar rama-rama</malay>
things like that [kan] so that is <malay>tapi kalau ada rumah</malay> the first thing I want to have is swimming pool [lah]
okay
seriously you want to hi and things <malay>waktu</malay> swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least <malay>bukan semua baka</malay> [lah] maybe some some breed can [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I would say bengal <malay>ke apa yang yang</malay> very wild one [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically <malay>kalau perasan semua kucing berenang</malay> most of them <malay>adalah yang</malay> short hair
ya instead of long hair [ah] <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then <malay>tak dapat macam</malay> wiggle wiggle <malay>badan dia</malay> how dogs do it [kan]
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place <malay>untuk macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> yoga with all the sun you know because somehow [kan] <malay>kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai</malay> mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then <malay>kita</malay> most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D [tau] but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight [kan] so I was thinking <malay>kalau ada rumah</malay> [kan] in the middle of the house I want to make sure the <malay>dia punya dinding tu</malay>
(um) made from glass no no made from glass so <malay>dia dia dia</malay>
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya ya glasshouse glass house
like <malay>buat</malay> like igloo style so <malay>macam</malay> #dok# <malay>macam macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>kubah macam tu</malay>
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> during this trying time [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya every new year <malay>pun kita buat</malay> resolution [kan] <malay>pastu kita buat</malay> plans and everything because we want to look forward in life [lah]
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam</malay> and most of dreamers <malay>pun orang rasa macam</malay> crazy people in the beginning [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok</malay>
<malay>macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik</malay> wright [kan] the the the wright brothers [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> when they want to fly things <malay>siapa</malay> [jer] <malay>yang setuju</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> now that is <malay>diorang punya</malay> determination <malay>tu yang membuat</malay> we can cross country [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> experience things on the other side of the world
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected [lah] <malay>dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat</malay> heavily affected
<malay>sebab</malay> ya [lah] <malay>diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak</malay> operate [kan]
[oh] <malay>tak boleh langsung</malay> ya then most people <malay>yang kerja dalam</malay> industry <malay>tu diorang adalah macam</malay> skillful people <malay>tapi</malay> in one area [tau] so <malay>diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain</malay>
(mmhmm)
I see and I would say they are very good in emergency response [kan] I see
ya that's interesting like paramedics <malay>pun boleh</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> like basic basic [ah] <malay>menarik menarik</malay> so ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
because <malay>senang</malay> [kan] bila orang kena</malay> lay off <malay>ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena</malay> lay off <malay>sekarang sangat</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> somehow apart from <malay>dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan</malay> industry revolution industry [kan] <malay>bila</malay> everything's automated <malay>semua benda pakai</malay> robot <malay>pasal dia akan</malay> take away our jobs [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba kita berlaku</malay> economic <malay>punya macam ni yang yang merudum</malay> [kan] so
ya it's going to be very very difficult to most people [lah]
and ya
<malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita buat</malay> business #kot# [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>bantu orang</malay> maybe provide more jobs to people [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> the economy have to run [lah]
ya
ya because somehow <malay>dengan ramai orang kena</malay> laid off employer <malay>pun ada banyak sangat pilihan</malay> so the competition is very very high
yes yes most most business are barely surviving
<malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
and <malay>cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada</malay> business [kan] [lah]
I would say that <malay>kesan besar kepada</malay> education system <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> kids nowadays I would say sometimes <malay>bagus juga sebab orang dah mula</malay> adopt online learning <malay>sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan</malay> interactions
<malay>dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam</malay> universities [kan] some universities are (err) fully (err) fully on online platform [kan]
<malay>tapi bila kita dekat</malay> university <malay>kita bukannya hanya belajar</malay> theory <malay>dan kita punya</malay> subject <malay>tapi</malay> life lesson <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita belajar</malay> communicate <malay>kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi</malay> [kan] so all that <malay>adalah</malay> very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime <malay>boleh juga bagi tapi</malay> I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
even though they are tech savvy (mmhmm)
ya <malay>betul betul</malay> ya
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> friends <malay>adalah orang yang</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> choose ya [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
you <malay>boleh</malay> choose and and <malay>boleh</malay> align <malay>minat dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] compare to <malay>ni</malay> then ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> same [eh] <malay>macam</malay> peer [kan] <malay>macam</malay> same age peer <malay>sangat sangat penting untuk kita</malay> associate <malay>untuk kita faham</malay>
<malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so
ya <malay>akan jadi ada</malay> impact <malay>yang besar</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada</malay> characters building <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dalam keadaan yang mencabar</malay>
ya just imagine before this <malay>pun</malay> graduates <malay>susah nak dapat kerja</malay> because
it's a very competitive market [kan] and now <malay>kita ada</malay> so many
(err) talented people <malay>kena</malay> laid off and compete together with them
ya <malay>macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> compete each other <malay>pun dah</malay> hard enough and then <malay>kena</malay> compete <malay>lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun</malay> experience it's not going to be easy
<malay>tapi</malay> new economy <malay>pun akan terbuka</malay> [lah] <malay>macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi</malay> influencer [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> ya like influencer <malay>pun boleh</malay> give money
(uh huh)
!wow!
<malay>dah lama</malay> [kan]
life goal [lah]
<malay>cuma bahaya dengan</malay> being influencer <malay>ni</malay> sometimes they are not being human [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
and they ya and <malay>diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu</malay> social status <malay>yang</malay> sometimes unachievable <malay>kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk bagi nampak</malay> abs <malay>nampak kurus</malay> sometimes it's just about angle
then people <malay>yang</malay> see that they didn't know <malay>pun itu adalah</malay> angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that <malay>sedangkan</malay> all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle [kan] camera trick that's the thing sometimes
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi lebih mencabar</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kita punya</malay> youth <malay>kalau keadaan macam ni</malay> ya [lah] lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
(mmhmm)
ya even big brands <malay>pun sekarang dah</malay> start to work with influencers instead of artists <malay>yang memang buat</malay> art [tau] <malay>berkarya</malay>
okay [lah] somehow artist people <malay>diorang</malay> charge <malay>memang terlalu mahal</malay> [kan] and influencers <malay>dia ada dia ada</malay> bigger fan base
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya <malay>faham</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>dan</malay> artist <malay>dan</malay> actress <malay>ni dia terpaksa</malay> produce something <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>baru orang boleh</malay> look up to them [kan] compared to influencer <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>pergi makan pun orang suka</malay> [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>pun orang suka</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam cuma tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh</malay> set unrealistic thing [ah]
so !fuh! <malay>banyak juga kita borak ni</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> resolution <malay>cerita pasal</malay> zombie apocalypse <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so ya hopefully <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>yang penting kita</malay> start <malay>sekarang buat sekarang macam</malay>
ya <malay>boleh</malay>
it's going to be a tough year but it's going to be interesting and fun [lah]
yes hopefully okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>untuk</malay> family [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> family (err) I would say that more collaborations <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] before this I would say that I live on my own [lah] <malay>pun duduk macam jauh</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I want this family to be more collaborative like <malay>masak sama-sama</malay>
<malay>buat kerja sama-sama</malay> and even though <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu</malay> you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one [kan] even though of course [lah] <malay>macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically [ah] but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
(err)
<malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kita pun kena bergerak sebagai</malay> family
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> how about you <malay>apa yang</malay> you (uh) foresee for as a family <malay>punya</malay> movement
(mmhmm)
(mm) even the silly silly stuff [lah]
ya true true
<malay>aduhai</malay> okay [lah]
ya
ya ya ya hopefully [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and it don't have to be far <malay>pun</malay> but at least places that we can
just leave the work behind and just connect as a humans [lah] as siblings as
daughters and son and all ya [lah]
okay <malay>jom rasanya</malay>
<malay>rasanya</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita</malay> start put in the planner <malay>ataupun buat</malay> vision board [kan] <malay>letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa</malay> [kan] and <malay>satu benda lagi</malay> it's good [tau] actually <malay>bila kita</malay> tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya because when we say it [kan] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end of the year <malay>nanti macam</malay> [eh] <malay>apa jadi dengan</malay> <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>

used to explore things during primary school [kan]
<malay>sekarang aku baru ingat balik</malay> actually ya [lah] actually quite true [lah] <malay>macam aku</malay> used to
primary school <malay>aku dulu kat</malay> #katong# <malay>punya</malay> area [kan] then
then there was <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
<malay>macam</malay> drains <malay>ada banyak longkang-longkang besar</malay>

I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that [lah] so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought (um) monday since since (uh) like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay [lah] the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night [lah] night shift like I can work from eleven to
(err) eleven to I think
seven [ah] seven seven eleven near
near my house [lah] near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny [leh] I I didn't
I didn't get a reply [ah] they didn't reply me it's actually
I thought <malay>macam</malay> I thought like I thought
<malay>macam</malay> like seven eleven jobs is easy to get [kan] but
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get [seh] I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job [kan]
[ah] yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're (err) ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so [ah] it's easy for me to
to work somewhere in (uh) plaza <malay>singapura</malay> [lah] plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then I can (err) it's
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier [lah] so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name

the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy

now I'm waiting for another call [lah] then they so far never call they're taking quite some time [ah] I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true [lah] true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that (err) right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that (um)
some people are not really serious about the job [lah] they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point [lah] so
that's what my mother said [lah] then I I think I think quite
true [lah] like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
(err) I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they [ah] (um)
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
(err) diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary [lah] a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs [lah] so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya [lah] of course [lah] I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus

right now like age catching up [lah] definitely like (um)
ya getting easily more tired or you know like (um)
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different [lah] when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like (um) [oh] I'm the best I can do
[oh] I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
(um) you realize
you're not really the best [ah] other people better than you or then you

ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing [lah] then I I
you know I I I decided to <malay>macam</malay> I came to
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing [lah] so it's not like
it's not something you can like <malay>belek</malay> here <malay>belek</malay> there and like go
just go out you know like
(um)
and not get caught or what <malay>macam</malay>
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also [lah]
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] [eh] I remember I remember those times [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
weird [lah] you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly (um)
(hmm)
(mm)
ya (mm) definitely different
different time [lah] you know (err) nobody
nobody expected this to happen [lah] so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed [lah] that time they a lot of people stressed (err) a lot of (uh)
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry [lah] then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct (mm)
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs [eh] actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like #tampines# interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from #tampines# interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like (um)
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
(err) cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
(err) hopeless [lah] you feel quite sad [lah] like like like <malay>macam</malay> like
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot (uh) like harder
times [lah] a lot of people going through like more hardship [lah] you know that
if you think you are like
<malay>macam</malay> going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship [lah] like
quite sometimes I feel quite (um)
I just feel quite sad [lah] sometimes when I see all this [lah] ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced [lah] forced to
forced to stop working and
ya that one ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [lah] there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of <malay>macam</malay> views on that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
will say different things [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
like nature nature telling us something <malay>ke apa</malay> you know that kind of thing so
ya but anyway like (um)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] we just have to make the best of it [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I mean (um) ya definitely <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku baca dekat</malay> news
<malay>aku baca dekat</malay> (uh) yahoo news that <malay>macam</malay> a lot of a lot of deejays <malay>yang main</malay>
a lot of like (uh) house deejays I mean like resident deejays <malay>yang main dekat macam</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> fullerton <malay>dekat</malay> you know <malay>dekat</malay>
wherever [lah]
ya ya all the deejays <malay>yang</malay> spin
<malay>semua</malay> most of them out of job [lah] <malay>habis</malay>
from earning like <malay>macam</malay> like
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business [ah] catering business they do sell
like food online or online or <malay>macam</malay> food delivery online then
ya then it's not only that [lah] (uh) basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped [lah] then no cannot get money [lah] music business
bars and all that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> whatever that has music [ah]
so the next thing that
actually <malay>macam</malay> counter that thing <malay>yang</malay> is actually can survive and
(err) like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies [lah] video
I mean (um)
[ah] [ah] if you're comparing <malay>macam</malay> like music [eh] audio and video right
right now video is doing
more important [lah] video is doing well [lah] like ya (um)
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a (err) (uh) to make a content right so
(uh) right now video is important [lah] <malay>macam</malay> there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs (err)
are out there [lah] there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
ya [lah] so sometimes I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I if had taken a video (err) course or what then
would have been different [lah] but but ya [lah] <malay>macam nasib</malay> [ah]

then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like sometimes

I was doing backstage work
and then <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) one day like (uh) my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything [ah] is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
somehow they get somebody cause <malay>kita</malay> free [kan] they get us to just lie there
lie there then after that I say okay so (um) it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay [lah] my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
like in the middle of the show [lah] before intermission one of the character <malay>cakap</malay> what the character say <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who is this you know then after that reveal [lah] so like !wah! a dead body
and (um)
until the end everybody <malay>dah balik</malay>
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try [lah] two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
but ya [lah] because cannot cannot move [what] so my <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you know
but then <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you cannot move right so you need to learn <malay>macam</malay> your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise <malay>yang</malay> how hard it was until (um) they got a review [lah] somebody wrote a review then <malay>cakap</malay>
complain [lah] they complain <malay>banyak banyak</malay> about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
<malay>cakap</malay> about the best potrayal was the portrayal
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing <malay>bila</malay> I think got this [one] (uh) <malay>kakak melayu</malay>
watching the show and then (um) second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like #astaghfirullahalazim# she was like

my there will be a set [kan] <malay>kat belakang tu ada macam ada</malay> the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me [lah] ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that [lah] so I
so my leg actually <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] my leg can move but then (err) just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
considered (um)

there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) can you just
(uh) take over whoever's not here [lah] so I was just doing my job very well [lah] whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
and then my director <malay>macam</malay> !wah! I never knew you can act [eh] so then she text me then say okay then next time (um) can you take over his role [lah] because he's very problematic

(um)
okay [lah] but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
[ah]
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay [lah] is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a (um) <malay>apa doktor badut dorang panggil</malay> (um)
no [lah] I think growing up I very you cannot decide [lah] nowadays also I also think about it <malay>kita</malay> we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing [lah] I want to grow up I want to become
power ranger then I was like okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] power ranger but you know
(um)
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist <malay>pasal</malay> my <malay>gigi berterabuh</malay>
my <malay>gigi</malay> I think fall down and then (uh) I all of my front teeth <malay>semua macam</malay>
<malay>hitam</malay> [tau] like <malay>pasal</malay> I think it it was chipped and then after that <malay>ada ada darah</malay> stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
I think it was because I was sick then I realise (ugh) you know what if only I can become a doctor and then (um) I just got the idea from a lot people [lah] one thing I wanted to become scientist also <malay>pasal</malay> that time <malay>pergi madrasah</malay> then after that my <malay>ustazah cakap apa</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau ada lalat tu</malay> [kan] <malay>lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul</malay>
<malay>pasal apa sebelah</malay>
<malay>dia punya apa apa dia cakap dia punya</malay>
<malay>kepak dia tu</malay> [kan] <malay>satu</malay> one side <malay>kepak dia ada</malay> (uh)
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other <malay>punya kepak tu ada</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> antidote <malay>penawar dia</malay> the medicines I want to say who [ah] I I'm curious [ah]
which side of the of the <malay>kepak</malay> of the <malay>lalat tu yang mana satu</malay> toxic <malay>yang mana satu</malay> what
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course [lah] that
<malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why [eh] [oh] I know why
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I <malay>kena</malay> punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got (err) theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
so <malay>dia cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> cool [eh] <malay>korang apa ni</malay> what you do performance and I enjoy that [lah] but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful [lah]
<malay>pasal</malay> to get into medicine here at that time [ah] for me you need to get straight four A's
and I wasn't doing very well in [eh] no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry [eh] no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] but anyway ya
so ya [lah] and (err) I remember my teacher you know mister #yaz# telling me to like [eh] <malay>bila</malay> ya [lah] where are you going to
just drop one subject [lah] just drop one subject because they were they care so much about <malay>apa ni dia punya</malay> school <malay>punya</malay> standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible [lah] so ya but then in the end I just decided to
(uh) attended this [lah] you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
this person <malay>tak boleh ajar</malay> ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say [eh] you are actually quite good [ah] (uh)
like that [ah] so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay [lah] give you more job [ah] then now I started learn

nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill (uh) I want (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(um)
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will [lah] [ah]
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move [ah]
the flying the flying arm bar I remember <malay>dia ajar macam mana nak buat</malay> flying arm bar
<malay>ni masih</malay> uni [ah] I think because
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
doing <malay>merepek-merepek</malay> stuff
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
because I did I do film school right so he study <malay>apa tu</malay>
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie [ah] a fighting film [ah]
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps [ah] then I okay then <malay>aku</malay> more to learn [lah] then he show me a flying arm bar
cool [lah] but (mm)
and I don't like to fight [ah]
ya ya ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> I got the video [ah] choreo but I remember it was (uh)
like ya ya so you you hook on to the <malay>tangan</malay> and then after that one of the <malay>kaki</malay> will
ya <malay>gitu sekali banyak kali</malay> [ah] that move actually they look a lot <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> what a lot of the fightings sequences [lah] that kind of hollywood
ya but then no [lah] I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
[eh] you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no [lah] just (uh) (uh) (uh) generic
(um) a lot of the but (uh) just basic ones [lah] very introduction to all the different therapies [lah]
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
<malay>pasal</malay> okay so now [eh] do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know (uh) I was <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend [ah] think of (uh) somebody you <malay>jumpa</malay> every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person <malay>tanya</malay> okay #ayisha# (uh) can I (uh) <malay>macam</malay> stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
[eh] [oh] okay <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [eh]
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
<malay>kalau</malay> an asker
they know <malay>dorang tahu yang apa tu</malay> if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
okay if you can like you said okay can [lah] you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay [lah] two weeks right
but some people they might say that
[eh]
two weeks <malay>macam</malay>
not as <malay>lama</malay> [lah] but they will say like how how could this person even
dare to ask me we're not even that close (um) you know
you know
how dare they ask me like that question <malay>asal dia tak fikir pasal</malay> so there's a lot of like issues that come with it <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
we take that example is not a very good example [lah] like one (uh) like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
you either <malay>macam</malay>
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks <malay>dia macam kurang ajar</malay> [lah] very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
(um)
got the hull invert (um) because they think like <malay>ada</malay>
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that [lah] but then
in the end (um)
but for so that's a point on guesser [lah] so I realised <malay>kita</malay>
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
there's a yes or no (um) people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why [ah] <malay>apa</malay> motive <malay>kau</malay> [eh] what is it for <malay>faham tak</malay>
so I'm learning about that [ah] so it's very (uh) and I (err) so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example [lah]
(uh) [oh] <malay>aku perasan apa yang</malay> you leave your
you clothes around [ah] you know it made me feel (uh) like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel (um)
that
(uh) you feel [lah]
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
that that <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that [lah] I
if you could pick up your own stuff
(um)
would you be doing it [lah] am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well [lah] okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
if it is a western country I think <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay [lah] you ask me then I can say yes I can say no [lah]
<malay>tapi kalau kat sana kau cakap kau boleh tak angkat kau punya baju-baju</malay>
ya it's like a demand [kan] to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how [ah] how to
balance that out I try to figure it out [lah]
ya but won't
(mm)
but they don't understand <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
(uh) <malay>dorang tak faham</malay>
<malay>apa beza dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya I see hard [ah]
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
(um)
<malay>impian</malay> [eh]

(hmm) three wishes right
(uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> wishes <malay>ni mesti lebih realistik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh yang merepek-merepek</malay> [lah] okay <malay>kalau realistik</malay> wishes <malay>aku rasa aku nak</malay> get rich [lah] one of it [lah] one of it maybe <malay>untuk</malay> get rich
the reason <malay>aku nak kaya pasal</malay> actually (err) <malay>aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan</malay>
I want to help the poor maybe (uh) I feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then <malay>kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi</malay> fit [ah] <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> fit <malay>aku</malay> fit <malay>aku rasa macam aku pergi lari</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok# reservoir <malay>ke</malay> macritchie <malay>ke</malay> I feel that (uh) my body feels good [lah] so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
then next (uh) the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what I see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
superpower okay so (err) we are moving from realistic to not so realistic [ah] okay so superpower <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kalau tengok cerita</malay> X men [eh] <malay>dia sikit-sikit macam</malay> night crawler
(err) so <malay>kalau</malay> teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent <malay>pasal [lah] tu</malay> (err) <malay>bila teleportation</malay> okay <malay>kononnya tak ada teleportation</malay> [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>kita dah kena</malay> expose more (err) how should I say it (uh) more unknowingly for example <malay>kita naik</malay> <malay>kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport</malay>
<malay>kalau kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>naik</malay> <malay>atau naik</malay> taxi grab driver <malay>ke</malay> taxi driver <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> expose in that (uh) area <malay>kita duduk kat dalam</malay> <malay>ke</malay> <malay>kat dalam kereta ke</malay>
<malay>kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni</malay>
<malay>untuk beberapa minit ini</malay> [ah] <malay>ada yang</malay> research <malay>cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau ada</malay> measure measure <malay>contohnya macam</malay> (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
let's say <malay>nak pergi</malay> giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and I rest at work and exposed again <malay>ini tak boleh kalau kita dah</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kita</malay> skip all the buses <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] all the transportation <malay>ini</malay> exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] <malay>tak kan begitu</malay>
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
<malay>itu haram tu</malay>
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) <malay>banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan</malay> (mm) apa ni orang kata</malay>
<malay>kena pergi kursus</malay> [ah] <malay>kursus-kursus</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer</malay>
<malay>menggunakan aplikasi</malay> word excel <malay>kenapa teknologi telah berubah</malay>
<malay>jadi mereka dah</malay> behind time so <malay>ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin</malay> okay <malay>kut</malay>
okay [lah] [eh] <malay>jap</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> (err)
<malay>saya teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>yang pasal</malay> teleportation [ah] kita (uh) <malay>ni</malay> [eh] reverse <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] <malay>kononnya</malay> teleportation <malay>ni kan boleh kita boleh</malay> teleport
(um) <malay>bila kita umur sepuluh tahun</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira-kira ni macam</malay> so called <malay>macam</malay> time machine <malay>begitu</malay> [ah] (uh) <malay>macam</malay> advance <malay>yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya</malay> invention <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah ada ke tidak ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh</malay> teleport reverse time [eh] maybe <malay>kita</malay> teleport ten years old
<malay>nak cakap apa dengan awak punya</malay> (uh) <malay>diri tu</malay> okay <malay>kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia</malay>
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
(err) <malay>salah satu</malay> (err) experience <malay>yang aku pernah mengalami</malay> [ah] <malay>adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> real [ah]
<malay>dia</malay> (err) it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
<malay>bulu roma ternaik</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku</malay>
<malay>jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga</malay> so (err) <malay>saya tengah bawa macam biasa</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba</malay> (err) <malay>saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan</malay> (err) <malay>di</malay> road <malay>tersebut</malay> [lah] <malay>di jalan raya tersebut</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila saya bawa</malay>
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen <malay>tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja</malay>
<malay>tapi itu pun</malay> okay <malay>itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu adalah</malay> (uh) experience <malay>saya</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> near death experience or rather I would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! <malay>dah macam pantun berkerat</malay>
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
<malay>yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen</malay> (uh) <malay>yang tu semua</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>dia orang kerja</malay> trip
<malay>lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut</malay> number of trip <malay>kalau dia orang</malay>
(err) less trip
<malay>kan kurang</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya</malay> (err) <malay>sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak</malay>
(err) <malay>lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dia punya dia punya alasannya</malay> (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

and you will be comforted
like anyway <malay>pasal buku aku yang aku cakap tadi tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> !hey! <malay>bukan yang buku tu aku cakap buku aku sendiri setan</malay>
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
is that at first <malay>ada satu lelaki ni lelaki ni</malay> something happen to him there's something wrong with him I can't remember what's wrong because it was two years ago when I read it
<malay>tapi sebab dia ada</malay> accident
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
then he met this girl <malay>rambut dia</malay> is like silver <malay>rambut dia</malay> silver <malay>lepas tu dia cantik gila</malay> according to the description
he didn't fell in love at first
he saw the girl and he saw the girl <malay>punya</malay> purse <malay>dalam tu ada</malay> like <malay>berjuta-juta</malay> cash so being like a poor ass human being he stole his her purse he stole then he tried to walk away from her hotel but then he felt bad then he came back and he wanted to take his notebook
and then eventually like they got closer and closer it's like <malay>macam</malay> your basic korean story although it's not korean then after that (um) they did what they had to do and this guy that guy was trying to help the girl from suicide
and then like they help through each other [ah] but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
and it's !oi! <malay>jangan buat bising</malay> [lah]
!oi! it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front [oh] okay I'm sorry I can't remember
remember me

if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
<malay>mana</malay> you need to <malay>pandai cari</malay> [lah] you cannot obviously find those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>apa tu yang</malay> what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself <malay>kalau</malay> shop <malay>tu ada</malay> brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something <malay>yang tak ada</malay> brand <malay>sebab</malay> okay if I tell you (um) chanel
a bag from chanel or a <malay>baju</malay> from chanel and a <malay>baju</malay> from H&M but it's the same exact <malay>baju</malay> it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then
<malay>kau tidur ke</malay>
<malay>abeh tak nak layan</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay>
(ugh) I don't want friend you anymore

and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also <malay>suka bilik mak aku</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>bilik mak aku</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dia dah</malay> romantic mood

[ah] <malay>sebab kau</malay> [kan] vampire
<malay>tingkap pun tak nak buka</malay>
<malay>asal kau tak nak buka tingkap</malay>
so your house is like just <malay>dua tingkat</malay> you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the <malay>tingkap</malay> near your <malay>bilik</malay> it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
<malay>tapi</malay> our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
<malay>tu</malay> the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful <malay>macam</malay> bacterias in the air and then <malay>keluarkan</malay> the cool air
I cannot understand <malay>punya</malay> fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
[oh] wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby #jungkook# now he's so !aww!
he has like !wow! I know him <malay>badan dia</malay> like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ</malay>
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
!oi!
why
why not
I'm not saying maisonette is like <malay>atas bawah</malay> [tau] <malay>rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu</malay>
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it <malay>macam</malay> you want your own space
why [oh] because you just live in your room [eh] <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>dah terbiasa gitu</malay> [lah] [oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
so [ah] <malay>rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun</malay>
(uh huh) <malay>atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku</malay> P three
<malay>cerita dia pasal kampung</malay> girl [a'ah] <malay>dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay>
and then it got really complicated <malay>aku tak pernah habis baca sebab</malay> I find the character so cringey
and it's like <malay>macam</malay> about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but <malay>aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa</malay> she would like it I guess
[ah] about <malay>apa</malay> don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> even the like okay so that day I ask her like
I don't know what I ask her [ah] and after that she suddenly said like her mum [ah] did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like [oh] then why why is she not working because I legit ask [ah] out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said [ah]
what [ah] to <malay>jaga</malay> her <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very #atas# lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle [kan] it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
like that time <malay>ada</malay> thing but then in the end she managed to go also [pe]
ya [lah] <malay>ngok</malay>
ya
ya
I mean
why
<malay>apa dia</malay>
serious [ah] <malay>asal</malay>
[ah] <malay>selalu gitu</malay> [oh] my god girl you want me to get started on christina and #ulfa# [eh] no <malay>salah nama</malay> christina and #insha#
so you don't know #insha# and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] however the thing with #insha# is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird <malay>sebab macam</malay> it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team [lah] I would have like shouted at her but then [oh] my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
and like <malay>macam</malay> okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like <malay>macam</malay> you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay #insha# did to christina so on like
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on #insha# story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then [ah]
she she said that <malay>macam kalau</malay> in terms of <malay>apa</malay>
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina <malay>tapi</malay> ya that's not how it is
<malay>dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar</malay> together they did a double date <malay>lepas tu azhari</malay> didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why #azhari# didn't pay for it but then #akif# paid for it like christina <malay>punya</malay> boyfriend he paid for <malay>insha punya</malay> cable car ride
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
<malay>sot tak sot</malay> [sia]
[oh] so annoying okay end of ranting session <malay>aku nak jadi macam</malay> zookeeper

okay hi #azli# yes and we both of us are (um) married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
(uh) twenty nine but I <malay>tak terjun botol punya orang</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't know because that time I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>terjun botol</malay> when you actually (uh) proposed to me right I <malay>rasa macam</malay> like the happiest girl on earth [lor] then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam semak</malay> because the thing is that (um) it's not very often for me to get (um)
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like <malay>macam</malay> those people who idiots people [lah] but then (uh)
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say [oh] automatically I said yes [one] so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like [ah] because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
(uh) condo credit card car and whatever the C [lah] but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like (um) like what you want to do when we get married
will be like [oh] no this one [lah]
he cannot I already [mah] so you say that you end up
so when that time when (um) it was my turn right (um) I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like (um) does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually (um) proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up [ah] that time we were already like twenty seven I think
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old !wah! <malay>sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi</malay> [ha] ya so
I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I think this the right time for us to get married
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like (uh) knows (um) a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
[ha] decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah]
because of the and the right that one all (um) we we prepare ourselves yes (uh) I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
(uh) we all all our by ourself [lah]
but remember that time we <malay>kena kena tipu</malay>
the for our <malay>kad jemputan</malay>
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like (um) they say it in (um)
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them [ah] then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think (uh) we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars [eh] I was about to fork out everything [eh] to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't [eh] I was actually thanks to
to your mother also [lah] from actually stopped me also <malay>mak mak</malay> stopped me
ya because I trust them so much
but then (uh) at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because (uh) it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give [lah] but that time
[ah] ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways (uh) it actually works I print exactly [lah] that's why [ah] you got extra correct so that time
so (uh) eventually after that we that's not the only problem [ah] during our wedding [ah] actually my greatest fear for (uh)
I actually [oh] the next one the problem was (uh) the <malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>tak nak nyanyi</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak</malay> show up we got the best [tau] he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
quite popular in #suria# also and (uh) he's one of the funniest guy [ah] I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out !alah!
ya wasted [sia] it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like !walao! not on my wedding [lah] [sia]
!huh! ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer [lah] then that caterer also say (um) I don't know [lah] he's like that [lah] the <malay>perangai macam apa</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I was like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>merepek</malay> [seh] <malay>perangai</malay>
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude <malay>macam</malay> #siak# so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) eventually I
call I I try to find <malay>kat</malay> facebook <malay>tengok ada tak siapa-siapa</malay> so I found
but before our wedding there was this (uh) issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free [lah] contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better [eh] best [eh] until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also (uh) still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel [lah] so shout out to #azuri# and then (um)
ya our our wedding take place #azuri# #azur# but (uh) the his name is #azuri#
okay
so ya okay so
then that [kan] so all the <malay>lagu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>ada lagu melayu semua</malay> all <malay>mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus</malay> (uh) <malay>baju semua</malay> awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
the whatever [kan] <malay>semua tak</malay> show up <malay>tak apa tapi</malay> caterer <malay>kalau tak</malay> show up !wah!
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that <malay>makanan apa</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa</malay> maggi <malay>mee</malay>
ya
is very much (um)
ya <malay>macam</malay> [lah]
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy (err) better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya I mean (um) he he <malay>dia</malay> very professional [lah] professional <malay>dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu</malay> and <malay>dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun</malay> for [ah] because the reason is that my mum is under religious <malay>punya</malay> school studies so <malay>kalau</malay>
so <malay>kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti</malay> my mum was like [eh] don't open like all these kind of song [ah]
[ha] so <malay>macam</malay> he understand like throughout truly [lah] everything <malay>semua dia faham semua</malay> so the was good
(uh) eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer <malay>datang</malay> we got our photoshoot photographs <malay>semua</malay>
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes <malay>kita punya</malay> video <malay>tak dapat balik</malay> so orang lain (um) <malay>tunjukkan</malay> video <malay>kat</malay> facebook after like what
two weeks <malay>kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan</malay> video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
ya
yes correct then the things that <malay>bila</malay> I that's when I found out that <malay>macam</malay>
(um) actually I don't really care [lah] that's it's correct [lah] <malay>macam sedih kita tak dapat</malay> video <malay>tapi</malay> at that same time I say
video could be just a story then <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>nak cerita</malay> I <malay>dengan</malay> you like forever <malay>punya cerita</malay> video so I say okay
I want to get my own video <malay>tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat</malay> because my computer very slow
ya I know <malay>banyak tapi</malay> video (um) computer slow the things that all <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> the computer <malay>baru datang baru boleh buat</malay>
okay so ya make it a drive all right so (um) is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage [ah] the wedding [ah]
[oh] ya the weather it was nice [ah]
(mm)
<malay>cuaca</malay>
ya the <malay>cuaca</malay> was nice because <malay>dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun</malay> so it was just that perfect moment
ya
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding (um) because that wedding [kan] (um) I like my wedding <malay>betul</malay> but
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom <malay>punya</malay> wedding right is like <malay>terbaik</malay> [ah] <malay>pada</malay> I (um) shout to #shah ibrahim# he make it like <malay>macam</malay> it's like a hotel
<malay>tapi</malay> still <malay>macam tak</malay> hotel <malay>juga</malay> parking is the perfect place to park the car because <malay>apa ni kat mana</malay> [eh]
[kan] #tanjong katong# complex yes so that place was <malay>macam</malay> #tanjong katong# complex where <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) what is called ya (mm) ya <malay>dia punya</malay> parking is open space it's there's lot of parking <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> parking <malay>pun</malay> you can still park at #wisma# you can still park at
#hooga# [eh] <malay>salah</malay> group <malay>punya</malay> side <malay>banyak tempat untuk</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> and then when I ask my friend because (um) I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there <malay>semua cakap makan</malay> and everything is just cost like less [eh]
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like <malay>macam</malay> that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like <malay>macam</malay> if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> one thing about bad about that place it's not bad [lah] I say <malay>macam</malay>
not that fantastic about that place is just that <malay>dia punya tempat nak tukar baju</malay> and everything (mm)
[ah] yes because the things that <malay>macam</malay> okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as <malay>apa kita tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali</malay>
[eh]
ya around two to three right (uh) some ours was three ya ours was three [eh] no the <malay>sanding</malay> was two and then the <malay>nikah</malay> was one but <malay>nikah</malay> was a day before
so <malay>macam kita kita macam</malay> !wah! get married and then [ah] one thing about ya that one is just that [ah]
and then <malay>dapat</malay> hotel <malay>semua</malay> my friend actually (uh) because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> because wedding malay weddings like <malay>kelam-kabut nak mampus</malay> [leh] <malay>bukan bukan</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you [dah] you <malay>nak tukar baju</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding</malay>
<malay>sekali macam</malay> you <malay>nak kena naik kereta</malay> go to the hotel just to <malay>tukar baju</malay> and then go back there so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] traffic and then <malay>campur</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay> make up <malay>semua</malay> and then <malay>nak kena pakai baju semua</malay> so eventually that one [ah] take process up to two to three hours [eh]
the hours [eh] maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to !alah! <malay>dah cukup datang</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak juga pasal kalau nak buat</malay> photoshoot <malay>tak ada</malay> time <malay>mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>semua orang nak ambil gambar</malay> that time semua [ha] <malay>selit sikit</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> that's the only <malay>macam</malay> if for orange ballroom [ah] but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary <malay>kita buat</malay> wedding <malay>lagi</malay>
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum <malay>punya dia akan suka</malay> okay about malay wedding [eh]
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or <malay>terpaksa</malay> like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like [eh] you got child <malay>ni</malay> you got child some more [ah]
!walao! I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] <malay>makcik ni</malay>
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually <malay>dia orang cuma ingat yang</malay> my mum <malay>cuma ada</malay> my brother and sister my <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
cause my brother my <malay>kakak</malay> is the only people who are like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>terserlah</malay> I me and my <malay>adik kita orang macam</malay> relax [ah] <malay>kita orang</malay> relax chill <malay>lepak</malay> bro <malay>tak buat apa-apa semua kita</malay> relax <malay>tak macam</malay>
my sister and my brother [ha] <malay>kita memang</malay> low profile relax [ah] relax like like you <malay>juga</malay> [kan] you <malay>pun</malay> relax <malay>tak buat apa-apa juga macam</malay>

(mm)

we did say to (uh) my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there <malay>kalau</malay> I was there <malay>macam</malay> over

so confirm I <malay>dah gaduh dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dah tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> K what if K <malay>takpe</malay> next question (uh) just asking you what is the luckiest or like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
(um) thank god that time one one thing is the <malay>cuaca</malay> [kan] <malay>cuaca cuaca</malay> was like perfect [ah] okay then another thing <malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>suka pasal</malay> that wedding
(mm)
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing [ah] for you [ah] for me the luckiest will be the photo [ah] no no not the photography the photography was good [ah] the no ya
the other guy I mean my friend <malay>punya</malay>
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing [ah] that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
I feel like <malay>macam</malay> that is the most the best thing [ah] of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about <malay>tak boleh makan</malay> or can <malay>makan</malay> also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know [ah] maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually [ah] <malay>menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak</malay> [ha] <malay>dah kahwin pun</malay> [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau tak</malay> then I I I I still okay so <malay>takpe</malay> okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of (um) crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
<malay>lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya cara</malay> you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my <malay>makcik cakap</malay> auntie lisa [lah] she told me that
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
<malay>orang ketiga ke apa</malay> #alhamdulillah# I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no <malay>orang ketiga</malay>
[kan] ya so just to ask you again but (um)
we go through like a lot of stuff [lah] eventually until now even though it's
it's almost six years already (um) we are not (uh) blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with (uh) being with you [lah] okay so (um) <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak tanya</malay> you what was on your mind
okay (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kahwin</malay> okay once you <malay>dah habis</malay>
all the <malay>nikah</malay> right and then (um) all the <malay>sanding semua dah habis</malay> [kan] and then outside then (um) <malay>kat dalam bilik</malay> <malay>dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur</malay> [kan]
but what was on your mind [eh] <malay>dalam otak</malay> you <malay>tu apa</malay> you <malay>fikir macam</malay> it was for me like I <malay>fikir macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku dah kahwin</malay> [lah] [seh]
<malay>aku dah aku dah</malay> I'm like all these responsibilities <malay>macam</malay> !fuh! [dah] jatuh kat kat</malay> I [lah] then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> [eh] I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] like like really I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] I <malay>tak sangka</malay> I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> and then [ah] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>takpe</malay> #lek# even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> [oh] wait wait wait <malay>kau dah kahwin</malay>
okay so that was like (uh) that but it wasn't a big thing yet [ah] [ah] but for you what what's on your mind <malay>bila</malay>
you <malay>bila</malay> all this <malay>dah habis</malay> [kan] and the <malay>sanding</malay> part <malay>semua dah habis</malay> what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya
ya then like because the thing is that (uh) okay regarding about the call right <malay>dia macam mana</malay> [tau]
because the thing is that <malay>kalau</malay> you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home <malay>ke tak</malay>
[ah] not because (um) <malay>curang ke apa</malay> [lah] [ha] but it's more to like <malay>macam</malay> (um) like you <malay>pukul berapa nak balik</malay> I mean like worried [tau] worried (uh) you you also did because the thing is that
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dah jadi isteri</malay>
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
where are you <malay>tu semua</malay> and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like <malay>macam kalau malam</malay> alone not that good [lah] [kan] cause it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good [lah] thank god we've got a good neighbourhood [ah] but no people like any tom dick or harry <malay>ke apa ke</malay> you call <malay>dia orang nak</malay> strike strike <malay>malam apa betul tak</malay>
[ha] so I <malay>tak suka</malay> [lah] [kan]
then (um) so another thing is like respect [lah] also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you [ah] <malay>bila</malay> [eh] you <malay>ni bila nak balik ni semua</malay> then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya <malay>tapi</malay> there's the I mean mostly you like about that [lah] [ah] but one thing about him like you <malay>tak kasih</malay> I you <malay>kasih</malay> I <malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>kebebasan</malay> also so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> happy [lah] [ha] so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind [lah] like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out [lah] yang <malay>kita ni ada banyak kesamaan</malay> in terms of like movies
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
ya and then like <malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) marvels (uh)
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like <malay>macam</malay> harry potter you don't like <malay>tapi</malay> (um) lord of the ring you like and then
(um) some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
(err) so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] give and take [ah] stuff like that (uh) then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
is travelling [kan]
<malay>tak sama serupa</malay>
(mm)
ya
!chey! that was a punishment though
[eh]
<malay>jap</malay> at that time you <malay>belum apa</malay> at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
I don't know [eh] [oh] I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me [ah] I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry [ah] because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
meticulous [lah] <malay>macam semua benda</malay> I <malay>mesti macam</malay> make sure that everything [eh] <malay>mesti macam</malay>
goes well [lah] (uh) because I <malay>punya orang tak macam itu</malay> [tau] I <malay>punya orang tak macam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak jadi pergi sini</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] due to this and that and this and that I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>rasa risau</malay> [ha] but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day [eh] <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] on that time we actually had fun [eh] [ha] better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu <malay>macam tak</malay> plan <malay>apa</malay> and <malay>lepas tu kita terus</malay> like (uh) okay just dive [ah]
<malay>kita pergi</malay> cameron and port dickson
<malay>duit ada</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> okay I <malay>terjun</malay> [jer] [ah] [ha] so it was <malay>macam</malay> it was fun [lah] it was fun <malay>kita pergi</malay> honeymoon <malay>tu semua</malay> and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then (uh) travel then
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also [lah]
(uh) then he he can drive well [ha] <malay>naik atas semua</malay> and then because that one also is my first time I went out to (um) holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone <malay>ke pergi dengan kawan ke</malay> or <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>apa tak pernah</malay> my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>orang lain dah siapkan dah</malay>
no [lah] but then but
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] [ah] but one thing is just like it's just fun [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's it's one thing like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! [dah] [dah] start into responsibility end up okay <malay>dah tahu macam mana nak</malay> book hotel <malay>tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis</malay> stop <malay>tak</malay> <malay>asyik</malay> book hotel [jer] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday [jer]
ya
actually <malay>ada banyak juga</malay> for #bandung# but <malay>ada tapi kita tak tak</malay> venture <malay>ke sana</malay> [lah]
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then (um) like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
I regret <malay>tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin</malay> but then again I <malay>rasa</malay> this is still the right time because the thing is that
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that (um) we wanted to do [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam kita tak boleh buat macam</malay> (uh) and then (um) but then again after I <malay>dah berapa tahun yang</malay> I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people <malay>punya</malay> kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the time I I
I <malay>macam suka ikut-ikut orang</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ni ada</malay> bag dior I <malay>pun nak</malay> bag [ah] <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak pun nak</malay> I I <malay>pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat</malay> cafe <malay>ni semua</malay> but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding [lah] our wedding supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that <malay>dia orang suka</malay> (um)
they do their own way marriage [lah]
[ah] so that's why [lah]
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so (um)
can I just ask you another question [ah] before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me [lah]
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and !hey! you <malay>jangan cakap</malay> you <malay>pun tak ada</malay> flaws <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] [ha] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example [kan] <malay>macam kalau dulu</malay> you <malay>tahu kalau</malay> before <malay>kahwin</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kalau tak kalau</malay> you <malay>kahwin</malay> you can play endless car <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but (um)
after marriage maybe you find like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena layan dia ni</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana</malay> I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets [ah]
(mm)
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding [oh] <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [ha] <malay>macam</malay> for me [kan] I <malay>tak</malay> regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but (uh) <malay>macam</malay> being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married [ah] [ah] but one thing about you you don't you don't let <malay>macam</malay> [ah] give me to <malay>kongkong</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that [kan] [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> I freedom of what to do like for example even this (uh) recording screen <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
some people will find it <malay>macam</malay> the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give [ha] so <malay>macam</malay> it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really <malay>macam</malay> into it [lah]
[ha] <malay>cakap nanti berselerak</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah</malay> [lah] [kan] so so eventually <malay>macam</malay> not all guys can actually accept this [ah] so actually one thing I I happy [lah] I <malay>dapat kahwin dengan</malay> you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it <malay>macam</malay> funny [ah] because that time I wasn't planning [mah] to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking [eh] this guy okay or not [ha]
eventually he is like one okay guy [lah] so okay [lor] okay last question
last question [lah] I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me [ah]
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding [ah] marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
I I <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau</malay> you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity (uh) I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault [ah] it's your fault but then (um) there's no such thing as #tercheat# [ah]
#ter# #ter# there's no such thing as that one for for what I know [lah]
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me [lah]
[ha] if you do have another girl outside or what then (um) that was one of my biggest fear [lah] I have I don't have like small small fear but then <malay>macam</malay> that one I think that if that happen <malay>terus</malay> cut [ah]
[ah] and also <malay>pukul</malay> [lah] but then I there wasn't any hit or anything [ah] I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything [lah] (uh) so (um) okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
(uh) like for example anything [ah] that you think like <malay>ada ke apa</malay> biggest fear [lah]
ya correct [ah] then about (uh) then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people [ah] that one
(uh) never give me stress also because like the thing is that (um) in-laws right
some in-laws [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me <malay>macam</malay> I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum <malay>ke apa</malay> and then your mum don't like me <malay>akan cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [sia] [eh] sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [ha] [dah] [lah] <malay>gemuk tak lawa tu semua</malay> but then it's like
not like that [ah] your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually (um) (uh) <malay>apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua</malay> so we were like
okay [lah] still got we we there was a bond there [ha] and now (uh) we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
(uh) we want to create our own family here [lah] [ha]
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future (um) request
as a husband towards me for
featuring guest [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (uh)
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years [lah] we are already in our
six years and then <malay>macam kalau</malay> you want to have another what what what is your no request [lah] what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year <malay>punya</malay> anniversary ya
[oh] my god do I know this
okay I think (uh) because (um) for the last past five months [eh] five years I have been like driving you crazy [kan] okay the thing is that (um)
okay [ah] I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family [lah] like another (um) junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that (uh) another person [ah] in our family [lah] [kan]
[ha] to join us <malay>apa semua tu</malay> so I wish that <malay>kita</malay> our financial also is doing good and everything and then (um) healthier family and also (um) slimmer but until now also [dah] five years also still not slim so
ya [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] just just saying only
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so (um) I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually (uh) know
about you more [lah]
because of the time [lah] if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that (uh) to me
I like cooking [lah] not really into cleaning up [ah] he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya [kan]
okay so (um) that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

[ah] uni at is that premium
so it's just a one year course so ya
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so <malay>macam</malay> and I feel that <malay>lagi senang</malay> [ah]
ya
one year
ya just one year
one year and is only for like a forty K
forty K including the food and the house
ya ya but then weekly need to pay around like (um) eight hundred weekly [ah] for the rent yes yes ya correct
including [ah] including their school fees and stuff ya four thousand but it's actually okay [ah]
ya
ya but it's a more of a countryside <malay>punya tempat</malay> (mm) so okay [lah] there's no distractions I think
ya so what are you gonna do like like stick in this job
are you thinking of upgrading yourself
[oh] ya how long how long you have you work
(oo) that's fast
are you planning to change to what industry
[oh] ya but now also not the time to change cause of COVID
ya correct
ya correct there's no job
[oh] ya ya a lot of people are looking into (um) childcare jobs
ya
ya correct you have to take the course
you can take part time I don't know if it's subsidised or something it is it
<malay>tak tahu ke kakak kau</malay>
[oh] [oh] the or the swag yes correct correct [oh]
[oh]
worth it [lah] because it's for long term like for until you die [what] you hold that cert
[oh] the
P C or something is it (uh huh) [oh] you wait until you are twenty five day then you can get the
the work and learn shit I don't know [ah] what is it
(uh) okay then you can upgrade yourself [what] then
(mmhmm)
(um)
but what if they don't upgrade you you know now is not the time for promotion or
no increment [lah]
[oh]
admin you know admin actually
actually is a really a good job because like <malay>dekat</malay> that time intern <malay>tempat</malay> intern <malay>aku</malay> bourbon
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> admin earn <malay>berapa</malay>
two point five thousand yes they earn a lot
ya no because I think you see industry <malay>mana</malay> [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau kau</malay> should search in
maritime <malay>punya</malay> admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just <malay>duduk</malay> office and just (um)
they just sit office and book flights for the managers just simple admin stuff like or the food cause my
friend is admin <malay>dekat</malay> maritime that time <malay>dekat</malay> bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
which admin which department
because depends on department like my friend is a admin for like (err) department admin
so like she's like the receptionist
so so like when you enter she's there
(uh) ya don't have the more so but then now she move on to a better job that job offers her two point seven now
under law <malay>punya</malay> admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin <malay>macam</malay> registration <malay>orang nak masuk</malay>
register order nothing nothing about law cause it's just admin work like the you know
those work that people don't want to do <malay>macam</malay> filing and stuff
ya
yup
ya but nevermind you can just now like gain experience then you can go for senior admin ya correct
then people ya
ya I mean is very tough [ah]
what
<malay>tua</malay>
okay new doctor is easy to handle because they don't do anything [what] you can like okay doctor okay doctor
why
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
okay but then okay [lah] working with new doctors they tend to depend on you which is better
<malay>pasal</malay> [sia]
whose fault is that is your fault [what] it's the doctor's [what] [oh] X-ray [oh]
I mean then you talk to the head X-ray department [lah]
so ya
I haven't send in my petition but I already got the form I mean I still have time
I have still have time to march [ah] to think about it to I mean to go bank also to <malay>minta</malay> loan study loon and stuff
I haven't go buy thing during my holidays my next holiday is december then I can go banks but bank now the loan rate is very low because of their bad economy so these is good and a bad thing [ah]
now is like I'm like [ah] whatever just go [lor] because even if I go now there's no job maritime job for me
of course right now I think I'm like
whatever like just do it no because I just
like a news so <malay>macam</malay> like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers <malay>kena buang</malay> [sia]
retrenched <malay>macam</malay> because the economy was busted [sia]
but ya because <malay>aku</malay> like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
ya that's life ya that's why ya correct correct
nothing is certain [sia] now like
(mm) correct
alright
ya I'm not ready to be no adulthood [lah] so I think I should study one more year
master
if because master in is also one year usually master takes like a lot of years like maybe three years if I'm not wrong I'm not sure
while uni in singapore is four years
(um) degree first their master then PhD uni is degree
then they way to continue [ah] if you got the money
[ah] if I got the money I guess or maybe I will work first and then I take my master part time
until PhD I don't know if
there's a will there's a way <malay>betul</malay>
so ya [lah] so I'm after my career now so
cause there's nothing is certain [lah]
[ah] ya correct so
ya [lah]
ya like ya
correct
but !hais! such as life
(mm)

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[sial] [lah]
[a'ah]
<malay>cerita apa cerita apa</malay>
[orh]
normal [ah]
so at the end of the day pun different <malay>orang tengok lain</malay> [pe]
so <malay>macam</malay> upon <malay>macam</malay> texts <malay>pun sama</malay>
<malay>macam kalau aku cakap</malay> [sial] [lah] <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau baca</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni maki aku</malay> [pe] [sial]
<malay>tapi kalau aku aku cakap</malay> in a very playful way
it's just perspective [ah] you know
<malay>kalau kau tengok macam kau punya</malay> thoughts <malay>macam gitu</malay> then <malay>kau fikir cara gitu</malay> then
how can can you blame me [sia] <malay>aku</malay> say in a very cannot blame me [ah]
[orh]
[orh]
(mm)
non-stop [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] <malay>dorang ada</malay> record <malay>macam</malay> some <malay>dorangnya</malay>
talk [ah] <malay>sedih</malay> [sia]
<malay>pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia</malay> [sia] <malay>kau yang</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku tak tumbuk kau</malay> [sia] I mean like <malay>kau tumbuk aku</malay>
<malay>kau tak cakap abeh</malay> amber <malay>macam aku pukul kau</malay> [jer] [pe]
<malay>kau</malay>
[ah]
<malay>abeh kau campak</malay>
pots and pans <malay>kau campak</malay> vase
like <malay>tak salah ke tu salah</malay> [seh] <malay>kau tahu</malay>
<malay>macam aku ada</malay> listen to few tips <malay>orang kahwin</malay> [ah] <malay>orang dah kahwin cakap</malay>
sometimes the person that you marry is not the same person that you get in the relationship with
then that's why it makes sense <malay>bila dia cakap</malay>
<malay>kan selalu cakap</malay> stephen [kan]
<malay>buat apa kau nak</malay> relationship <malay>lama-lama</malay>
in the end <malay>asal kau nak</malay> a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
<malay>kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih</malay> [sia] <malay>kalau</malay> yet to find out
<malay>macam apa ni</malay> the person that <malay>kau sukakan</malay> and then <malay>bila korang kahwin</malay> is just a different person
but
<malay>abeh korang</malay> stuck [tau] you are stuck there don't know like <malay>kalau aku tinggal</malay>
<malay>ni</malay> thing <malay>aku salah bila aku</malay> let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this [sia]
like there's
like I really <malay>dia</malay> just stuck [sia]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh]
correct
strangers [ah] at the end of the day
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> always believe this phrase <malay>macam</malay> doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like <malay>tak semestinya kita boleh</malay> vibe <malay>macam</malay> [eh] but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like <malay>aku boleh kita</malay> like <malay>boleh macam</malay>
[ah] people always said like !wah! if I can vibe with you okay okay but [sial] [lah] that is just a touch <malay>atau</malay> it's a two different things [seh]
whether you're not <malay>kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia</malay> and like accept who she is that's a different thing [sia]
so <malay>untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh</malay> vibe <malay>dengan kau</malay> it's a
it's not good it's a very
biased one-sided [ah]
it's not <malay>macam</malay> it's not cause you can't true
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is it cause of the
<malay>dia nya</malay> expectations or
(mm)
that's why <malay>aku takut aku tak</malay> understand about <malay>aku nya</malay> self especially
like sometimes <malay>aku suka orang ni</malay> then <malay>aku akan</malay> go for her
but [kan] <malay>bila dah</malay> at the stage <malay>macam boleh aku</malay> just <malay>cabut diri</malay>
<malay>untuk aku</malay> is like <malay>tak</malay> one thing is commitment [ah] <malay>macam</malay> the commitment of having someone to <malay>jaga</malay> is <malay>untuk aku</malay> really <malay>takut untuk aku</malay>
ya <malay>aku nya</malay> reason why <malay>aku aku</malay> understand this part of me [eh] <malay>aku cakap</malay> reason why <malay>aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh</malay> but it's just that
<malay>dah</malay> a few times <malay>aku</malay> try and then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>cabut</malay>
like <malay>aku</malay> just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up [ah] like
just ghost her <malay>atau</malay>
ya so like sometimes <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>macam bingit</malay> [ah] <malay>macam takde</malay> then you know like I want something but <malay>bila dah ada nanti aku</malay> just <malay>cabut</malay>
so I always remind myself <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul</malay> then go for it [ah] if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day <malay>kau akan cabut juga</malay> [pe] at the end of the day <malay>kalau kau tak suka dia</malay>
so ya
that's why that time <malay>kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kawan kau yang yang kerja</malay> nurse [eh] part-time
<malay>siapa</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tanya takde mata air macam tak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam asal entah</malay> [eh] <malay>terus aku terus cam teringat</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> like
<malay>aku kalau ada ada</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's just that at the end of the day <malay>aku cabut</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh]
ya <malay>pasal</malay>
(mm)
<malay>untuk aku pun itu</malay> is a different way of (err) <malay>camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
it's a different way of <malay>macam kita</malay> own body <malay>ada</malay> own mechanics [ah]
the reason why <malay>macam aku dengan kau</malay> is always <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>diam dulu</malay> then <malay>nanti baru gerek</malay> is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like <malay>dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak</malay> [leh] <malay>ngam</malay> then why not why for what <malay>aku</malay> waste <malay>akunya</malay> time
<malay>kalau dia punya dia punya</malay> mindset is <malay>macam</malay> I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest [lah] that kind of mindset [ah] but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam apa ni</malay> you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
ya how to say
to throw away [ah] to waste [ah] ya
is this a is this a Twitter specifically for
romanticism <malay>atau</malay> all the stuff
[orh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>ya</malay> [lah] I understand
to be cause at the end of the day right
one thing <malay>dorang</malay> been <malay>berbual pasal</malay> gender role <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang sendiri</malay> confused with their own gender role this kind of thing <malay>untuk aku lelaki</malay> shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait [lah] I would say
so <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>macam</malay> sweet stuff
is it it has to be balanced [what] yin and yang
so the guy basically provides and
all the <malay>macam</malay> masculine stuff the girl of course have to be <malay>kalau dua-dua</malay> side <malay>macam</malay> family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance [ah] then after that's when <malay>nanti dorang dah</malay> complain [oh] <malay>dia ni</malay> annoying [ah] <malay>gini gini gini</malay>
cause they already have too much
like you eat too much sweets <malay>sakit tekak</malay> [pe]
<malay>apa</malay>
based of perspective [one] [ah]
<malay>kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun</malay> sweet [pe]
<malay>dia tak buat apa-apa pun</malay> sweet <malay>abeh kalau laki tu macam</malay> he's not your type
<malay>asal pula aku kena panggil</malay> creep
<malay>ya</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
that's <malay>untuk aku</malay> there's no such thing [ah]
cause the scariest part [kan] <malay>macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan</malay> this someone [kan]
how sure are you that this twenty four hour <malay>otak dia</malay> is <malay>bedek bedek</malay>
<malay>bila kita tengah main</malay> [kan] <malay>aku boleh</malay> imagine someone else <malay>asal kau tak boleh</malay> imagine someone else confirm <malay>kau boleh</malay> imagine someone else [pe] but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
toxic
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that that's why the misconcept of <malay>macam</malay>
there's no connection
cause of that feeling
like [oh] <malay>takde</malay> connect then they <malay>cakap</malay> to make it in a very layman <malay>dengan</malay> very
to see that they are smart <malay>atau</malay> they can feel all these [oh] <malay>takde</malay> connection [ah]
there's no connection between us just cause they don't
feel orgasm [ah] scientifically [lah] like you know
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
assumption [ah]
(mmhmm)
happen [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
<malay>asal</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] <malay>lagi</malay>
thirty seconds <malay>nak tidur</malay> <malay>nak tidur</malay>
(err) you want me to countdown
eight nine eight seven six five four three two one
happy new year

(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni</malay> mystery shopper that was many years back [lah] then after that (uh) the I only did once
because (uh) <malay>lepas tu</malay> like there's no job and nobody call me [lah] I did the [ah] <malay>aku pernah buat yang apa yang</malay> shopping <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
I did the one for (uh) one of the retailers in singapore [lah] but I have to go it's a it's a one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [tau] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan]
(uh) it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's (uh) the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer [lah]
then (uh) I have there's a whole checklist of things [lah] that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
one of the important one is the customer service [ah] because they are rating customer service <malay>punya</malay> survey
so you actually depends [ah] <malay>macam</malay> when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things (err) they are looking out for
and then (err) ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) after that they never call me [oh] for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> product is
(err) groceries she have to go to a few (uh) supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing (uh) all within her area
then (uh) she's given one product so it actually varies <malay>macam kau buat</malay> (uh) mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like (err) basic necessity <malay>macam</malay> for your home
so it can be like anything [lah] depends on the product they are doing the survey for
but (uh) my friend one is quite interesting <malay>dia pergi</malay> <malay>dia buat pasal</malay> (uh) food product [ah] I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
<malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> (uh) <malay>dia kena pergi</malay> (uh) two or three no three or four different (err) supermarket
to actually (err)
(err) do a survey on the product pricing
so it depends [ah] <malay>macam mana kau punya</malay> what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] [sia] upfront
(mm)
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result [lah] responses [ah]
so it's your own free time <malay>bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila</malay> once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
ya it's quite fast <malay>cuma</malay> (uh) they will give you a deadline [lah] by this date <malay>kau kena</malay> submit back come back to the office and submit [ah]
<malay>lama</malay> [seh] but I think that time was not hundred [ah] less than that
but it was just like say (uh) one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more [lah] three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred [lah] is only but it's the pay is good [lah] for that time
(mm) assignment <malay>tapi</malay> the assignment (uh) <malay>dia kasih macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay>
outlet [kan] then (um)
the one the ya then the questions is all similar [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> three different outlet <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> outlet A outlet B outlet C <malay>lepas tu</malay> the questions are the same [ah]
ya
(uh) price about it it's the same [lah] because it's the same retailer [pe]
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that <malay>macam berselerak ke ataupun</malay> very neat always very neat
and then (err) I had (uh) my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper [lah] like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience [eh]
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything [what] at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so (err) it was interesting then after that (err)
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them [lah] then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya [lah] but then no choice [what] and then is this this is like (uh) you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also (uh)
they they know that mean their their company already inform them [lah] like
maybe informed the manager [lah] not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
(uh) [eh] this date this or this week right got this date this time (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> surveyor coming
that kind of thing [lah] they don't say like mystery shopper [lah] maybe surveyor [lah]
[ah] they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one (uh) (uh) a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
(mm)
then too bad [lah] then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
so it's like (uh) consistency [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know [lah] that this week (uh) got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
(uh) customer service you know that they can give but then (uh) other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that [lor]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
one year [eh]
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
it's like part time [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> like the working hours how
[oh]
!wow!
okay
(mm)
<malay>cuma</malay> it's like quite far [lah] I mean (uh) I think I feel like it's quite far <malay>tapi</malay> three times a week okay [what] [ah]
(mm)
just nice
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah]
(mm)
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
(mm)
ya but
!wah! that's nothing new [lah] because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] but I heard that the pay is quite good you know (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
and then like (uh) my friend was saying [ah] like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good [lah]
ya [lah] no it's more than ten I think
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like <malay>macam</malay> dormitories [eh] the they can even pay up to <malay>macam</malay> I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend (uh) and my friend was saying [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> like (uh) she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
(mm)
true [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
(mm)
[oh]
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance [ah] like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
ya [lah]
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
(mmhmm)
!huh!
[ah]
!wow! lucky [sia]
(hmm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh] ya
ya [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] like they have to save cost [lah] if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like (uh) reduce the
the
the rental right ya [lor]
(mm) (mm)
why
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so interesting
(mm)
[oh]
[ah] okay
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>rumah dia berapa bilik</malay> [seh]
[oh]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah] that's smart
ya [lah]
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah] ya [lah] true
(mm)
[oh] he's staying alone now is it
(mm)
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
(mm)
ya [lah] true
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm)
but it's good [lah] I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
(mm) it's so far it's still okay [lah] we don't have any pay cut <malay>tapi macam</malay>
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) like how long can we <malay>tahan</malay> like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical [lah]
so like (uh) and then plus being in the fintech [kan] <malay>macam</malay> don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
and then (uh) we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in [eh]
then (uh) like other products <malay>macam</malay> very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
and
ya [lah] I mean rumours have been going around [lah] it's better to look for something else but again in this situation <malay>macam mana nak cari</malay> [seh]
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see [lah] like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
<malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> right now like right now I'm still okay [lah] I still have a job [what] but then
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then (uh) don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking [lah] but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin [ah] so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and (uh) and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel (uh) travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know [lah] but my whole company is like they freeze travel [lah]
so I was like [eh] when I look at linkedin I was like [eh] <malay>ada</malay> [eh] <malay>orang masih nak masih nak cari ni</malay> [ah]
like for to do travel booking [lah] visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing [lah] basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter [eh]
from like [ah] [ah] headhunter agency [eh] no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[kan] I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight [ah] I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got (uh) really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya [lor] makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is (uh) four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can [lah] #wei# cause (uh) like more senior level [lah] like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky [lah] they get a very easy boss
with
[eh] you never know you know my previous company there's this one (err) (uh) E old she's not just senior she's also old
<malay>dia jaga macam</malay> (uh) one of the creative (uh) asia pacific <malay>punya</malay> director [eh] APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas <malay>pergi</malay> overseas <malay>punya</malay> office [kan]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do [lah]
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
basically <malay>aku tengok macam</malay>
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
I was like [oh] my gosh <malay>macam</malay> some people are just so lucky
<malay>lepas tu macam</malay> new joiner new secretary join [kan] <malay>lepas tu dia tak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> she she will be the mentor [lah] because she senior [what]
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
and then (uh) <malay>selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak</malay> [jer] [lah] like like just ask people to do [ah] ask people to do the powerpoint
(uh) ask people to change the <malay>apa</malay> send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay <malay>sekali</malay> it in the end <malay>bila dia punya</malay> boss <malay>tu dah tua</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali</malay> just before I left (uh) boss <malay>dia kena macam apa macam apa tu</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> retrench <malay>apa tu macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dah dah tua</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) <malay>kena</malay>
[ah] yes yes yes they say golden handshake [lah] but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
so (uh) they we speculated [ah] <malay>dia dia kata</malay> golden handshake so the boss leave right
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department [eh]
because obviously you are being paid too high [lah] and people have eyes to see [what] so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall [lah] like too bad
[kan] <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak</malay>
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every (uh) I think september october period she will go
for her europe trip [lah] this trip [lah] that trip [lah] I was like <malay>lepas tu</malay> the worst part is <malay>kerja lepak gila</malay>
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people <malay>yang macam</malay> very (uh) <malay>pandai buat</malay> powerpoint [kan]
[ah] then <malay>buat lepas tu dia dia</malay> just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
(uh)
[oh] my gosh ya [lah] she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive [lah] because she's such she's so rich [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>gila</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why I was like (uh) [oh] my gosh like so some people are so lucky
no [lah] but she was she was okay [lah] it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise <malay>macam suka</malay> ask people to do <malay>buat ni buat tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>lepas tu bila kita minta dia tolong</malay>
then she will be like (uh) sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment <malay>lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap</malay> okay <malay>dia tolong</malay> [kan]
<malay>sekali</malay> apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know <malay>macam</malay> bastard [kan] then then I will be like [oh] my god gosh like
[eh] when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you [seh] then I was like okay [lah] then just <malay>telan</malay> [jer] [lah] because we are all junior level [what] she's the senior [one] [what]
[oh] she's been there for a long very long [lah] usually those (uh) who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
(mm)
(mm)
really [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya that time my friend got told me the (uh) one of her experience [kan]
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority [lah] the the boss will give her the supplementary card [eh] but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever [lah] whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her (uh) [eh] later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like !wah! so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool [lah] like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
(uh) ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's (uh) he already ask me to pass you I was like
<malay>macam merepek</malay> [kan] like so funny
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) ya
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
!huh!
and then she never tell him <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] at least can just must tell him right
ya [lah] irritating because usually when they travel it's (uh) company [what] so but they can accumulate their own points
!haiya!
yes <malay>yang dulu tu</malay> (uh) every time want to travel on only
<malay>kecoh</malay> [seh] but actually because I want to collect the points [ah]
ya [lah]
so funny but they are allowed to travel on [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] cannot the expensive (uh) like whatever flight [eh] <malay>kau tahu dari</malay> like expensive flights and all that right
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>macam yang boleh</malay> cancel <malay>boleh</malay> change <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing [one] then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one [ah]
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right [ah] okay then we can get the cheapest [ah] like more less less risk
ya [lor]
ya [lah] <malay>tu pasal kadang-kadang</malay> [ah] like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change [lah] or confirm will change his flight [one] right
<malay>aku nak</malay> book <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> cannot so last minute [what]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
cannot [lah] cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because (uh) it's I think [oh] that one is because the name
the name is (uh) typo error or something typo
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the first name and last name <malay>terbalik apa</malay> and then got one or like I think two alphabet [lah] typo error
but it's so irritating [seh] because we went back and forth then I was telling them like (uh) when [oh] no the
<malay>salah salah salah</malay> the name (uh) of the passenger becomes my name
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that (uh) <malay>apa macam</malay>
back button [ah]
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one [ah] the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name [what] I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly [what]
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like [oh] shit
<malay>lagi pergi</malay> #hong kong# <malay>siak tu kalau pergi</malay> indonesia <malay>ke pergi mana mana</malay> like okay [lah] got potential to keep (uh) at most I pay back the company [what]
<malay>sekali tu</malay> that one is like like (uh) to #hong kong# and then is like completely different name [ah] so I called them up and asked to change right
and then (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation [lah] I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport the date of birth passport number <malay>semua</malay>
then <malay>cuma</malay> the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my (uh) I fill up my name
then (uh) there's one part that they they auto <malay>macam</malay> auto fill [eh]
auto fill so (uh) I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill [lah]
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
<malay>sekali</malay> I go and pay everything then I realise and then after [ah] but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation [lah]
anyway so I still have to pay [ah] I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited [ah] no show [ah]
<malay>tak baik</malay> [seh]
<malay>aku bilang aku punya tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> senior <malay>tu makcik tu makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh# <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (uh) it's okay [lah] everybody make mistake don't worry <malay>tapi dia baik cuma macam dia</malay> #kaypoh# [eh]
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku</malay> just tell the (uh) <malay>pula tu aku kena bilang</malay>
<malay>dia cakap</malay> just tell the he's a very nice person (uh) I will back you up anyway you just started
<malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] first time [kan] so <malay>aku cakap abeh tapi aku</malay> offer [lah] if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket [ah] <malay>muka sedih</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tu baik gila</malay> [sia] <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) nevermind it's okay (uh) just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
(mm) luckily like promotion and cheapest [eh]
ya [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> irritating <malay>tak boleh kasih</malay> chance [seh]
irritating <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi sekali</malay> (uh) is what [ah]

if we could eat one food for the rest of our life

<malay>apa sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>ketupat</malay> or with <malay>nasi</malay>
or <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>bergedil</malay> and <malay>nasi</malay>
ya
and sis <malay>tak akan</malay> get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent <malay>makanan yang</malay> I crave for is
<malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> [lah]
like ya because to me like <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is
life
<malay>sebab</malay> you will have everything there
you got <malay>paru</malay>
you got
<malay>ada</malay> veggie [ah] <malay>ada sambal kacang panjang</malay>
<malay>ada tahu tempeh</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> chicken
<malay>hati ayam pedal</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam ke pedal</malay> [eh]
<malay>limpa</malay> [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam</malay> [kan]

<malay>lagi-lagi ada udang</malay>
[ah] so <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is like everything that I like to eat is what <malay>macam satu</malay> dish you <malay>makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap</malay> [seh]
but it's considered one [what] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
(oo) <malay>tak</malay> consider [eh]
why why <malay>macam</malay> why like that
what <malay>tapi itu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi</malay> sis
<malay>pulut begitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>pulut tak ada rasa</malay> sis
one food [lah]
<malay>pulut</malay> [lah] but you cannot put other <malay>lauk</malay>
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
[ah] <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut</malay>
because <malay>pulut</malay> is one dish
see if talking about dish
then
the <malay>pulut</malay> is not a <malay>makanan</malay> it's not considered [lah]
but food is life
[kan]
because food is life <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>badan kita</malay> sis
(hmm)
(hmm)
seafood
(hmm)
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
!huh! what dang
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> sis <malay>nak makan apa</malay> make up your mind
(oo) if <malay>kita boleh</malay>
choose like <malay>macam</malay>
buffet is consider
like
buffet
consider
a dish <malay>tak</malay>
like if it's a type
buffet I can eat buffet for the rest of my life [ah]
like buffet !wow!
sis
!walao!
<malay>teh tarik</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> sugar cane
!wow!
!wow! sis
but top-up how many
but <malay>dia tak ada</malay> <malay>dia tak ada</malay> limited hours you <malay>boleh duduk dekat dalam</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if you go <malay>yang kita pergi dekat</malay> #yishun# <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but <malay>yang</malay> <malay>dia</malay> dinner <malay>dia</malay> up to four hours around three and a half hours [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
maybe because <malay>dia macam</malay> on the wheel <malay>sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ</malay> like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like <malay>kenapa</malay> Seoul Garden <malay>tak boleh</malay> extend <malay>dia punya duduk dekat dalam</malay>
but what are the chances that
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] but if like <malay>pun ramai orang masuk apa</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>kita duduk sebelum dua jam</malay> [seh]
or exactly two hours then <malay>kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu</malay> full
ya
so maybe next time we can try [lah] <malay>duduk dekat dalam</malay>
for like two hours plus and <malay>tengok kena halau ke tak</malay>
what
we should we should <malay>apa</malay> what's the word [ah] bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
experiment experiment that
but the the the the only downside of
<malay>yang</malay> is because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> they should <malay>buat air dalam</malay> jug <malay>taruk dekat situ</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> Seoul Garden so it's easy <malay>pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang</malay> the person <malay>hantar air</malay>
<malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>lepas tu nanti orang tu</malay> get irritated
<malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>pasal</malay> #naan# <malay>tu</malay>
the person <malay>yang</malay> get irritated

the
(err) <malay>macam</malay> to to the guy <malay>macam</malay> he is in between believing <malay>macam dia dia</malay> as
<malay>dia percaya</malay> in the unseen as part of faith
<malay>tapi</malay>
cannot mix with science [what] so he's trying to do both [tau] to be like <malay>nak</malay> try to make a logic of that
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay>
but <malay>ya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but <malay>benda</malay> unseen <malay>ni</malay>
we cannot <malay>macam</malay>
and it's not of our faith to like <malay>rukun iman</malay> we have to believe in the unseen <malay>sebab tu</malay>

cannot stack that is not <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> is not refundable

<malay>dah</malay> fuse black magic
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[kan] <malay>tiba</malay>
was it <malay>dia tengah</malay> driving <malay>ke apa</malay> no [eh] no no no no that was in aerostar bay [eh]
[ha] <malay>engkau tak kelakar</malay> [eh] brother
it's not funny [sia] you not funny <malay>lu lu cari pasal sama wa</malay> brother
inviting
okay I have this question [ah] like for example [kan] okay when
in islam we believe right <malay>kalau kita mati</malay> our <malay>roh</malay> does not exist co-exist in this <malay>alam</malay> already so that means we are in another dimension [tau] so our dimension only <malay>macam</malay> co-exist time we sleep <malay>betul tak</malay> so like for example if <malay>kita mati kita nampak orang-orang</malay> people then if
is it the <malay>roh</malay> of the people or is it ghost or like <malay>jin</malay> in a form of people
<malay>jin</malay> or <malay>syaitan</malay> [lah] but is it
a really <malay>roh atau jin</malay> in a form of
[ah] <malay>manusia</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
for them
but
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn <malay>rumah tu semua</malay> is actually not because of to have <malay>rumah</malay> for them and others right
it's actually to show that [ah] <malay>bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita</malay> or something like that
I heard from some people like that
is it
what if like life is like that [ah] then the <malay>miskin</malay> like got <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [seh]
you just imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kita macam</malay> the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe <malay>orang dekat sana</malay>
I don't know you steal
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you <malay>macam</malay> too depressed and you <malay>tak boleh</malay> happy tu cakap</malay> you it's like a lot story in the news that people <malay>bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri</malay> because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision <malay>atau</malay>
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin <malay>apa</malay>
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin [lah] so that's why I say <malay>macam</malay>
so even if <malay>kita kita tak ada duit pun</malay> it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do [lah] <malay>kita bunuh diri kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> people
okay imagine
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money [what] you you [ah] yo <malay>hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar</malay> gets into the head <malay>dia</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
socked in the head then <malay>terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa</malay> is it happens
but we don't know [what] like <malay>macam</malay> some people depression <malay>macam</malay> too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve <malay>dia punya</malay> debts then they kill
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing [what]
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya [lah] then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya [lah] then how to bribe
ya [lah]
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
(mm) islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
#allah# is #allah# won't judge you once
<malay>amalan</malay>
a chance to
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim [eh] let's say [lah] even if you have a chance <malay>syurga</malay> then if you still have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay> like you never know how long you have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay>
and one other story is like <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes it it gets to me <malay>yang macam</malay> [ah]
they say the first thing that will be questioned in <malay>alam kubur</malay> or in the hereafter is <malay>solat</malay> like if
if <malay>kau</malay> the first question like <malay>solat kau tak</malay> pass <malay>yang benda lain semua tak</malay> matter already
then it gets to me [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> then some people say like some <malay>mazhab</malay> say ya you no need to pay <malay>balik yang</malay>
the <malay>solat</malay> that you missed [ah] <malay>solat</malay> just <malay>solat taubat</malay> then you just try not to do it again
but some people some <malay>mazhab</malay> say you have to pay back after every <malay>solat</malay> like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until <malay>kita mampus</malay> then I asked I asked some people [lah] let's say [kan] <malay>macam</malay> how are we going to know how many <malay>solat</malay> that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay [lah] let's say <malay>kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis</malay> that at times <malay>kita solat juga</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
repay [oh] maybe if <malay>tak</malay>
I I wanted to I wanted to ask [lah] if let's say <malay>kita</malay> because we are busy in this world [kan] kita <malay>kejar kejar kejar kejar</malay> sometimes we don't have time to <malay>qada</malay> [kan] so let's say in a sense that <malay>kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh</malay>
like let's say like <malay>aku</malay> because of the missed prayer [kan]
then sis <malay>taubat</malay> so maybe <malay>macam</malay> sis <malay>susah nak tidur malam</malay> then the only time that I can wake up is <malay>pukul tiga pagi</malay> onwards [ah]
so maybe that's the time that like <malay>macam</malay> can be it <malay>macam</malay> not <malay>ganti</malay> [lah] like can it help or not
[kan] sis <malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] let's say <malay>macam</malay> I want to be prepared <malay>macam</malay> sis want best of both world I want <malay>macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat</malay> so let's say <malay>macam kita dekat dunia macam ini</malay> [jer] <malay>macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam</malay> we are already bad <malay>dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini</malay>
<malay>kasi air</malay>
[a'ah] [lah]
ya just like the story <malay>yang yang</malay> the <malay>orang yang bunuh yang</malay> the ninety nine killer or something like that or <malay>yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> repent
<malay>dia</malay> repent <malay>dia mati dia masuk syurga</malay> because the person say no he didn't <malay>belum</malay> he haven't [tau] <malay>taubat</malay> because #allah# take his <malay>niat</malay> as <malay>orang tu cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang</malay> first the first <malay>pergi dekat</malay> first <malay>ustaz ni</malay> he went there <malay>lepas tu ustaz tu</malay> say [oh] <malay>kau tak akan diampunkan</malay> [lah] <malay>kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua</malay> something like that [lah] so he out of <malay>geram</malay> he killed the <malay>ustaz</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> kill the <malay>ustaz</malay> you know
so he went to
[ah] then he went to this another <malay>ustaz</malay> then the <malay>ustaz</malay> was saying [oh] [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak berubah</malay> if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place <malay>macam tempat yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] so he [ah] <malay>kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama</malay> something like that
no this is another <malay>ustaz</malay> so he <malay>dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap</malay> so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place <malay>dia meninggal mati</malay> so <malay>bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga</malay>
ya because <malay>niat dia</malay> because <malay>dia belum taubat lagi</malay> [tau] he <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> because he just on his way to <malay>nak taubat</malay> to get out of the place then he already get to <malay>syurga</malay> so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the <malay>niat</malay> that matters [lah]
<malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi maki</malay> [jer] [lah]
so if you want to <malay>maki</malay> just <malay>maki</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
so I so I I thought I have this conversation [lah] so
moral of the story is all based on out <malay>niat</malay> [what] so if like #allah# decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of #jannah#
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya [lah]
plus point
<malay>tapi tak</malay> minus
<malay>dah ada</malay> stated there
<malay>dia tulis</malay>
so #allah# is fair like that #allah# love us in a way that way [lah] I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion [ah] a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society [ah]
<malay>islam</malay>
ya
I hope for that <malay>ustaz</malay> also yesterday that <malay>macam</malay> he's saying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we should educate our child
that
that be modest <malay>penting</malay> is part of islam and all but <malay>kita pun kena ajar anak kita</malay> that you know doesn't mean that <malay>dia tak pakai tudung</malay> she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child <malay>macam</malay> what islam is all about since young and it starts from <malay>asar dia cakap</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tak</malay> modest <malay>dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik</malay> it's not a good thing [ah] to me personally [lah] because <malay>pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan</malay> is all <malay>masing-masing</malay>
true
I think just now [ah] flying all my <malay>tudung</malay> then <malay>macam apa ni</malay> ten
#lam soon# singapore <malay>ke tadi</malay>
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [eh] what
ya [lah]
perfect
ya maybe we
<malay>kita dah pernah kena</malay> judge [lah] that's why we don't we know how it is <malay>kalau</malay> people judge us
like sis <malay>pernah kena</malay> judge <malay>masa</malay> sis <malay>kerja dekat</malay> [ah] my previous workplace <malay>yang kat</malay> #tai seng# <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] I I <malay>apa</malay> after I started <malay>pakai balik tudung</malay> right
slowly [lah] I think after that <malay>dah dua tahun</malay> [ah] but it's still slow still new [lah] then <malay>masa tu</malay> [ah] I was judged by one of the co-workers [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> then I asked why [lah] then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>baik</malay> but behind <malay>semua hisap rokok</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil laki orang</malay> [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> who are you to judge like <malay>macam</malay> just because <malay>satu orang buat kau nak</malay> judge <malay>aku macam itu</malay>
ya [lah] but it's not <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> [jer] <malay>buat apa yang tak pakai tudung</malay> also <malay>buat</malay> [what]
so why are you judging just because we wear <malay>tudung</malay> wear <malay>tudung</malay> doesn't mean <malay>yang kita ni malaikat</malay> [what]
and then sis <malay>macam tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> judge <malay>macam itu</malay>
you meet american union people start a
step <malay>baik</malay>
step good good
(hmm)
<malay>kurang ajar betul</malay>
what do you mean
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
ya [lah]
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are <malay>semua pun macam tak betul</malay> how
ya
at first sis was like sis <malay>dah jadi</malay> defensive [lah] because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends <malay>semua tak nak</malay> friend with me
because <malay>macam alim begitu</malay> [kan] she don't wan't to friend with me <malay>sebab</malay> she say [ah] <malay>kau dah pakai tudung</malay>
then <malay>buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat</malay>
then I say to her [lah] <malay>tak semestinya</malay> that I wear <malay>tudung aku baik</malay> [seh]
I wear <malay>tudung</malay> is because I wanted
to
change for <malay>agama</malay> [lah]
like sis want to change like <malay>sampai bila nak jadi macam itu</malay> maybe if I wear <malay>tudung</malay> it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to <malay>macam jaga diri</malay> in public
like sometimes <malay>kita dekat</malay> public <malay>kita</malay>
you know like <malay>macam dulu</malay> I never wear <malay>tudung</malay> then sis <malay>pakai baju</malay> low cut and <malay>nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk</malay> [tau]
our intention is not <malay>macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun</malay> but <malay>nampak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> to me it <malay>elak fitnah</malay>
[a'ah] especially especially if you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
when you wear <malay>niqab</malay> right <malay>dia punya niat</malay> is to stay away from guys right to <malay>macam</malay>
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern <malay>nya</malay> days if you wear <malay>niqab</malay> instead you attract more guys
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
you <malay>kau tak</malay> normal <malay>apa</malay> like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
(hmm) a lot of guys are <malay>macam itu sekarang</malay>
then because
<malay>masa yang si</malay> #nurul# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] then <malay>yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> [kan]
(err) ex #hafiz#
not the ex one [lah] the girl that she's getting to know [lah] <malay>yang dah kahwin</malay>
when she wear <malay>niqab dia nampak cantik</malay> [lah] like you will imagine her to be a <malay>cantik</malay> girl so many girls are adding her [tau]
and she received a lot of from guys [lah]
<malay>memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab</malay> she is very she is wearing <malay>niqab</malay> [what] so she delete all her pictures <malay>yang tak ada niqab</malay>
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
[ha]
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
no
no
for what
but sis don't want to be <malay>macam tu</malay> but sometimes
<malay>ada apa</malay> you know in malaysia <malay>ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> and then she's very young then <malay>macam nampak mata</malay> [jer] [kan] then she <malay>berbual</malay> very <malay>lembut</malay> very <malay>lemah lembut</malay>
[ah] then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>lemah lembut</malay> then <malay>muka kau cantik</malay>
then I when I was having this conversation with #hafiz# I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear <malay>niqab</malay> [lah] because the purpose of wearing <malay>niqab</malay> is to grown away <malay>daripada</malay> attention [what]
so if like <malay>aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku</malay> then <malay>lepas tu aku berbual</malay> <malay>begitu</malay>
because ya
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know <malay>kita dekat</malay> public [eh] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] like that
because sometimes when we wear <malay>tudung</malay> also our <malay>cara cakap</malay> also still the same [what]
so sis feel that
(hmm)
then
<malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>pakai pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>pakai niqab</malay>
you <malay>nak jaga macam mana nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes when we talk to guys like
<malay>tak tak</malay> open <malay>masuk kat masuk kat bawah</malay> [lah] <malay>tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah</malay>
I tried [what] once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say [lah] because when I see a people a girl wearing #niqab# (err) I have expectation on them [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I say <malay>macam</malay> I hear <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay> I hear <malay>dia orang macam</malay> giggle <malay>macam gedik</malay> like I don't like
[a'ah] [lah]
maybe because I have unresolved issue with <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay>
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue <malay>macam</malay>
like #neelofa# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa#
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
so <malay>macam</malay> so
people <malay>lagi macam</malay> have a better understanding of islam
so if <malay>kau</malay> react wrongly people <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>orang islam macam ini</malay> [lah]
no wonder [lah] you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief [lah] like I wanted to add [lah] that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear [ah]
then I've asked myself if I were to wear <malay>niqab</malay> then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like <malay>macam</malay> if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing #hijab# I am not wearing properly
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering [jer]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
big
big build ya
ya
then how [ah]
so sis <malay>jawab apa</malay>
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that (err)
people will judge us name like <malay>makcik-makcik</malay>
because we will be looking so dull
(mmhmm) maybe we should maybe we should start doing that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa# you know like
she change the misconception that <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>purdah mesti</malay> boring but if she change [ah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> sparkling <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> there's bling <malay>sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam</malay> okay [lah]
still
<malay>tak nampak macam makcik-makcik</malay>
what's the word [ah] the the the
ya #ringarde# I don't want to be #ringarde#
but
ya [lah]
true [lah]
and the creator
ya so like
so if you that's why they say when you <malay>pakai benda ni</malay> you are sacrificing the things that women like most
like being fashion
being looking like
<malay>cantik</malay> [lah]
ya
then remember <malay>mak</malay> saying you know like when you want to wear <malay>niqab</malay> when you want to wear <malay>purdah</malay>
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
because you are attracting people like if <malay>kau dah buat macam gitu</malay> that is
you just want to

how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no [lah] that [one] is different question
(mmhmm)
(uh) I think fit body [lah] better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina (uh) you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors [lah] okay I mean like everyday life also [lah] we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
[ah] <malay>kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan</malay> [lah] <malay>pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada</malay> fit body
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
of of course [lah] you have the looks you know <malay>tapi kalau</malay> your body doesn't fit
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important [lah]
yes correct correct
ya correct of course (um) of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks (uh) you know [ah] people say you have it's naturally
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like (uh) <malay>macam orang kata tu cerah</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> glowing [kan] [ah] glowing so I mean it is
it is naturally [lah] like that
so what will you think
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya so you see [eh] like nowadays generation you can see the different generation [eh] how they are very (um) they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about (uh) what to eat and what not to eat you see [ah] <malay>jadi dorang banyak macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak pergi mana tu</malay> (uh) <malay>makan</malay> fast food [kan] [ah] you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
but then they they they always [ah] you know
(uh) they always think <malay>yang</malay> the important is to to have a good looks you know <malay>buat</malay> expensive makeup you know and then wear [ah] good good clothes you know so that they will look good
that is only external but not internal you see [ah] this is what they they forgot [lah] so I think (um)
younger generation need to be educate <malay>mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kena banyak membaca</malay>
and then [ah] <malay>dorang kena tahu</malay> [lah] you know (uh)
<malay>macam mana nak apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam</malay> like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
(uh) do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no [lah] I think from from ya I mean <malay>daripada awal dah kena</malay> start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> choose <malay>makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua</malay>
(mm)
(mm)

(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) okay because I think about mental health [ah] it has to be
(uh)
it is not really easy to say [lah] okay it's not easy to say because we do not know [ah] what are the experiences that [ah] you know people (uh) I mean <malay>orang orang orang</malay> experience
[ah] <malay>pengalaman orang</malay> [kan] cause everybody has their own experiences <malay>ada</malay> background <malay>yang berbeza</malay>
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) this mental health <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) I mean okay [lah] <malay>memang makanan tu penting</malay> okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>selit</malay> lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar [ah] that is already <malay>dah</malay> important [lah] you know because even then
[ah] <malay>secara</malay> holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that (uh) but I I take vegetables I take also (uh) I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know [ah] depression ke <malay>apa</malay> so I I so I <malay>rasa</malay> that (um)
I <malay>rasa</malay> it is how you manage [lah] the situation
[ah] how [lah] you manage and you did also like <malay>macam</malay> talk to people (uh) with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters [eh] <malay>macam</malay> like when youngsters [eh] <malay>kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kena bercakap dengan orang</malay> [ah] <malay>bercakap dengan</malay> family <malay>tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang</malay> very <malay>menjayai</malay> you know
[ah] that any friends that you think that (uh) that support you and any friends that you that (uh) you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself [lah] whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
[ah] <malay>jadi sesama</malay> [lah] you <malay>tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah</malay> you [kan]

I think ya it's true it's true I think that (um) okay when you talking about the schools [eh] (um)
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being [ah] they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
so <malay>kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh</malay> accept (uh) the first degree of stress
<malay>yang ada</malay> [ah] second third degree <malay>pun masih boleh terima</malay>
[ah] ya depends on <malay>dorang punya</malay> capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> push [ah] cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind <malay>yang</malay>
can take the stress so you cannot push them further [lah]

(mm) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada</malay> stress <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] <malay>zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah</malay> [ah] you see I mean
children days are really a a days that memorable days [lah] I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like (uh) like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of (uh) like childhood memories [lah] childhood fond memories but like as for me
(mm) (uh) <malay>macam</malay> best [lah] <malay>kadang bila kenangkan</malay> (uh) <malay>waktu kecil-kecil dulu</malay> (uh) when my late dad was around [ah] how I spent my time with my dad and then (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>bila kita sama-sama</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> spend time <malay>balik kampung</malay> you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much [lah] about like
(uh) as a kid [ah] ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep [ah] that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
[ah] then you woke again then you you like play again you know [ah] you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems ya <malay>macam</malay> those memories are I think are the best [lah]
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody [lah] have their own good childhood memories
(uh) there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them [lah] but as for me my own experience (um) if I have a timer like what you say you know (uh) where where where do I want to go I <malay>nak pergi tu</malay> [lah] the my childhood life [lah] (mm)
so how about you
[oh] okay

within a floor think you can it you mention long term
(mmhmm)
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) what you say you want to go to the the ages [lah] okay okay
I think <malay>peringkat umur</malay> [lah] [eh] I think (uh) that that that is the reason [ah] why like <malay>macam</malay> you you are still young you know
<malay>jadi macam rasa nak apa tu orang kata tu</malay>
(um)
<malay>orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>kembangkan lagi pengetahuan</malay>
(uh) [kan] <malay>nak</malay> expand [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> your knowledge <malay>so jadi</malay>
you <malay>rasa sebab</malay> you <malay>perlu pergi</malay> to that ages you know to <malay>nak lebih mendalami lagi</malay> (uh) <malay>benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak pasti benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> (mm)
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) three wishes [eh]
(um) okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is (uh)
a healthy life [lah]
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>yang kedua ketiga apa</malay> [eh] okay [lah] <malay>yang pertama dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap</malay>
[oh] okay maybe (um) <malay>wang</malay> [lah] [ah] I think [oh] I <malay>nak jadi seorang</malay> millionaire [ah] <malay>bukan sahaja</malay> healthy <malay>tapi</malay> my wish
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa</malay> [ah] I mean not for myself but I think [ah] I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity [ah] I'm a very like <malay>macam</malay>
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children [eh] when they are in need children in hunger [ah] you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think (um) a bit sensitive to their situation
then <malay>bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang</malay> so I think <malay>tu yang yang</malay> can give me the most satisfaction [lah] <malay>itu</malay> second wish [lah] second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish (uh) <malay>seorang jutawan</malay> [ah] <malay>kaya raya</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni kurang kaya</malay>
okay then the third one the third one the third one (uh) the third one
what is it [ah] third one [ah]
[ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] you <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
(mm)
like for me right I think the other wish is that (mm)
since I have (uh) children so of course I I don't really ask [ah] more like of course [lah] as a a parent you want to see your children [ah] succeed in their life you want to see your children like <malay>macam</malay>
have and will be a successful because the of course that is (uh) <malay>memang tak terkecuali memang</malay> you <malay>nak tengok anak</malay> you <malay>berjaya</malay>
but (um)
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy [lah] healthy body and healthy mind
(uh) and then the the best part is (uh) good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good (uh) behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
(um) respect others
(uh) yes then (um) the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important [lah]
(uh) to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people <malay>macam sombong gitu macam apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>tak nak dengar kata orang lain</malay> you know <malay>macam terlalu</malay> ego <malay>ke</malay> so I
I I just hope [lah] that my children are not like that and then (uh) I just hope that whatever that my children do they must (uh) always think that life is really temporary
(uh) in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there (um)
(err) <malay>tidak ada perkara yang</malay> (uh) <malay>kekal dekat dunia ni</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) whatever that you have whatever that cherish it [lah] cherish it and also share share among other people
[ah] that is my my wishes [lah] I I think for my for my children
for my children
(mm)
<malay>hancur</malay>
people will like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> [ah] respect you [lah] respect you
yes correct no I mean (uh) of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
you know [ah] in this life right <malay>manusia manusia ni dorang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang akan tengok pandang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>berduit tapi</malay> you <malay>tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga</malay>
[ah] you see so the best thing is (uh) whatever it is ya <malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada duit pun tapi</malay> you <malay>sombong</malay> [kan]
[ah] so <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay> [lah] <malay>orang pun</malay> people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant [ah] you know you have a
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct

yes yes yes yes correct
<malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower [eh] <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower I <malay>nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit</malay>
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> flash [ah] speed [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam tu macam</malay> speed <malay>gitu macam</malay> whatever that I want (uh) I do [eh] I want to do in a very fast manner
[ah] you see
then I I I clean up the house right like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>habis</malay> one minute gone or two minutes !wah! all the house clean already <malay>semua dah bersih</malay> !wah! see I I I
(uh) I mean like then you can have <malay>apa orang kata tu</malay> relax <malay>lama-lama</malay>
[ah] <malay>rehat lama-lama</malay> [ah] but unfortunately I do not have that such power
(um) <malay>tapi kalau ada</malay>
ya no
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
ya
ya
there is (uh) good and bad [lah] we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first [eh]
see [ah] there there is a good and bad [lah] when talking about phones okay (uh) cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
[ah] you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you know <malay>senang semua</malay> but okay <malay>dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu</malay> flip flip flip the pages [ah] <malay>sekarang tak payah sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] you <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] youtube
[ah] you google [jer] okay <malay>nak cari resipi apa masak apa</malay> [ah] then you know from then on can you can already (uh) find the recipe that you want
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy [lah] and everything information at the fingertips but
main problem like <malay>contohnya</malay> I think for adults [eh] adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know [ah] they know when to use it you know (uh) they they know like <malay>macam</malay> when not to use it you know they they they have the <malay>orang kata tu tahu bila nak</malay> focus <malay>tapi kalau</malay> children <malay>memang</malay> talking <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age [eh]
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
you have TikTok and <malay>dorang dah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok</malay> TikTok <malay>sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat</malay> TikTok [kan]
[ah] <malay>kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay> then homework <malay>pun terbengkalai</malay> [kan] and then (uh) last time [eh] you see (uh) <malay>budak-budak dulu</malay> they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them [eh] cannot watch television [ah] you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them [ah] you see so
the I mean it's difficult [lah] to control it is more I think challenging
[ah] now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control [ah] you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy [lah] it's not really easy
(mm) it's not really easy
[ah] you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you <malay>suka tengok</malay> youtube you <malay>suka tengok</malay> netflix [ah] <malay>lagi sekarang</malay> netflix <malay>selalu dekat</malay> phone [ah] you see <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>nak nak nak</malay> stop <malay>ataupun kita nak ketepikan</malay> (mm) handphone <malay>tu</malay>
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
(um) <malay>pun ada</malay> good and bad <malay>dia</malay> [lah] maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of (uh) you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> were to take over humans [kan] then what humans going to do you know certain things <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] certain things I think (um) can you know take over humans <malay>tapi</malay> certain like <malay>macam</malay> profession <malay>tak boleh</malay> take over humans [ah] you know I think certain certain professions [lah] not all professions you know <malay>macam</malay> doctor you that's why <malay>boleh jadi</malay> doctor [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> <malay>jadi</malay> doctor
I <malay>rasa</malay> patient <malay>tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan</malay> [ah] you see <malay>ataupun</malay> nurses take over nurses I I don't think so [lah] that's why I tell you <malay>macam</malay> certain professions (uh) <malay>memang tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I mean take over
still need (uh) you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> take over <malay>abeh kita ni nak kerja apa</malay> [ah] you know how to earn money like that
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
[ah] so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
see so <malay>kalau macam</malay> humans [kan] <malay>lain</malay> humans [kan] [ah] humans <malay>ada</malay> limitation [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> sponge [kan] humans <malay>dia boleh</malay> adjust
[ah] you see so <malay>ye</malay> [lah] and and to add to that and to add to your <malay>ini</malay> [kan] questions you <malay>tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> maid <malay>pembantu rumah</malay>
[ah] you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right [ah] you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe [lah] can but then in terms of you talking about [eh] taking after the old people don't know (uh) how to how to really like <malay>macam</malay> like you say [lah] human touch they lack of that
(um) you see
ya I mean mean of of course
use use the app for for <malay>macam</malay> good purpose [lah] I think for cleaning up no problem because like like <malay>macam</malay> you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up (um) like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you do the job cleaners and all that (uh) simple simple job can take over [lah]
(uh) you know but other jobs that require (uh) you know you need deep thoughts <malay>ataupun kemahiran</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> doctor <malay>dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar</malay> [kan] so <malay>takkan</malay> you <malay>nak suruh</malay> take over [kan] (mm) you see
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang</malay> when you talk about technology in years to come [ah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> [kan] technology <malay>akan datang</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) we'll see [lah] that
<malay>mana yang lebih perlu</malay> [lah] at which at which sector
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah] then after that
ya
ya
!wah! I think [ah] I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem
rather than you know like <malay>sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah</malay> mental problem <malay>sekarang</malay> I think <malay>kalau ada kita nak adakan</malay> <malay>lagi</malay> (um) <malay>orang kata untu menggantikan</malay> (uh) all the professions (uh) <malay>orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah</malay> mental health problem
(mm) and and and one thing and one thing <malay>pun</malay> I think (um) if you <malay>nak</malay> have this right <malay>untuk menggantikan</malay> the soldiers <malay>pun</malay> not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war [ah] [kan] <malay>tak ada ramai</malay> [lah] human beings <malay>yang mati</malay> (mm)

okay
so these days
<malay>aku kat rumah</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> crochet [jer] [kan] <malay>tapi aku macam nak</malay> try
to design more
<malay>benda</malay> other than just <malay>macam</malay> bag <malay>pasal aku nak jual</malay> a few bags
<malay>tapi macam</malay> I want to try cardigan [lah] skirt
<malay>tapi aku takut</malay> because I need like <malay>macam</malay> time to try it out
<malay>macam</malay> model it out you know <malay>takut dia macam</malay> for sizes and all so
ya I think I want to I need your help
to <malay>macam</malay>
advise me on the sizing and then <malay>macam</malay> so what kind of design people is interested in
so ya
because my Instagram shop is not
progressing at all
I don't know
cause I don't have like <malay>banyak</malay> content <malay>cuma aku aku</malay> post <malay>apa yang aku ada dulu</malay>
<malay>tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya</malay> self <malay>bukannya orang beli</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku</malay> [jer] I don't know how to <malay>macam</malay> reach out to
because you know Instagram <malay>ada yang</malay> promote <malay>punya</malay> function <malay>tapi kena bayar</malay> <malay>aku tak ada duit dah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak</malay>
<malay>tak dapat tak payah cakap pasal kerja tapi aku tak ada kerja macam untuk tanggung aku punya</malay>
(uh) hobby <malay>punya</malay> expenses [kan] so ya
hobby is hard I want to try new things you also want to try new things right
but <malay>tak ada duit</malay> so what's the things <malay>yang kau nak</malay> try
[oh] I think
<malay>aku</malay> start <malay>pasal aku ada duit</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku</malay> the first step I did was <malay>aku beli mesin</malay>
that's that's the first step [lah] then even after that
that step I felt very <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli</malay> ruler
<malay>apa ni</malay>
all the materials [lah] because you know starting a new hobby is always so expensive but it's always been my interest and actually now is my passion [ah]
but I I still have not <malay>macam masuk class <malay>atau macam</malay> any course <malay>yang</malay> will teach me
professional way ya so I think <malay>itu pun aku nak kena belajar</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> if you want to join me
I think we can always join <malay>yang macam</malay> you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
<malay>yang</malay> I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like (uh) but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
<malay>aku nak</malay> join the highest level the <malay>terus buat baju kurung</malay> that [one] you know
ya but I think if we want to do we can find a time then we join this course together you know there's this thing that this (um) school
<malay>yang</malay> that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
yes
I think that [one] also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like <malay>macam</malay> after school (uh) part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents <malay>punya</malay>
you can just start [lah] you just go for it just invest a bit of money on like necessary items
ya
(mmhmm) yup
ya <malay>aku pun rasa sama</malay> I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many <malay>macam kedai dorang semua sama</malay> like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon [ah] they hyping all these <malay>kedai</malay> too much no offence
I saw one <malay>kedai dorang jual</malay> tote bag like
like basic <malay>gila</malay> tote bag <malay>dia abeh ada macam</malay> embroidery <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> pathetic [ah] to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like [oh] my god like I can do so much better
and some more <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada</malay> artistic <malay>punya</malay> course
that's why we always feel like [oh] no we can we can apply what we know and we can do so much ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's why that's why (um) <malay>apa ni</malay>
that's why because because <malay>dekat</malay> Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always <malay>kita selalu macam bilang</malay> you are artist you you gonna charge
<malay>punya harga mahal</malay> it's a piece of art it's a service people not <malay>tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu</malay> [pe]
so just charge <malay>lebih jangan jangan</malay> cause some more <malay>kalau kau</malay> charge low <malay>nanti</malay> other artist <malay>kena macam</malay> compare <malay>macam</malay> then the customer <malay>macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila</malay>
ya that [one] <malay>satu</malay> [lah] <malay>itu betul</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni benda-benda</malay> simple <malay>gitu</malay>
okay [lah] like I I guess <malay>rezeki dorang</malay> [lah] you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine <malay>atau</malay> machine just help you stitch <malay>atau</malay>
is it <malay>tulis</malay> letter <malay>punya atau</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) <malay>pasal</malay> my brother <malay>dia selalu buat</malay> commission work
so <malay>orang yang</malay> order <malay>dia punya</malay> commission work is like <malay>kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia</malay>
<malay>tapi dia pergi</malay> charge <malay>murah</malay> [seh] like A four
oil paint [eh] not oil acrylic <malay>punya</malay> paint they charge twenty <malay>dua puluh dua puluh dolar</malay> [jer] hello I'm
<malay>untuk dia senang</malay> [lah] <malay>memang untuk dia senang dia dia</malay> draw <malay>satu kali satu malam pun dah habis</malay>
so <malay>dia cakap tak akan aku nak</malay> charge <malay>mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap</malay>
<malay>benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang</malay> there's people out there <malay>yang</malay> charge <malay>benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku agaknya tak</malay> confident [lah] [eh] <malay>macam</malay> insecure <malay>macam aku nak jual</malay> tote bag <malay>aku</malay> <malay>berapa</malay>
<malay>macam mahal sangat kawan</malay> that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think <malay>kita</malay> people like us <malay>kalau nak</malay>
<malay>buat benda-benda gini</malay> we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in <malay>macam</malay> style no offence
no offence some people just no style
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals <malay>semua macam</malay> they all have the same style
and people dig for it so
[ah]
<malay>atau macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay>
scrunchie <malay>ada banyak kedai</malay> scrunchie
<malay>pasal</malay> scrunchie <malay>senang nak buat</malay>
just (uh) just <malay>kain</malay> straight <malay>abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi</malay> scrunchie ya
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak</malay> professional
looking [lah] ya
but I like how <malay>macam sekarang punya</malay> Instagram shop is like a <malay>baru punya</malay> like a new platform to <malay>jual</malay> and you don't have to take rent right <malay>itu satu</malay>
<malay>macam kedai</malay> physical <malay>kedai</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dorang pun aku</malay> follow a few <malay>kedai yang buat baju</malay>
and is (um) free like made to order
so <malay>kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak</malay> stock up
so <malay>kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu</malay> you can
(uh) measure yourself and then you have a like a tailor fit
<malay>baju</malay> ya I think that's very important
<malay>satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat</malay> [eh] I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
<malay>apa kejadah tu</malay> free size
how can anybody have the same <malay>baju badan</malay> like <malay>kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya</malay>
size <malay>jauh sangat tapi kau</malay> [kan] <malay>tinggi sikit</malay>
like I don't know my my legs bigger like you cannot just free size like you know T-shirt
M S S <malay>tu pun macam</malay> okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
<malay>tapi</malay>
ya what about all those people <malay>yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay> grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
(mmhmm)
which is like <malay>lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
which is sad why must we pay extra just for having our body you know like LOL
(mmhmm)
M [ah]
[oh] ya
it's like a range
(uh huh)
[ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mmhmm)
loose
<malay>lagipun sekarang macam kita</malay> our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation [kan]
<malay>kita</malay> more to <malay>macam</malay> a sustainable lifestyle
so <malay>banyak orang</malay> choose to <malay>beli</malay>
local <malay>atau</malay> secondhand <malay>atau</malay> thrift <malay>tapi</malay>
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand <malay>atau</malay> hand me down <malay>dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal apa ni</malay>
<malay>itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam</malay> smaller than people so <malay>kalau banyak orang yang macam</malay>
<malay>besar sikit</malay> then <malay>macam mana dorang nak</malay> like
sustainable <malay>dorang nak macam</malay> [oh] <malay>macam</malay> long don't buy from fast fashion <malay>tapi</malay> actually fast fashion <malay>pun baju semua kecil</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya that's why <malay>aku suka sangat dengan</malay> this new <malay>macam</malay> trend of <malay>kedai</malay> Instagram <malay>yang buat</malay>
custom fit is I think is very important I think <malay>kalau aku boleh jahit</malay> I think that's one of my goal <malay>macam</malay>
I like it's always at the back of my head to <malay>buka kedai baju</malay> [lah] actually <malay>tapi</malay> just I don't have the necessary
skill <malay>tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak</malay> [seh] <malay>aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai</malay> like yes
like yes the <malay>baju</malay> really is your <malay>baju</malay> it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your <malay>apa</malay>
your <malay>apa ni</malay>
wrist length ya
and like <malay>lagipun baju yang</malay> tailor is always last longer
<malay>aku ada banyak baju nenek aku daripada</malay>
<malay>tahun pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> tag <malay>ada nombor</malay> [tau] and <malay>nombor dia belum nombor</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay>
modern <malay>punya</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> nine <malay>tu</malay> ya number <malay>dia lima</malay> or something like that how old is that ya
yup
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
Loop Garms
[orh]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) chris #jericho#
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>pasal pasal</malay> (um)
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting [kan] thrift is <malay>macam</malay> cheap <malay>murah</malay>
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> sustainable is when you buy something that already exists <malay>tapi macam</malay> at the same time
[ah] so you don't have to <malay>buat benda baru</malay> so it's not wasteful [lah] <malay>kirakan tapi kalau</malay> vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is <malay>mahal</malay> hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people <malay>apa</malay> [seh] T-shirt one hundred dollar <malay>tapi macam</malay> is
it got it got <malay>apa ni</malay> is valuable is got context [ah] there there's a history to it
<malay>lagi</malay>
<malay>lagi apa ni</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>abeh yang</malay> thrifting <malay>ni</malay> secondhand <malay>murah macam kat</malay> lucky plaza <malay>pasal</malay> is
people <malay>tak nak</malay> I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people <malay>nak ke tak nak</malay> is demand versus supply [lah] that's what makes the price
so ya I think <malay>kalau orang</malay> confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price <malay>kalau</malay> two dollar that's not vintage <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>entah kenapa</malay>
(mm)
collection like people like collect things like (um)
[oh] ya <malay>lagipun</malay>
<malay>benda yang kita kena tanya ni</malay> actually <malay>kenapa baju sekarang murah</malay>
what makes it so like <malay>orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah</malay>
cause there's actually a cause behind that <malay>murah</malay> you know
<malay>pasal orang yang sepatutnya dia bayar tak dibayar</malay>
until very sad that's why <malay>aku macam sekarang aku dah</malay> hundred percent
(uh) prevent myself <malay>daripada beli baju dari</malay> Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually <malay>aku tak beli baju baru</malay> [lah] actually <malay>pasal</malay>
actually no offence <malay>tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju</malay> and <malay>baju kau semua lawa semua</malay> my size like I want to give people like I want to <malay>macam kasi kasi tapi</malay> !alamak! <malay>lawa pula pakai</malay> [lah]
<malay>abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar</malay> family <malay>aku dorang semua pakai baju kau</malay> [sia]
like the whole family went except for ya [oh] my god
you give me I I wish <malay>orang lain pun ada</malay> this kind of <malay>macam</malay> relationship with friends <malay>atau macam macam</malay>
<malay>nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang kampung boleh</malay> gather <malay>baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil</malay>
<malay>dia kasi aku</malay> so <malay>aku selalu ada</malay> these people around me <malay>yang akan kasi baju</malay> but then I I don't think other people
have that kind of privilege ya
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I <malay>ada orang tanya aku pasal</malay> this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get <malay>baju yang macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion <malay>tapi</malay> actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad <malay>tapi susah</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> ya I also don't have <malay>macam</malay>
much to say other than <malay>macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
yup
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>melayu</malay>
sorry sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
<malay>ye pasal</malay> [kan] actually <malay>kalau kau fikir fikir balik</malay> [kan] all this (um) wasteful <malay>punya</malay> life
<malay>cepat sangat</malay> is like so fast like it's sudden
<malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>kita</malay> <malay>yang boleh nampak</malay> [lah] the drastic changes actually <malay>dulu-dulu</malay>
how to say [ah]
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish <malay>lelaki dia nak</malay> create plastic bag <malay>pastu dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> he wants it to be a more sustainable (uh) alternative [tau]
<malay>dia tak nak pakai</malay> tree <malay>dia tak nak pakai</malay> paper bag <malay>pasal</malay> is from trees
<malay>abeh dia tak nak pakai macam</malay> cloth bag because it's (uh) to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang</malay>
<malay>kita salah guna</malay> [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> convenience <malay>kita buang</malay> after every use which is
that that whole term of disposable is very
crazy to me disposable how can <malay>satu benda kau buat susah-susah</malay>
<malay>terus kau buang</malay> plastic bag <malay>macam</malay> factory <malay>kena</malay>
<malay>lagi kalau kau belajar</malay> chemistry you know how all this thing is created <malay>daripada</malay> element <malay>dorang semua</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> if you really look from the root [kan] <malay>kau macam</malay> [oh] my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
[eh]
(uh huh)
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
effort is put to
so going back to <malay>yang cakap pasal kedai</malay> Instagram and <malay>orang sekarang banyak buat benda</malay>
the (uh) it's a like <malay>bagus yang orang sekarang</malay> (uh) try their best <malay>untuk belajar</malay> all these skills <malay>balik buat apa ni</malay>
just <malay>buat benda-benda</malay> simple [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>dorang ada apa</malay>
<malay>ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini</malay> once you <malay>buat</malay> you <malay>akan</malay>
<malay>hargai</malay> you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
that's why you you know like you shouldn't take all these thing for granted you know
once you because we are so <malay>jauh daripada</malay> the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> [eh] [a'ah] [eh] <malay>macam mana macam sayur sayur</malay> <malay>orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang</malay>
ya so
it's actually not our fault [lah] it's just how time has changed <malay>abeh macam tapi</malay> #alhamdulilah# <malay>kita dapat</malay> this
<malay>ilham</malay> this know in our head that we get to <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [lah] just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
so that future generation
we we can <malay>lagipun kita bukannya</malay> sustainably more aware [jer] I think we just more aware of everything
include the discrimination
which is sad

<malay>pasal aku suka tengok cerita</malay> korea korea is like more in depth like they have a lot of issues
ya and and they have a lot of shows because they are very funded their arts is very funded I mean look at K pop
something that singapore cannot achieve

[eh] D <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay> (uh) <malay>awak sekarang tengah buat apa ni</malay>
<malay>tak ada kerja</malay>
!alamak! (uh) lynn <malay>sekarang tengah kerja kat</malay> catering kitchen [ah] <malay>buat kerja</malay> part time <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak kerja</malay> (uh) I <malay>boleh ajak</malay> you <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>awak nak tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya ya ya I remember her
(mmhmm)
!alamak! <malay>kesian</malay>
[oh] really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
(mm) I'm not so sure I think you can do some (uh) admin job duties I know in my workplace (uh) sometimes we have (um) we need we get orders from customers for #bentos# or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to (uh) hire someone for the time being especially during this period [lah]
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
(mm) I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay #hijabis# not (uh) not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this (um) poll [lah] (uh) asking whether like have any of us malay #hijabis# ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset [lah] like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
[oh]
(mm)
!wah!
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry (uh) for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab (err) restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried [oh] let's say what if the medicine or anything like
<malay>kena</malay> the hijab then later got stains all those germs [mah] so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always (uh) how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
and I think in social media it has been blowing up [ah] but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay [lah] [ha]
!aww!
it's not fated man

!huh!
then how do you exist
ya [lor] might as well just don't pray [lor] you leave the religion I mean it's a bit extreme [lah] but
I don't know how to say this it's a bit of a sensitive issue
(mm)

golden child

standing near this guy from school of engineering so (uh) I was like his shirt quite cute [eh] he wear spider-man shirt then I was like [oh] I like your shirt it looks cute then he was like [oh] thank you then after that (um) suddenly (uh)
we were doing some other things [ah] so after the block visit right we were sitting down then after that he was like playing with the cat obviously I went to him but not because of him [lah] I went to the cat cause I like cats [mah] so I was like playing with the cat I was then suddenly we were like talking and talking cause like we both like cats so we like started talking [lah]
and then he said (uh) can we exchange numbers cause you know for the (uh) final year project I was like okay [lah] I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay [lah] why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right (uh) what is that movie [ah] marvel is it not star wars <malay>apa</malay> movie <malay>tu yang</malay> viral
the I love you three thousand a lot a lot of people say [ah] end game whatever the heck that movie is [lah]

the way I kind of broke contact with him was a bit harsh [lah] because I remember at that time we had another block visit then after that he was like messaging me late at night I think it was around eleven plus so I told him [oh] (err) I want to go and pray first [lah] then he was like okay after you pray text me [ah] then after that I ignore him already

<malay>lepas tu balik daripada tu</malay> (um) like <malay>kakak pengsan gila macam</malay> even <malay>bila dah habis makan</malay> right
when we were sitting there I am so exhausted like halfway through when <malay>dekat yang dekat faiz tu</malay> at the #caldecott# there's like a small
long hill that we have to climb [oh] my god
I was so exhausted I can't cycle
<malay>tak boleh</malay> cycle I can't like <malay>kakak macam terhuyung-hayang</malay> and I so <malay>panas</malay> so I took the <malay>air botol</malay> and then I pour my

but you know like the only body part of your body that you can shape is your nose

so you should press it because last time you always listen to <malay>kakak aimah kakak aimah</malay> don't like
[ah] <malay>hidung mancung</malay> cause he say cause he say <malay>hidung tinggi nanti sombong</malay> like literally <malay>peribahasa hidung tinggi</malay> then I was like what the hell

ya ya ya you can shape it it's just everyday you just you like this
<malay>abang long</malay> shape his nose
that's why he got such a nice nose if you look at his nose
it's like those like <malay>macam</malay> perfect <malay>macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa</malay> for an
[ah] for an asian guy so and then because I also <malay>ibu</malay> also always like you know <malay>ibu hidung mancung</malay> [ah] cause <malay>atuk</malay> is like indian or whatsoever
you know indian or K K K no idea
[ah] ya whatever so <malay>ibu</malay> got that <malay>hidung mancung</malay> [mah]
then <malay>ibu</malay> always say <malay>hidung hidung penyek</malay> cause follow <malay>ayah</malay> [mah] so serious I always like <malay>picit</malay> my <malay>hidung</malay> cause I want
like the
(um) <malay>hidung mancung</malay> then after that I always thought my <malay>hidung</malay> was big
<malay>macam</malay> I don't know like <malay>macam</malay> because like <malay>orang</malay> keep on saying <malay>macam ibu</malay> keep on saying <malay>hidung besar hidung besar</malay> so
so ya [lah] you <malay>tahu</malay> when <malay>hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila</malay>

[ah] #amirah# #amsyar# #ami# they are they are good looking [ah]
<malay>dekat nur</malay> and [eh] [ah] #nur# and

so then after that I <malay>tak nanti</malay> I think I met <malay>abang lukman abang lukman</malay> say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite <malay>mancung</malay> for a malay [lah] then I was like [oh] I didn't know that
[ah]
ya then I just realise that my nose is actually small
ya but it's still considered small <malay>tengok macam tak
<malay>apa</malay> mermaid man
ya
but then it's like <malay>kecil</malay> then [oh] it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
[oh] it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I <malay>gemuk</malay>
exactly because <malay>ayah ayah</malay> keep on saying (uh)
(uh) <malay>gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak</malay> so it's like <malay>macam daripada kecil</malay> you have that body <malay>yang gemuk</malay> but then <malay>padahal</malay> you <malay>tak cukup makan</malay>
do you understand that ya
ya scrawny almost anorexic
[ah] [ah]
ya it's not the normal <malay>beras apa</malay>
and then <malay>aku tak tahu sekarang tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam</malay> I can do it
ya but I was before I married I was at the optimal weight already which is like forty six
then <malay>bila</malay> I stayed at his parents I <malay>timbang</malay> I was forty nine

<malay>mesti pun hantu ayam</malay> because <malay>kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit</malay> so <malay>macam bazir</malay> so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
freaking chicken
but that's because rice [lah]
no chicken is protein [what]
you sure
<malay>sahaja</malay> luckily your face don't turn into chicken
like a
(um) <malay>habis</malay> but then you skin will be saggy
<malay>mengadu saja engkau</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kentang</malay> chicken
<malay>kau tak tahu masak apa hari ini</malay>
ya !aiya! <malay>kau ni mahal mahal juga</malay> !aiya! <malay>tak tahu nenek cakap satu</malay> meal <malay>berapa</malay> [tau] <malay>beberapa keping ayam</malay>

<malay>dia</malay> <malay>lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak</malay> pieces <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh dapat</malay> thirty six
[ah] separated <malay>kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks <malay>dengan</malay> wing <malay>atau lapan belas</malay> set of drumstick that is how much [tau]

I thing is [ah] I think [ah] <malay>ayah dan ibu</malay> even the chicken I mean [ah] sorry it's not that nice
<malay>macam</malay> what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like <malay>masak</malay> but she don't like to taste her food
she's a bad taster
[ah] is <malay>abang</malay> home already
because of the medicine [ah]
ya
but actually [kan] it's better to put him at the living room
<malay>sebab</malay> because living room <malay>itu baru</malay> if you make <malay>dekat tu</malay> also so it's nicer for him whereas the <malay>bilik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam dah tunggang pecah</malay> if you understand
in the point of <malay>macam</malay> healing [kan] it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than <malay>macam</malay> old you understand
ya
<malay>kena buat</malay> partition [lah] <malay>ayah kena panggil buat</malay> partition
<malay>buat</malay> [lah] partition
[ah]
<malay>tu bila tu boleh datang pecahkan</malay>
that house that house is so big it has so many potential <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>sedih esok nak pergi apa</malay>
[ah] recognise or <malay>macam ayah</malay> [eh] <malay>ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk</malay> renovate and then <malay>ibu pula malas nak</malay> maintain so <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god
[ah] ya ya ya
<malay>macam</malay> they they put the effort to
cause <malay>ayah</malay> will start something and then he he will expect <malay>ibu</malay> to follow up with it
ya that they both
what the heck bro
<malay>macam dah lapuk</malay> is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
maybe too outdated man
why so <malay>degil</malay> [one] [ah]
ya can you imagine <malay>kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu</malay> nah
<malay>kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam</malay> japanese style
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>macam lawa macam</malay> just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice [eh] <malay>macam</malay> those
zen
[oh] is it but you <malay>baring</malay> if you put your
<malay>tilam</malay> only if you put your <malay>tilam</malay> [ah]
cause like that time I went to japan the second time
you know I go before right
[oh] you know I told you then the bedroom is [ah]
the <malay>bawah</malay> is literally (err)
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay> like (err) literally like that <malay>tapi tak rasa</malay>
you don't feel it [ah] the only thing bad about that thing right they literally <malay>macam</malay> blew the <malay>papan</malay> onto the floor
so <malay>kalau macam</malay> in the future <malay>kalau nak macam</malay> shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially <malay>macam dia orang</malay>
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>macam kecil macam dia orang punya</malay> design of <malay>barang macam macam kecil</malay> and it's so efficient in my opinion
so <malay>kakak cakap suka gila</malay> that time when we went to
#kyoto# [ah] then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture <malay>kedai perabot</malay>
I think they literally <malay>jual macam</malay> one set <malay>macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya</malay>
cabinet <malay>atas dengan</malay> cabinet <malay>bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> there is literally one unit
then when people moving [ah] they just buy that thing
and it's
and <malay>boleh masuk</malay> bathtub
[oh] my god like I think that one of the hotels we went the time is smaller than us and it can fit a fucking bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet [ah] <malay>macam bodoh</malay> [sia]
why can't they put the <malay>jamban</malay> and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
wooden door
[ah]
ya the the worst part you can't change the arrangement
that's the worst part
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>jamban</malay> just put together right [oh] my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so <malay>bodoh</malay> like even the <malay>tingkap</malay> this one [ah]
<malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau rumah lama</malay> is <malay>dekat atas</malay> [pe]
this like for example <malay>kalau macam hujan</malay> but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows [mah] then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below <malay>air hujan masuk</malay> it's like so <malay>bodoh</malay> I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
<malay>tapi ini macam bodoh</malay> <malay>macam bodoh gila</malay>
that is very even like wiring is inside [mah]
<malay>rumah</malay> #juan# <malay>yang dekat</malay> (uh) (uh huh)
[ah]
<malay>macam lawa macam</malay> it looks like a bedroom <malay>macam ni</malay> it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the <malay>jemuran</malay> [eh]
this one is not custom made it's ikea [lah] but it's still okay looks it looks fine [lah] (mm) looks decent [pe]
ya
and it's so cluttered I don't know it
they don't even know what is inside the <malay>kotak</malay> right
[ah] [ah] ya
[ah] ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture <malay>macam tu</malay> if ikea stuff don't buy on the <malay>kedai</malay> itself <malay>pergi</malay> carousell
[ah] [ah] [ah]
<malay>jual</malay> and then <malay>jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa</malay> [seh] dining table <malay>dua puluh aku beli dua ratus</malay>
so <malay>macam geram gila macam ini</malay> set alarm right (um) we bought this two hundred and forty
I think got some more online sell for a sixty dollar fifty dollar in good condition cause just imagine
<malay>kita nak kita nak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam banyak</malay>
ya
ya
ya <malay>kau macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sakitnya hati</malay> ya #allah# ya
so <malay>macam tak perlu</malay> [seh] I mean like the thing <malay>macam almari ni</malay> seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
carousell for at like two hundred dollars
brand new <malay>lagi</malay> just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
a new wardrobe
<malay>itunya macam menyesal</malay> so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] just buy from carousell
I mean <malay>yang paling biasa</malay> I carousell <malay>kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan</malay> free items [eh]

okay fine
<malay>atau</malay> swing <malay>taruk dekat</malay> living room [ah] living room <malay>lagi nampak</malay>
(hmm)
okay so you want to put on the wall
the <malay>yang</malay>
okay okay
[eh] but but
but they provide the
mount <malay>nak kena</malay> pay extra [eh]
mount <malay>cuba kalau</malay> because if we mount <malay>kita tak boleh alih-alih</malay> [kan]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
why do I want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
if let's say ya <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam kat rumah awak</malay>
[kan] <malay>macam mak</malay>
from this side then <malay>dia nak</malay> change to the other side
[ah] <malay>lepastu ni sekarang dia nak</malay> change to this side <malay>balik</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam dia boleh</malay> change <malay>tapi kalau</malay> [dah] mount
[dah] <malay>tak boleh tukar</malay> [dah] <malay>tak boleh ubah</malay>
the mount is inside the wall
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down <malay>mana nak taruk</malay> <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>boleh memang betul</malay> but then
if we want to mount
<malay>dekat</malay> wall the other side is not
is not a wall it's a
wooden wall <malay>faham tak</malay>
it's not a actual wall it's a wooden wall
(mm)
but if you put it on a console
<malay>dia boleh alih</malay> even with the console <malay>dia boleh alih</malay>
[ah]
like that
<malay>sama juga</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>kalau kita ada</malay> console
we can move it to the window <malay>macam</malay> my house
ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> my house <malay>dia tak</malay> mount [kan] then on on top the console [pe]
[ah] so <malay>dia boleh alih-alih</malay>
so from there <malay>dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat</malay> wall <malay>atau dia boleh dekat</malay> this wall
[ah]
that's what I mean so
so you can you can actually <malay>macam</malay> if let's say this year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay> then next year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay>
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood you know <malay>tukar tukar tempat ke</malay>
it it might you know we don't know which which [one] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena dengan kita</malay> [pe]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) correct correct
no lights can just <malay>tampal belakang</malay> [jer]
<malay>tampal belakang</malay>
so the light shine <malay>dekat tembok</malay>
it moves with the it moves with the console [mah]
so it it if <malay>kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> shine
<malay>dia boleh</malay> shine <malay>boleh boleh</malay> shine <malay>tapi tak nampak sangat</malay> [ah]
not that not that really nice [lah]
but if you put on the wall <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] facing the wall
then the the light will show <malay>apa</malay>
will <malay>memacarkan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dia punya dia punya cahaya dia memacar</malay>
<malay>cahaya dia boleh memacar</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> wall
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya true
<malay>memang nanti nanti pun pasal belum</malay>
<malay>belum apa belum tahu nak pasang ke tak</malay>
but it will be cool [lah]
<malay>kalau pasang</malay>
(mm)
of course [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
of course not [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [dah] colour colour

<malay>putih</malay> [eh]
then <malay>sini macam</malay> grey
and then <malay>sini putih sini</malay> grey
so that it will look <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] how to say [eh]

[ah] okay
never mind
we see how we see how
okay then so you mean that you want the same colour but in a different
tone of the colour

okay okay

I understand I understand
all the sentimental values and all that I understand it's just that
why frame it

if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
somewhere around here <malay>pun</malay>
you won't look at it everyday [what]
it's there but you won't look at it everyday
then then like that
no need to have frame [lah]
waste of space might as well you just <malay>tampal tampal tampal</malay> everything on your
feature wall
we are teenagers

okay
<malay>apa boleh buat tahi bulat bulat</malay>
<malay>masuk dalam botol hisap batang kuat</malay>

[eh] then you have your
whole wall then I have
!wow!
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
<malay>apa dia yang kita nak kena dalam masa terdekat</malay>
of course
[ah] I need to check again because the last [one] I check is [ah] about
two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus [ah] something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
<malay>murah punya</malay> [ah]
why cannot
<malay>tapi dia ada</malay>
if I'm not wrong there's a
(uh)
price for it
if five room <malay>berapa</malay> how much <malay>harga dia</malay>
if four room <malay>berapa harga dia</malay>
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
<malay>tapi dia cakap</malay> five room
<malay>dia tak cakap berapa besar</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
then say [lah] you put your price like that [what]
not my <malay>pasal</malay> [what]
correct what not my <malay>pasal</malay> [what]
you advertise five room [mah]
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot [what]
<malay>tak tahu pula</malay> [eh]
one one five
(mm)
!aiya! #cincai# [lah] #cincai# [lah]
if malaysia <malay>boleh</malay>
we also <malay>boleh</malay> [mah]
(mm) <malay>tak ada apa</malay>
nothing
no I was thinking
I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
(mmhmm)
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
check [lah] we check like <malay>macam bawah</malay> bowl <malay>ke</malay> bowl seat bowl <malay>tu ke apa ke</malay>
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think the sanitisation <malay>tak</malay> include cleaning <malay>ke</malay>
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the [one] that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
(mm)
!wow! you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself [lah]
they will have a special
[ah] <malay>apa nama dia</malay> they will have a
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
jet no they don't need the jet spray you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> scrub <malay>apa lantai</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> they have that they have that <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
that chemical

so ya
I <malay>nak minum</malay> hot chocolate <malay>dulu</malay>
!wow!
<malay>nak cakap apa</malay>
[oh] interesting
okay so <malay>kita memang dah tak</malay>
<malay>makan</malay>
meat products as much as we did before I mean <malay>dua ribu dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh dah</malay> kind of okay
so how how far <malay>lang nak</malay> go in to into veganism
I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
<malay>tapi</malay> in a way I think we're almost
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
I <malay>rasa</malay>
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>macam ada</malay>
selfishness <malay>sebab</malay> I don't
feel the same thing <malay>bila macam guna ikan bilis</malay> just because they are smaller than a chicken or <malay>lembu</malay>
[ah] I <malay>rasa</malay> selfish <malay>sebab</malay> they should be equal
okay
ya ya ya <malay>faham</malay> #mukbang#
(mm)
[a'ah] in a way [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean <malay>orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing</malay> is our companion pet <malay>banyak orang guna sebagai</malay> [ah] <malay>ada anjing</malay> as pet
but when it comes to chicken or duck
<malay>kita pun pernah bela itik</malay>
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
<malay>manja</malay> [lah] <malay>binatang tu</malay> can be so is that the same comparison
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi kita</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> (err) hunting and gathering food from [ah] natural resource <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
<malay>kalau orang dulu-dulu dia tak berkebun pun</malay>
<malay>berkebun tu selepas</malay>
<malay>dia pergi memburu semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>baru</malay> come this <malay>era bila orang</malay> start <malay>berkebun</malay> and <malay>jumpa teknik berkebun</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>tak ingat</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> go into veganism you <malay>akan</malay>
be a vegan [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> vegetarian
<malay>telur</malay> I cannot leave that I mean I
I <malay>boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu</malay> but I feel like I need my protein <malay>daripada telur</malay>
(um)
[ah] mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
<malay>tapi</malay> the challenge
is
<malay>macam kita dekat sini</malay>
[ah] you I <malay>tak</malay> sure <malay>tapi</malay> I
if I were to be a vegan
the challenge will come <malay>bila balik rumah mama</malay>
and mama
<malay>masak apa yang dia masak</malay> [lah] I don't think I have the strength to <malay>tolak</malay>
because it's not something <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> every day
I I can do that <malay>kalau pergi kedai kawan</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau balik rumah</malay> family <malay>dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan</malay>
but I myself don't have the strength to <malay>tolak apa yang dah ada tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] and <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masak sedap gila</malay>
so <malay>susah</malay> [ah]
you <malay>macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>apa yang</malay> spark your idea <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
vegan
is is there a certain
(err) timeline <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>yang membuat</malay> you <malay>sampai ke</malay> part <malay>yang mana</malay> you <malay>nak jadi</malay> vegan <malay>ni ada cerita dia ke</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> cringe cringey
(mm)
I <malay>rasa</malay>
I
don't have anything
<malay>yang betul-betul macam</malay> the moment <malay>yang</malay> spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
because of all the free time
(um)
and because of a lot of things [eh] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>bagi</malay> [tau] I [lah] and <malay>dia macam</malay> I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
but actually (um)
in southeast asia
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> we have abundant soy sauce we have that (err) we have abundant soy derived products <malay>macam tempeh tauhu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>sedap</malay> [jer]
[oh] my god
ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay> crave
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
born born to be slaughtered [lah] basically
(mm)
spread <malay>penyakit ke macam nyamuk</malay> you you never know which one <malay>yang gigit</malay> you <malay>yang bawa</malay> aedes
extreme [lah] I mean I I think <malay>dua hari lepas</malay> #kot# I <malay>kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>selain</malay> delving into veganism <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>ada</malay> #kot#
and then
[oh] okay
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>punya azam tahun ni</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
start drawing again
<malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>dah lama sangat tinggalkan</malay> drawing and <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>rasa janggal nak buat</malay> the kind of drawing <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>pernah buat dulu</malay>
<malay>janggal gila sampai sampai macam</malay> halfway <malay>tu dah menyampah</malay> [tau]
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> I I [tau] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau</malay> practise every day
<malay>dia makin lama makin</malay> okay so that's one of my
(err) two thousand twenty one resolution
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
(err) come back to
<malay>belajar</malay> italian
and probably greek as well <malay>sebab tu pun dah tinggal</malay> quite <malay>lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu</malay>
(um) <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
I
I wish I can say <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> seriously
<malay>belajar</malay> music but
but
but quit <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't have the same passion <malay>untuk tahu</malay> what's behind the system
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> not not as fulfilling but
by by time
(mm)
<malay>atau</malay> maybe about
(um)
<malay>nak cakap</malay> lack of audience <malay>pun tak juga</malay> [ah]
even <malay>dekat rumah pun</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> not as motivated [lah] <malay>untuk untuk pegang</malay> musical instruments
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
just in case <malay>tapi kalau dah beli</malay> then <malay>tak main</malay>
<malay>bodoh juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] my other resolution
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] before this <malay>kita</malay> depend on performance and
[ah] fully on music then
if we have side jobs <malay>yang</malay>
work from home
then <malay>tu macam</malay> bonus but by by the end of last year <malay>dia dah</malay> turn to the other way round
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang</malay> more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way [lah] because I <malay>tak selesa pun untuk keluar</malay> and perform and <malay>jumpa orang</malay> in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still <malay>nak ada</malay> event <malay>takut juga</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> new year resolution <malay>apa yang dah boleh tiru dah</malay> I <malay>punya</malay>
(um)
greek
I I
<malay>berasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak belajar</malay> japanese <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> food wars <malay>tu tapi</malay>
better <malay>untuk</malay> focus <malay>dekat</malay>
one or two language first [lah] before ventured out
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god ya
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so far italian is not that hard I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> catch up <malay>balik</malay>
(mm)
[ah] and I <malay>suka sebab macam</malay> once you <malay>belajar</malay> italian you can kind of <malay>faham</malay> french as well <malay>dia ada kaitan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia ada kaitan</malay>
quite beneficial <malay>untuk</malay> learn that one language
<malay>sebab dia boleh</malay> branch out to <malay>bahasa-bahasa lain selain</malay> language to <malay>apa lagi</malay> you <malay>punya ni</malay> you <malay>punya azam</malay>
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia macam</malay>
(uh) I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore <malay>cakap</malay> the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself <malay>dia dah ada</malay> everything <malay>yang dia nak</malay>
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
I <malay>rasa</malay> it's not
a total shit show [lah]
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
and then ending <malay>pun</malay>
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya [lah] cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
(mm)
[oh] but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait [lah]
(um)
what else [ah]
you you you you decide the topic <malay>pula</malay>
if you go
the the
<malay>apa yang akan jadi</malay> in two thousand twenty one [ah]
[ah] two thousand twenty one
I <malay>rasa akan ada</malay>
a burst of
creative contents
for sure <malay>sebab</malay> in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> musicians <malay>tak dapat buat</malay> shows
[ah] ya artist <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start <malay>macam</malay>
this this cannot
(um) go on for too long I have I have to do something to
to make everything better for myself [lah] <malay>sebenarnya</malay> especially if that's their only creative outlet
<malay>dia</malay> redundant it's very redundant
(mm)
but what about live shows I think (um) live shows <malay>pun dah</malay> start <malay>ada</malay> search <malay>juga</malay> because (um) <malay>sebanyak yang</malay> start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay>
social distancing code scanning and everything so <malay>itu pun</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
(mm)
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
(mm) (mm)
natural selections
(mm) (mm)
I <malay>baca dekat</malay> twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
<malay>macam</malay> flu or fever side effect <malay>yang teruk-teruk</malay>
so I think I <malay>pun tak walaupun</malay> I <malay>takut jarum</malay> but I don't think I <malay>akan</malay> stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
(mm)
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay>
I mean even <malay>sekarang masa</malay> pandemic <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>dah tak ingat</malay> what happened in june in may
duolingo
(mm)
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic <malay>ni akan berlangsung lama</malay> and they cannot depend on skill <malay>yang dia orang dah ada</malay> so they have to broaden their horizon
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
okay can you explain <malay>pasal</malay> stoicism <malay>sebab</malay> I try <malay>baca tapi</malay> I <malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> philosophy philosophical standpoint
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
<malay>semua ni sebab</malay>
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you <malay>memang dah</malay>
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
<malay>benda ni macam</malay>
very personal because
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding <malay>tak sama</malay> so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
I don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
once the border <malay>buka</malay>
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
I want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
scandinavian countries <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama</malay> european
<malay>bukan yang yang yang tak payah</malay> stamp passport <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam</malay> schengen countries [eh] [oh] <malay>termasuk</malay> [oh] then why
[oh] ya ya
sweden
[oh] yes denmark
K [lah] hopefully next time
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>memang</malay> curious on how they can manage to provide
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
what about southeast asia or asia [lah] in general <malay>ada tak yang</malay> you <malay>nak pergi</malay>
<malay>ke kita memang</malay> western centric
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)
(mm)
I think <malay>sebab</malay> I think the the the reason is because
(um) <malay>dia orang</malay> preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit <malay>macam dekat sini</malay> most of them are
in ruins
(mm)
[ah] you you cannot see with your own eyes
<malay>tapi</malay> asia I
<malay>nak pergi tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> indonesia but but but the parts <malay>yang kita tak pergi</malay> before [ah]
I think <malay>tu pun</malay> interesting and for some reason
I <malay>nak pergi</malay> thailand <malay>sangat sangat sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak dia punya</malay> street food
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] #kot# as for now
[ah] india but maybe <malay>bila umur dah lima puluh nanti</malay> [lah] #boulogne# and [lah]
(mm) <malay>selain tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi yang</malay> tesla <malay>buat</malay>
the space flight <malay>yang</malay> you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
running [eh]
[kan] they <malay>dia buat dia buat</malay> this (err) flight flight system <malay>baru yang mana</malay> you can travel across the world in less than three hours <malay>ke</malay> two hours [a'ah]
so I don't know if that is still running <malay>sebab dia nak</malay>
<malay>buat</malay>
<malay>benda tu</malay> affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years <malay>ke</malay>
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!
<malay>balik hari</malay> [jer] <malay>pun boleh</malay>
!wah! long silence very long silence
(uh huh) death to two thousand twenty
I <malay>suka</malay> that documentary
centric <malay>tapi</malay> understandable [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> creator <malay>dia pun</malay> from
but I think it's a good mockumentary [lah] to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam</malay> what do you want
and
you <malay>dah cakap</malay> you stoic so I <malay>dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu</malay>
(mm)

be your younger self
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> change
(mm)

(mm) I <malay>faham</malay>
(mm)
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think I learn more
<malay>kat rumah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dekat dekat</malay> internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually <malay>kat</malay> okay I mean form five <malay>pun</malay> I don't have
and I <malay>tak pakai</malay>
<malay>hujung</malay> form five I <malay>pakai</malay> iphone but before that I <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use [ah] but I
I <malay>lebih</malay> I I understand <malay>bila ayah yang ajar</malay>
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
<malay>kena ambil</malay> to TOEFL [lah] <malay>lagi sekali</malay>
I think that will help a lot
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so <malay>dia</malay> expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until <malay>dia</malay> expire <malay>macam</malay> the last time I <malay>ambil rugi</malay> [jer]
[ah]
then <malay>sia-sia</malay> even if you <malay>dapat</malay> offer travel while once you <malay>nak masuk dia akan minta balik</malay> your TOEFL <malay>punya sijil</malay> then you have to take again
(mmhmm)
two thousand twenty one <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> start of the decade [kan]
<malay>bukan yang</malay> two thousand twenty [kan] last year was the ending
this [one] is the beginning okay
[a'ah] <malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks
<malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks but nothing happen
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] I like new beginnings (um)
I <malay>pun takde</malay> expectation
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
<malay>tinggal lapan minit</malay>
that that [one] quite fast <malay>tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah</malay>
[oh]
<malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>harap</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't have any
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
poll <malay>sekarang</malay>
like <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak dia</malay> from <malay>semua benda sebab</malay>
in a way
I <malay>tak rasa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tadi cakap</malay> [lah] [ah]
afterlife <malay>punya benda kita tak tahu</malay> and it's not within our control [kan] <malay>dan ni pun sama</malay> it's not within my control so whatever happens happens [lah]
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
<malay>apa pun yang dia orang buat</malay> I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
you have yourself and people around you
<malay>tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I I'm quite positive about
this year
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> hopeless <malay>sangat</malay>
it's been awhile since I <malay>rasa</malay> hopeless <malay>dengan</malay>
the whole <malay>tahun</malay>
so you
institution
religion
<malay>agama kaum</malay>
[oh] <malay>kaum</malay> is a very sensitive issue
(mmhmm)
and I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> Facebook comment
<malay>dia</malay> almost <malay>macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu</malay> you don't have any feelings at all
[ah] <malay>bangsa malas membaca</malay>
<malay>lepas tu tajuk</malay> everything click bait
[ah] I wish that <malay>kena</malay> change
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> change
[ah]
(mm)
but journalism <malay>yang</malay> spark head
<malay>orang yang malas membaca tu</malay> ya <malay>malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun</malay> they have to click in order to know the
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> nurse <malay>yang</malay> nurse <malay>yang yang ni</malay> infected <malay>tu dekat</malay> <malay>yang vaksin</malay> (mm) (mm)
(mm)
and then <malay>kismis dan</malay>
that's my vaccine !wah!
(mm) <malay>tapi yang</malay> news <malay>pasal</malay> nurse <malay>tu</malay> very misleading <malay>sebab</malay> even if you take your first vaccine <malay>untuk dia sampai ke</malay> fifty percent immunity <malay>tu dia ambil dua minggu</malay>
<malay>dia kena</malay> COVID within I think <malay>hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu</malay> it's not even two full weeks yet and even <malay>kalau dah</malay> two full weeks <malay>pun</malay> not a full total immunity
second shot <malay>baru ni tapi</malay>
<malay>orang malas membaca</malay>
<malay>dia buat orang takut untuk buat benda yang betul</malay>
and <malay>lagi pun</malay> journalisms <malay>sekarang</malay> mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then <malay>jadi satu bentuk berita</malay> [ah] <malay>yang penting ada</malay> content ya monetisation and <malay>yang penting duit jalan</malay> K
<malay>tapi</malay> content <malay>memang tak</malay> best <malay>langsung</malay> especially because the audience <malay>dalam</malay> Twitter and <malay>dalam</malay> Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
(mm)
[oh] <malay>dah ni</malay>
<malay>lagi satu minit</malay> there's only one minute left
[ah] <malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> settle you click right [ah] tick [ah]
(mm)
okay [lah] <malay>macam tak rasa sangat</malay> can speak one hour <malay>macam tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] I wish I wish we can talk about something new [lah] (mm)
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K [lah] thank you
okay

<malay>penat</malay> <malay>entah macam</malay> okay one of the reason [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> secondary school <malay>dengan</malay> primary school <malay>dah habis sekolah</malay> [tau] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah nak masuk</malay> holiday mindset <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>abeh tapi</malay> poly <malay>masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>lagipun</malay> during this period [ah] the exams are like
the exams are like cut off about
<malay>nak kena apa jaga</malay> safe distancing [kan] so like the exams are out so most of our
exam are replaced with (err) graded assignments
so <malay>macam</malay> and most of the time [kan] my graded assignment <malay>semua kena buat</malay> report and for report confirm <malay>nak kena buat</malay> research <malay>banyak</malay>
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a <malay>banyak benda</malay> [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>dah habis sekolah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat</malay> and <malay>nak balik rumah</malay> one hour journey <malay>macam</malay> just the thought about it <malay>dah buat aku penat</malay> and when I came home
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday [ah] [ah]
I submit [lah] but it was like [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
half half <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> fifty percent <malay>punya</malay> reflection journal [a'ah] ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh</malay> like
like you saw [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I just <malay>macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis</malay> !oi!
[eh] but your poly days <malay>macam lagi rabak</malay> because
you design [tau] like
like creativity like (err) <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
no because three point one is more of <malay>macam</malay> internship [tau] and these tuesday <malay>ada</malay> briefing on the internship [ah] and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [eh] because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced <malay>kau macam</malay> put it in a beautiful way
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> just the thought of (um) having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
[ah]
(hmm)
(um)
but you know what (uh) I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean (err) ya it was at home so like but quite like <malay>mendak macam</malay> like (err) no (err) so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that <malay>yang</malay> assigned <malay>dia</malay> through
zoom or [ah] microsoft teams
[oh] she is (uh) in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
[ah] work from school even internship [eh] [ah] ya from home I mean
[ah] so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
I don't know [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> elaborate [ah] but but yeah it was mostly a research
and like even but then right
<malay>dia datang</malay> for like one two days first two days [leh] then the period starts
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work [what]
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that [what]
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first [kan] orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building <malay>tapi</malay> for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then (um)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so like and [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> like most of my <malay>kawan yang</malay> year ones
<malay>dorang</malay> like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the [ah] school <malay>punya</malay> website
so <malay>macam</malay>
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right [kan] so <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
how am I supposed to <malay>berbual</malay> with this person <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
actually diff races okay [lah]
no [lah] I <malay>berbual</malay> english because by the time right for my batch <malay>dah banyak ada yang ambil</malay> tamil <malay>gini semua</malay>
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly ya but
but I didn't regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly because like because certain things <malay>macam</malay> how
okay so <malay>aku macam</malay> old schools <malay>sikit</malay> computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how <malay>kental</malay> I am
ya so <malay>diam</malay> so [ah] so <malay>bila masuk</malay> poly <malay>tiba-tiba dah kena buat</malay> [ah] share document and all that then I was like <malay>apa ni apa ni</malay> I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma [ah] outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
like I don't know I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if I think that <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like !huh! <malay>apa ni</malay> like what am I supposed to do there [ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>kau tak bilang aku</malay>
[oh] you mean secondary school or what
[oh] primary five then I still in the kindergarten [lah]
no wonder <malay>kau selalu pergi</malay> library I thought it was to like to <malay>baca buku</malay> no
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay [ah]
since I'm already eighteen right so <malay>macam</malay> some some things that actually almost all of the things [kan] <malay>kau</malay> <malay>kat aku</malay>
but at that point of time I was
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa</malay> because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things <malay>daripada mami dan</malay> #abi# <malay>macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda</malay> everything first hand <malay>aku selalu dapat</malay> second or third hand <malay>aku macam</malay> I was kind of jealous at that point of time <malay>tapi</malay> that
I
<malay>macam dengar</malay> like what's like actually what happened actually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] not deserved [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
not deserve [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] deserve [lah] <malay>sikit</malay> deserve [lah]
messenger
<malay>macam</malay> messenger facebook
true [lah]
eighteen [oh] ya
(hmm)
[oh] secondary three secondary four okay so <malay>macam</malay>
okay firstly [kan] since [ah] okay so the teachers <malay>pun macam tahu</malay> [ah] like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates <malay>semua macam</malay> [ah] heck care <malay>macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni</malay> just it was that bad (uh) like even like teacher <malay>pun macam</malay> what
why is this class not like taking it seriously
<malay>tapi</malay> for me right
<malay>aku pun macam</malay>
why not have fun <malay>macam macam</malay> this is the last few days <malay>sebelum</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like some <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> ya
not something to be like
a good memory [lah] so like our class <malay>macam</malay> quite
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> act <malay>serabak dorang</malay> [lah] like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
like absent for like out of five days [leh]
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
[ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
I had to do most of the things that <malay>macam</malay>
like attendance [ah] keep track of <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dah hantar</malay> acknowledgement slip or whatsoever [ah] so and most of the time even the teachers know that [ah]
(uh) ya so even the teachers know that [ah] anytime like they had to
<malay>macam tanya</malay> monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one <malay>yang akan</malay> represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
it was that bad so <malay>macam</malay> all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students [ah] twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious [lah]
like to be honest for me right
<malay>tak ada satu pun yang layak</malay>
<malay>tak ada satu pun</malay> [ah] <malay>terpaksa</malay> [ah] [ah]
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one [lah] the four years [lah] it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like <malay>kakak</malay> was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time (err) I don't know [leh] because [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like they most of the teacher point out [ah] like I am so different from you and <malay>abang</malay> ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what <malay>macam</malay> ya no matter what [ah]
<malay>aku akan</malay> avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like (err) for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then (um)
for that grade I got a
B three I don't want to tell you <malay>tak payah</malay> [ah] so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us <malay>dah macam</malay> go through many things so like and sec three sec four <malay>ada macam</malay> project <malay>macam masa tu ada</malay> this international is a <malay>apa</malay> humanitarian job [ah] so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising [lah] so like almost like everyday <malay>kita orang</malay> stay back and <malay>macam</malay> pop up <malay>macam</malay> this one booth <malay>kita orang jual air jual roti jual</malay> pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> and had a lot of fun [lah] then <malay>bila</malay> secondary four okay by the time secondary four <malay>semua orang dah tahu</malay> that is going to be the last year and this is the last time <malay>untuk macam</malay> rebel [ah] <malay>bukan</malay> rebel [ah] as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow [ah] <malay>macam</malay> and since <malay>kita orang dah tahu</malay> is our last year [kan] <malay>semua orang makin rapat</malay>
then (um)
and then so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
even when <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the teachers like complain about us and then our class <malay>macam</malay> [ah] it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
<malay>macam</malay> this class <malay>macam</malay> !hais! this class like [ah] [ah]
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us (err) pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy (err) male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like [oh] my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like (err) on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear <malay>punya</malay> height
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> everytime right I will like <malay>gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek</malay> then <malay>sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>geram</malay> [ah] but this kind of memories like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in (uh)
poly diploma in (uh) arabic private school so
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days <malay>macam</malay> it's just like
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
[oh] [oh] ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard [ah] vanguard
[oh]
[oh]
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
[ah] because for my primary school like
like they like
[ah] separate into our six six
A B C D E F [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class [ah]
but then like for the lower class right <malay>dorang</malay> like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing <malay>kesian juga macam</malay> like everyone <malay>akan tengok</malay> ya but then but the thing I hated the most because <malay>kita orang</malay> the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because <malay>kita orang macam macam</malay> [ah] okay [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> apex camp no I am more of a person of <malay>yang tak suka</malay> interact <malay>bukan</malay> antisocial
I don't label myself as antisocial
<malay>cuma</malay> I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group [ah]
<malay>kau</malay> hold grudge [eh]
[oh] she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
[oh] [oh] okay okay
[oh] no
so means <malay>dorang</malay> stay back longer than <malay>kau</malay> stay back [ah]
[oh]
then issac was six
[oh] then why didn't you like <malay>cakap</malay> to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six <malay>punya kerja</malay>
[oh] primary six [oh] [oh] but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
[oh] that clip okay
so you had to like
[oh]
but did you realise everytime during camp or <malay>macam</malay> stay over <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
like most of us are <malay>macam tak tidur</malay>
[oh] <malay>korang tidur</malay> [eh]
[oh] no because for my batch right <malay>macam</malay> everytime <malay>kalau ada macam ada</malay> #qiyam# or <malay>macam macam</malay> sleep <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
<malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>malam</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang tak tidur</malay>
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys [ah]
<malay>kita orang kita orang</malay> (uh) <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level three the boys <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level one but then [ah] #toa payoh#
I mean like canteen
[ah] okay so [ah] so but then <malay>kita orang dekat</malay> level three <malay>kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual</malay> [ah] with the girls [ah] <malay>kita orang berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> gossip something like that
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
like <malay>dekat</malay> parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand <malay>kita orang macam</malay> curious [ah] like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning [oh] one [lah]
then <malay>kita orang semua</malay> gather <malay>abeh tengok</malay> like

it was a punishment
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari</malay> to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did [ah] but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like <malay>tak tidur</malay> so the rest <malay>kena</malay> punishment but then right I think the male teachers like <malay>macam</malay>
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep <malay>macam tak terganggu</malay> with any check
[oh] ya

of the another car park <malay>yang sebelah</malay> Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so <malay>macam</malay> [eh]

ya okay
so
(um) not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
<malay>kejap</malay> okay <malay>tak apa</malay> if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
portrait malay portrait of you
!oi! if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
(um) cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at (uh) one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really (um)
check and (um) keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
!wah! ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
(mm)
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
<malay>kalau betul</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba kau dengan dia</malay> together malay malay if <malay>kalau betul kau dengan dia</malay> together
and if if this is like a (uh) continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games [lah] bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
<malay>dah dah dah dah</malay> that's right (err)
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please [lah] muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so <malay>kalau</malay> if if <malay>kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia</malay> and <malay>kau kau macam</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay>
[eh] <malay>kau kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>aku suka berbual dengan kau</malay>
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that [eh] she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
[ah] see [lah] all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted [mah] so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like [eh] !siala! why she talk like that she want me flirt to her [ah] (oo) #la# #la# so that's when <malay>kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> ya exactly <malay>kau tak nak berbual aku</malay> [pe] <malay>kau</malay> busy <malay>sangat</malay> [pe] I'm not that important
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts [ah] denial
okay <malay>dengar dulu</malay> so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird <malay>dah dah dah</malay>
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy [lah] so it's fine K stop [oh] shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
(um)
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit [lah] bro like
ya ya you have to
no <malay>tak</malay> when you meet him
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
!huh! okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive [what]
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya [lah] if never take care [lor]
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon [lah]
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
[ah] sorry [lah] it's fucking sus [lah] it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no [lah] for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like [oh] that's why we [ah] got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
like gap [lah] <malay>macam</malay> he probably thinks that <malay>kau macam lagi kaya</malay> or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying <malay>macam</malay>
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting [what] right
acting [eh] <malay>macam kau</malay> self-realisation <malay>padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde</malay>
no like is it like <malay>macam</malay> is it
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck [oh] my god
[oh] my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder <malay>atau</malay> (uh) Okcupid
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one [ah]
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of (um) naive girls because you really really go through <malay>macam</malay>
to to the tee <malay>punya macam</malay> this [one] really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
(hmm) I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app [lah] correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's #amin# which guy
#amin# <malay>abeh</malay> #amin#
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say <malay>tak nak kau</malay> you won't <malay>kau tak akan</malay> break up <malay>dengan mata air kau</malay> just to <malay>lepak dengan budak</malay> #syafiq# <malay>ni</malay> that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say [ah] <malay>buat apa</malay>
<malay>sorang-sorang buat apa</malay>
is there drama now with you and #amin#
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive [ah] listen [ah] okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me [oh] I'm talking to this fella (um)
and then after I say okay (um)
how did you meet her
and then after that [oh] through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
(uh) fate [eh] that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
#platonically# as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
because I don't like you <malay>atau</malay> you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money <malay>aku kasi</malay> (uh) I <malay>aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit</malay>
<malay>atau dia bagi kau</malay> knowledge <malay>dia tak bagi kau</malay> opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already [what] then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect [meh] to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and [ah] if you want to talk about F (uh) [ah] friends friends I got a lot of friends #lan jiao# [lah] must be one of them must be your date [meh]
like you don't have any workmates [meh] you don't you're not motivated in life
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to <malay>lepak</malay>
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no [lah] it's bullshit [lah] if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it [meh]
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
would would not get mad with you [meh] he will get mad [what] <malay>pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang</malay> and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit [eh] if let's say you went out with this fella and with
#syafiq# the one that you never date what #amin# #syafiq# okay so #amin# is the one you date before
so if you went out with #amin# and #syafiq# okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you [ah] [eh] just break up [ah]
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit [eh] like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
if #syafiq# keeps telling you [eh] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] when the first meeting problem starts with [eh] I didn't before [sia] there's there's gonna be this part of like
[eh] I got talk to her before I got date her before [oh] now she talking to that guy [ah]
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
(mm) [ah] you (mm) [ah] (mm) (mm)
because you are you trying to say that [oh] he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya [lah] me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this #syafiq# [eh] no #akim# guy #akim# #akim# you need to just
play your game well just say [lor] like
flirt to text not to sext
I would say because <malay>dia</malay> very religious [kan] <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>cakap macam</malay> just playfully flirt [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
things that make him feel like [oh] she really wants my attention like [eh] <malay>kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> [eh] <malay>dah lama tak rindu</malay> [seh] or something like that so
it's not <malay>haram</malay> [what] I mean okay it is <malay>haram</malay> because you have the intention but then
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so [ah] shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be [eh] he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten [what] right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K #chao#
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go [what]
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating [mah] officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using [ah] but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say [ah] people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart [lah] for me for me is like
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like <malay>macam</malay> step (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> [eh] (uh) like you can flirt [lah] but then like
at least have the sense of (um) intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that (uh) you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
<malay>faham tak</malay> it's so many red flags sorry but
[eh] [eh] (uh) no if I were you
I would further <malay>macam</malay> I would pursue him
for me to find out more red flags
so
!wah!
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
<malay>faham tak</malay> so <malay>bila kau dah macam</malay> together <malay>dengan dia</malay> not not if let's say he starts to
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one [ah] like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
like it's either you are a good boy <malay>atau</malay> you are manipulative
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine [eh] if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
for real !huh! <malay>dia hantar</malay> you portrait <malay>kimak budak-budak kental</malay> [pe] [sia] confirm <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird [what] it's fucking weird bro
you <malay>kena</malay> cheated also [eh] we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
I'm not trying to (uh) anyhow to do [ah] but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
[oh] so his relationship was like three years [ah]
#pukiwek# three years <malay>abeh kena</malay> cheated [eh] !siala!
with the first girl
#kiwek# okay [lah]
then he got single then he dated that girl
(uh huh)
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no [lah] with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
[oh] so she state it when
okay okay then
correct (um) so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
(um)
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like <malay>macam</malay>
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up [ah] bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this (uh) this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch [mah]
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
<malay>kawan aku</malay> legit <malay>bila aku kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>dia memang betul</malay> religious <malay>habis</malay> the family and very <malay>baik</malay> so
shy <malay>baik</malay> and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary [lah] for you to just <malay>macam</malay> socialise [what]
then (um)
she's the type that don't even wear <malay>tudung depan</malay> (uh) <malay>pakcik makcik</malay>
so legit [eh] <malay>ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung</malay> that kind of thing <malay>atau macam</malay>
[eh] (uh) <malay>berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut</malay> so when when she go out with these kind of (uh) men (uh)
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
(um) <malay>pasal</malay> everyday they remind themselves [ah] [oh] <malay>jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk</malay> that's fucking true let's be real <malay>macam</malay> and and that's why to me
(um) (uh) asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch [what] you should know the criteria [what] as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain [what] because if you don't get the girl then shut up [lah] so
in my head is like (um) if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and <malay>haram</malay> is not for you
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
<malay>kau masih nak</malay> try try try <malay>tapi kau tak</malay> up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is (um)
how do I say this [ah] everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so <malay>macam</malay>
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why <malay>sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu</malay> so if she she say she don't want it then <malay>kalau</malay> (um)
he should know better [what] right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch [sia] this is not like <malay>macam remeh-temeh</malay> girl [tau] it's not like <malay>macam</malay>
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded [tau] you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than (uh) if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for me to and not because like [eh] <malay>aku</malay> no no no I mean my gift #alhamdulillah# is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
(um) (uh) how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man <malay>faham tak</malay>
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like <malay>macam</malay> you're going through a lot of (uh) problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like [eh] family <malay>aku</malay> my family is (uh) (uh) poor I mean (uh) <malay>mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>itu aku boleh bagi</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> #buto# <malay>kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak</malay> complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like <malay>macam</malay>
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
and like <malay>macam</malay> I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
(uh) I'm blinded that was the one <malay>yang dengan</malay> the arab guy that I was with <malay>yang macam aku betul-betul sayang</malay> but <malay>dia macam</malay>
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like [oh] fuck I'm a malay I cannot [eh] shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
like <malay>dalam</malay> islam <malay>pun cakap</malay> a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so <malay>cakap dengan dia gitu</malay> maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that <malay>kalau kau nak macam</malay> if you play by insecurity saying that !aiya! <malay>aku tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku ni buruk aku tahu</malay> [lah]
and then <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [sial] <malay>macam</malay> do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that <malay>kena</malay> burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like <malay>macam</malay> ya so
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry <malay>aku macam</malay> really that's that's weird
<malay>macam</malay>
it's weird [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird [lah] unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame [what] like
how to say [ah] it's weird it's weird unless <malay>kau macam</malay>
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
fan mail then legit <malay>kena</malay> call fan [sia] fan I also want to vomit [sia] !huh! <malay>kau</malay> fanatic <malay>dia ni</malay> when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
no you should tell him straight [ah] [eh] <malay>kimak kau</malay> lame [pe] <malay>kau hantar perempuan gini</malay> that means before <malay>aku kau hantar perempuan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay>
what the fuck do you do with your free time <malay>kau</malay> scroll <malay>perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar</malay> portrait
did you know what I'm saying
[ah] so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that <malay>kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh</malay> steady <malay>punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka</malay>
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording [ah]
they need to type [ah] their to
[ah] transcript !huh! portrait copy paste copy paste
<malay>faham tak</malay>
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
once you date me you die already you die already all my my <malay>macam</malay> bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already [what] I'm abusive [what] back then [lah] you know like I don't give a like bro <malay>aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak</malay> [sia] <malay>muka kau pun aku boleh pecah</malay> [kan] [sia] and as a guy also
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
#chao# if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
who the fuck <malay>macam</malay> owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father [lah] but not your partner <malay>faham tak</malay> so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like <malay>kau dah</malay> mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy <malay>masuk</malay> jail <malay>cakap</malay> once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn [eh]
in jail [eh] say once I get past my O levels I will marry (uh) and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is weird let's see <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet [ah]
that is what I used to [what] that's a fucking pattern [what] you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
<malay>faham tak</malay> cause
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards [ah] but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
[oh] whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot [lah] because not twenty twenty vision [mah] put braces [mah] my eyes
ya so that's why <malay>aku cakap kau</malay> it it all takes time [what] people especially when you like someone bro
they lie people lie
and you've never been he been been (uh) at his lowest point of (uh) point in his life have you ever be that <malay>kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak</malay>
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
[oh] maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking (um) pursue a better goal
you fucking tell me <malay>engkau</malay> then <malay>apa diam</malay> [ah] [sial] then you want you have a better goal [lah] like it's simple as that <malay>macam</malay>
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn (uh) like maybe because
how to say [ah] when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say [ah] for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
(uh) dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
(uh) that that that that's where I play my game <malay>faham tak</malay> of like
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like [oh] you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
(um) like I have a lot to work on but
I pick my battle [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay this guy is enough for me
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
tell you before [leh] fuck bro <malay>kimak aku punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>perempuan hantar dia macam</malay>
[eh] I saw you around school you look cute <malay>aku maki</malay> [sia] #buto# <malay>siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok</malay> you <malay>buat apa dia pasal</malay> what
cause he's fucking fat !wah! fuck you #chibai# want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up [ah] want to look at my boyfriend for what
#buto# I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
<malay>faham tak</malay>
<malay>asal kau</malay> you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
[oh] anytime if I want to cut you off which is good [lah] I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping [ah]
(mm) (mm)
correct so
<malay>bapa aku</malay> [sia] <malay>nama bapa aku</malay> [sial]
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck [ah]
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work [meh]
ya isn't that good
!huh!
but then
[ah] that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you <malay>kalau</malay>
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick [lah] !huh! looks and also (um)
not status looks and (um) body language
when that is okay then after that your your
(uh) no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence <malay>punya</malay>
(mm) test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this (uh) and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner (uh) (uh) toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
wait but then saturday sunday <malay>kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia</malay>
okay ya then then just hang with them like <malay>macam</malay> you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
stop it like <malay>macam</malay> if you tell your if tell your [oh] my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I went out with this girl I <malay>tak pernah</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay>
<malay>dia gila-gila</malay> [kan] I <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
but you reciprocate
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that [oh] this girl got got <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt [what] right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she him and saying that [oh] you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend [what] but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that (um)
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that [lah] but he said as like <malay>macam</malay> okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I #simplicate# whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay [lor] then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like <malay>macam</malay> (um)
help with <malay>ke apa</malay> #lan jiao#
go ahead with it or whatever <malay>kalau macam nak tanya</malay> advice about <malay>macam kerja</malay> in the future <malay>ke apa</malay> go ahead with it but I'm not
going to allow you to meet her face to face and and it just gives
like <malay>macam</malay> is not more of like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you <malay>ada keluar dengan dia tak</malay> you <malay>pernah keluar dengan dia tak</malay> I was fond of him [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pernah mata air dengan dia</malay>
what like you reciprocate like it's more nicer to hear that [oh]
my boyfriend is the first guy that I asked out but then you should not
put so much weight into your your decisions people make mistakes if he's not the one you shouldn't be like [eh] he's the first guy I asked
okay
okay okay okay okay contradicting [ah] okay
good [lah] then then
you sure okay if you feel like you in denial right really make believe
make believe that like
no make believe when when when the right time so when you want to flirt with him right think of it
okay I'm your friend [what] so it's not wrong for me to say this but then when when after that he say some fucked up shit right
turn back and be like [eh] but this is the fella that I want to might want to date okay I must like attack him back
but you know you get what I'm saying like you have to play smart
spy

<malay>itu pun salah</malay>
okay [lah] so <malay>jadi</malay> over there I should get like the maggi <malay>goreng</malay> combo
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there [lah] cause more of nature so many insects
I (um) my sister she used to [lah] she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
(uh) no <malay>ada dah dah habis dah</malay> she ya I think if <malay>sekarang</malay> I think is every friday I think the
the <malay>cerita</malay> is (uh) I think is called
<malay>lesung</malay> if I'm not wrong you can try you can try (uh) tune in every friday <malay>dekat</malay> #suria#
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
like I feel like I watch once a month <malay>sahaja</malay> no [lah] I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix <malay>ke</malay> Viu or YouTube <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
now now I <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tengok apa-apa</malay> cause I like actually I am busy
like morning <malay>kerja</malay> then
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
<malay>bangun makan tidur</malay> kind of thing you know
if you not a if you just like (um) afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school !haiyo!
!huh!
!wow! I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try [lah] try to be on time [lah] it's school it's important
me graduate
(uh) still still <malay>lama lagi</malay> I think now like
I started school (err) this year april
so it's only been how many months
(uh) few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
(hmm) looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so [lah]
then [eh] you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
[oh]
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
(mm) I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
!wow! then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
(uh) that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
(uh) no I take care of myself very well
(um) like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
[ah] like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know <malay>cari nahas</malay>
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay [lah] since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
[oh] really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
[oh] good [lah]
(hmm) nevermind [lah]
like
right now [oh] you heard about like
(uh) I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
!huh! you <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
[oh]
it's okay [lah] we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
(uh) I really
really cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already people really need to follow like
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good [lah] you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
!wah! I really I like [oh] yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know (uh)
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
[ah] every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
[oh] !wah! everything you want to do with your friend [ah] then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
[oh] (uh) you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
(uh) government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure [lah] but like what it can be use for
[ah] cannot be anything I'm sure like <malay>mesti dia macam</malay>
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
ya but you can only use your own voucher I think you must add up with <malay>pakai</malay> cash
relax what you so stress about
!wah! talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like (uh) allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
go #sentosa# <malay>untuk apa</malay>
swim [oh] (uh) have you like you know (uh) #sentosa# also there's a lot of like
(uh) activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
(uh) [oh] I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
(uh) trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because (uh) apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same [lah]
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
<malay>dia naik habis</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
(uh) I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you [lah]
what <malay>tak ada kena mengena</malay> car and roller coaster
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try [lah] I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
!wow! that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands !huh!

ya I'm amazed that like
people <malay>boleh bahagi masa dia orang</malay> to to be into this

get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
so let's let's just <malay>tahan</malay> a bit
like you know there's you people say <malay>macam</malay> (uh) there's like there's a
is it
rain before sunshine

ya can't wait can't wait to get like
(uh) like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay [lah] let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much

career or our education

it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to <malay>apa apa apa</malay> you know then

my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to <malay>tegur</malay> like that then you just like !alamak! <malay>dia ni lagi</malay> then
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] F&B but now no more [ah]
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like <malay>macam</malay> change of heart
then I want to find another industry to work at
<malay>dah tua</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> tiring [ah] events
then also
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why I I end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> temperature screener [kan] <malay>dekat kedai tu</malay> [kan]
then <malay>dia orang kata mesti ada</malay> diploma then I'm like
<malay>susah sangat ke</malay> temperature screener you know like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>tak</malay> makes sense [ah] I think <malay>dia orang macam sengaja nak</malay>
<malay>buat susah</malay> you know then they complain like you know [oh] nobody want to apply <malay>padahal</malay>
I don't know [ah] what's going on also
(mm) depends [ah]
they said
(mm)
ya [lor] recently I got a job offer

<malay>kerja apa</malay> (uh) teaching
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> but I got (um) <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom <malay>gitu</malay>
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya I
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (uh)
ya then now also like <malay>nak</malay> classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like <malay>macam</malay>
every hour <malay>kena</malay> sanitise <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like (ugh)
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
then <malay>macam malas gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but this one <malay>dia</malay> toxic [ah] the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the management [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ngada-ngada</malay> [ah] I don't know how to say
[ah]
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
then like the first three days the management <malay>tak datang</malay> so I'm like okay [ah] this job like not bad [ah] I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] can manage [lah] you know not so
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
(um) <malay>tengok</malay> how I work [lah] you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then <malay>dia orang</malay>
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] I don't know [ah] then
ya she damn <malay>cari pasal</malay> [ah] like with me like <malay>semua benda yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> which I think is like
not even her problem <malay>dia macam tak</malay> okay

because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]

then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
if I know everything why I training right like <malay>bodoh</malay> [pe] <malay>perempuan ni</malay>
ya
<malay>apa</malay>
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
(uh) then then I know what he what they she roughly mean [ah] I don't get like everything but I <malay>boleh faham sikit-sikit</malay> [ah]
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
<malay>aku baru</malay> then <malay>aku tak tahu apa-apa</malay> you know things like that then I'm like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
or is it the next day or something like that then she like <malay>tegur</malay> me [ah] she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like [eh] <malay>kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kau orang nak</malay> test <malay>aku</malay>
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed [lah] because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
I know how to do [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) I think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
(uh) you don't know anything so I (uh) that time I'm just like <malay>malas</malay> [seh] <malay>nak datang balik</malay>
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>biar dia cari orang lain</malay>
you want <malay>kira</malay> work from home [ah] I don't want [seh]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] I was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because I got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now I I see like <malay>macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua</malay> I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] I guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
my friends <malay>semua macam</malay> introvert <malay>dengan</malay> homebody <malay>juga</malay> so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to <malay>jumpa</malay> right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
too wild too long in that's why I'm like <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents <malay>dia orang macam nak</malay> my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] I think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) I'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] I guess then my sister she <malay>macam</malay>
she attached <malay>dengan</malay> muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
<malay>macam sekarang</malay> right I was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like <malay>macam</malay>
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) recently [kan] I <malay>baca kat</malay>
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook <malay>gitu semua</malay>
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right <malay>macam kalau kita</malay> relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all <malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
(mm)
is it
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
<malay>apa</malay>
sorry what
(uh) <malay>tak</malay> I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know <malay>rajin-rajin</malay> in the kitchen then <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married <malay>gitu</malay> you know but then I'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much <malay>kalau tahu</malay> I just
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
<malay>apa ni</malay>
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
like #chiongster# also [lah] <malay>kerja banyak</malay> and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five <malay>kita kena dah</malay> married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
<malay>kita pun ada cakap</malay> [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law <malay>macam</malay>
like have a lot of expectations of her <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
(mm)
but sometimes <malay>kecoh</malay> is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of <malay>kecoh</malay>
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she <malay>cakap dia tak nak</malay> [ah] she <malay>nak cari rumah sendiri juga</malay>
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know <malay>hari raya</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> like <malay>rumah kat</malay> #jurong# then <malay>mesti ada kucing punya</malay> I don't know [ah] I don't know how to say ya
ya
I never say [ah] <malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> [eh]
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#

small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya

<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because I want to lean [ah] because I <malay>malas</malay>
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the <malay>kerja</malay> is like so far away from your <malay>rumah</malay> then it's like (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang mo kio# like <malay>macam</malay> nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon</malay> then <malay>dia orang ketawa</malay> like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
<malay>apa</malay>
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] <malay>macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu</malay>
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
<malay>sebab dia nak jadi</malay> teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at <malay>punya</malay> kind of school
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't <malay>kerja</malay> you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
say before that he is <malay>macam</malay>
like when he got school [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay>
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it I think is is <malay>macam</malay> charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] <malay>cina</malay> [lah]
(uh) #qian jin# is a
actually I don't
I don't know [ah] like when back then like cause I was your age not so long ago (um)
I was workaholic also [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so I'm just like
whatever [lah] actually I was kind of those kind like [oh] I I independent woman I <malay>tak nak kahwin tak nak</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> children all then in the end
I met him then I was like actually we can click [ah] then like so we fall
like in love so like not I'm in a relationship
so I don't know what to do with that dream
(mm)
what
online [lah]
[a'ah]
<malay>saje</malay> [jer] like you know like
like
try try cause nowadays got <malay>macam banyak</malay> apps <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] you know and websites also
so just make friends [ah] because I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
my age [kan] like <malay>orang semua dah kahwin</malay> then <malay>dia orang macam tak nak</malay> hang out so much
so I was like trying to like meet new people like of same interests as me you know
then

I suddenly meet him then suddenly like [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] actually like if we get married and have a life together <malay>macam</malay> fun <malay>gitu juga</malay> [eh] ya so

<malay>tak semua</malay> I watch #bondi# rescue
#bondi# rescue
<malay>kau tau</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> that #bondi# rescue thirteen season it's to the point that <malay>aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi</malay> lifeguard
(uh) #bondi# rescue is like (mm) <malay>kau</malay> lifeguard so basically you just <malay>jaga</malay> this beach <malay>kau</malay>
no it's not really bay watch this [one] is really real life they're not paid to do o
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday <malay>punya</malay>
no but you know it's very how to say [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam dia puaskan hati kau</malay> [tau] <malay>yang bila diorang</malay> actually
get to save people from drowning
inspire me ya something like that because <malay>aku tengok</malay> [kan] this one season [kan] they <malay>diorang</malay> fail to <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) save this couple [tau] old couple
they are in their seventies <malay>kalau tak salah aku</malay> they only managed to save
<malay>dia ada tiga orang</malay> this couple <malay>dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan</malay> in-laws [lah]
he recalled already buys it architecture in large bigger deeper eight to mature
<malay>kirakan adik ipar</malay> is it <malay>aku pun tak sure</malay>
as in as in brother in-law
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>abang ipar</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>melayu</malay> fail
so basically <malay>diorang bila diorang</malay> [dah] save this <malay>tiga orang</malay> [kan] no <malay>diorang</malay> save <malay>satu aje dahulu</malay> because lifeguards <malay>kat situ empat orang</malay> in duty
three of them just go there and save <malay>kalau ada orang</malay> drown <malay>lagi</malay> how
so basically
in the water face down
float
ya
ya
downing [ah]
<malay>diorang nangis</malay> actually because they couldn't save
<malay>diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu</malay> [kan]
but it's so you know I actually cried you know
<malay>aku nangis</malay> because <malay>aku tengok diorang</malay> actually trying to revive that that couple back
really <malay>diorang</malay> really like went all out
they do is it
<malay>betul</malay> [ah]
ya you know how many minutes not thirty minutes just to revive the person back
that's why they cry because they try so hard <malay>tapi</malay> they try to actually <malay>macam</malay> cover themself up [ah] because <malay>diorang tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>diorang</malay> being
ya so they
ya
<malay>tapi banyak orang</malay> like surrounding <malay>diorang macam</malay> like kind of like <malay>macam</malay> blaming them for not doing their job properly <malay>macam</malay> couldn't rescue them on time
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] <malay>kerja kau</malay> as a lifeguard <malay>kau ada empat</malay> like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me <malay>pada aku</malay> is just so sad

sixty dollars <malay>ke</malay> hundred dollars <malay>ke</malay> but
!alamak! it's about I think they say four hundred four hundred dollar plus your bicycle how much [ah]
and we can you imagine you <malay>tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu</malay> at the house waiting where is my food !alamak! then find out the the rider bicycle <malay>pancit</malay> or the wheel
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[ah] <malay>pecah ke apa</malay> then like quite wasted [lah] if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
[oh] ya [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> drivers <malay>kalau nampak orang</malay> bicycle they will try to try to <malay>apa tu</malay> drive very near to the bicycle ya [lah] I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes <malay>terlupa</malay> that [eh] you guys are on the road
and there are buses <malay>ada apa tu</malay> lorry <malay>ada</malay> motorcycles <malay>semua</malay> so next time just be more careful [lah] <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] before you <malay>pusing</malay> you <malay>tengok apa apa tu</malay> blind spot check back check back [eh] check back whether there any vehicles around you [ah]
okay okay then you <malay>tadi</malay> morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right <malay>kat</malay> where again <malay>kat mana</malay> the #ubi# #ubi# #eunos# there right is it
[ah] so you <malay>macam tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia punya</malay> dangers and stuff
so next time when you [dah] <malay>dapat</malay> license your motorbike licence <malay>ke</malay> car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see [eh] got one cyclist coming or [eh] got one cyclists behind me you know [lah] to be more careful
[eh] wait wait that means you on which practical five [eh] <malay>lima</malay>
[ah] okay okay okay before [oh] ya prac five <malay>yang</malay> you have to do everything in the circuit then <malay>kalau</malay> pass prac six then only can go out at the road
(uh) okay <malay>tapi</malay> one thing about #ubi# [eh] cause I took my license there at #ubi# also
that <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] when I when I took my license <malay>apa tu</malay> #ubi# [ah] very crowded so you just be very careful [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> especially when you first time <malay>keluar naik</malay> road
there's a lot of lorries also so listen to what the instructors are telling you [lah] so ya
yes yes #ubi#
because I know some of my <malay>kawan</malay> they took the license motorbike licence <malay>kat</malay>
the one <malay>yang kat</malay> the one <malay>yang kat mana</malay> woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there <malay>sunyi</malay> [ah] quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded <malay>macam kat</malay> #ubi# so I think for them was <malay>macam lagi senang</malay> to pass the test [lah] test
[oh] you
you <malay>naik basikal</malay> to #ubi#
[oh] you <malay>tak ambil</malay> public transport
[orh] okay okay okay then for you <malay>kalau dari</malay> #hougang# want to cycle to woodlands <malay>itu dah penat</malay> bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already <malay>penat</malay> you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you <malay>kena</malay> scolding from all instructors
<malay>tapi</malay> I think one practical how much is it now
<malay>dua puluh</malay> [eh] <malay>dua puluh lebih</malay>
[oh] yes yes as you I think as you <malay>naik naik</malay> (uh) as you progress the cost of course [lah] <malay>dah lagi</malay> more <malay>mahal</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's <malay>lagi</malay> more <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] as you go along this
course
but when do you think you will get your license though <malay>boleh beli</malay> motorbike <malay>boleh naik</malay> motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
<malay>lagi</malay> that day <malay>yang kat</malay> [ah] news north west line the major [ah] blackout !alamak! <malay>itu dia orang</malay> during <malay>bila</malay> peak period and then the red line the green line <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> yellow line <malay>sekali</malay> breakdown
ya but [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> when you when you [dah] pass [eh] which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero <malay>itu</malay> [kan] the tuning training centre <malay>punya</malay> motorbike [eh] <malay>tak</malay>
[oh] you can get cause I know my friends <malay>yang sekarang tengah pakai</malay> they say it's (err) fuel efficient <malay>dapat jimat duit sikit</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>atau kalau</malay> you <malay>banyak duit sangat</malay> [kan] you <malay>boleh beli</malay> those (err) more expensive motorbike <malay>yang macam</malay> triumph
is it pronounced triumph T R I U M P H I think so [lah] I'm not too sure myself
triumph or [ah] the one I <malay>paling suka</malay> when I see people riding on the motorbike (uh) royal enfield
[oh] but you don't want to buy a first hand <malay>punya</malay> motorbike [eh]
!wah! and then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tak ada</malay> here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it (err) sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports <malay>sekarang tak boleh</malay> reliable <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I would say that the transport has he has been getting better [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> I think a few years back three or four years back <malay>ada</malay> this one period of time macam</malay> every week confirm plus chop <malay>ada</malay> breakdown every week confirm <malay>ada</malay>
waiting time either too long [lah] or the
breakdown [lah] <malay>ada yang</malay>
(err) the
the travelling time was too long <malay>ada</malay> [jer] problem <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> but I would say now is much better [lah] they're doing a much better job but but having said that <malay>masih boleh</malay> improve that they can still improve so that's my take
[oh] ya true true fair enough you wanted to ask me one question right just now
[oh] like what was the best surprise [lah] I've ever received yes [ah] okay okay
the best surprise [eh] <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>paling dapat</malay> (uh)
<malay>ini</malay> many years ago [lah] [eh] many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday <malay>selamat hari jadi</malay> [eh] my twenty first birthday [ah] my <malay>kawan-kawan kaki bola</malay> my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time <malay>masih masih bulan ramadan</malay> that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month [lah]
so they told me one of my teammate told me to
told me that they will be bringing me out for a birthday dinner
then (err) they chose this place <malay>namanya</malay> is called mark's place the one at #eunos# they wanted to <malay>belanja</malay> me dinner then okay I was like okay sure [ah] then I went down
they book the table for seven so <malay>senang</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> time <malay>buka</malay> we all <malay>boleh makan</malay> together right
so I came down I was so excited [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [eh] I went there at about <malay>pukul berapa</malay> [eh] I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I <malay>duduk</malay> I <malay>duduk</malay> there at the table
then I <malay>duduk</malay> I <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu</malay> for my friends nobody turn up <malay>tak ada orang datang</malay>
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know <malay>ada</malay> because the place where I <malay>tengah duduk</malay> (uh) is facing the road
so I saw this one <malay>kereta</malay> just drive past <malay>tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak</malay> [jer] this <malay>kereta</malay> then I noticed <malay>dia punya</malay> driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
[oh] by the way <malay>kita tak makan kat sini</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> them they <malay>tengok</malay> me and then I still remember other tables
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like <malay>terkejut sikit</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>asal tiba-tiba</malay> want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then (err) so they blindfolded me so when I <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>kereta</malay> I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me <malay>diam-diam</malay> and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location [lah] location <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>sendiri tak tahu</malay> so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the <malay>dia punya pintu</malay>
I can hear the <malay>pintu buka</malay> but when the <malay>pintu buka</malay> also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car [dah] park and then my <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> say okay now you can (uh) get off the car so of course <malay>ada orang pimpin</malay> my <malay>tangan</malay> cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into <malay>longkang</malay> or something
[ah] okay then I just <malay>ikut</malay> I just <malay>pimpin</malay> my friend <malay>tangan</malay> they brought me to a unknown location [ah] next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
<malay>kita kat</malay> marina barrage
ya [oh] if I remember correctly <malay>tak salah</malay> there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) picnic mat they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) fairy lights and they prepared some <malay>makanan</malay> like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were (err) <malay>tengah puasa</malay> time <malay>tengah puasa</malay> I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks <malay>ada bawa</malay> (uh) game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice [lah] like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
<malay>yang paling</malay> best (uh) <malay>lepas kita dah makan dah</malay> sing song (uh) <malay>perut dah kenyang</malay> and then (err) one of them pass me a birthday present
and <malay>nasib</malay> is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a <malay>kasut</malay> nike like this specific <malay>kasut yang</malay>
was quite <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this <malay>kasut</malay> that I think was about <malay>dua ratus lebih</malay> this pair of nike shoes
so (uh) of course I was even more happy [lah] that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that
ya no okay ya I was very happy when I got the present
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will <malay>tanya</malay> the person first like [oh] <malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you want a teddy bear <malay>ke</malay> you want
you want if motorbike cannot [lah] I not that <malay>kaya</malay> so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time <malay>bila aku dalam kereta macam</malay> [eh]
<malay>takkan</malay> they want to kidnap me <malay>takkan</malay> they want to <malay>hantar</malay> me to #johor bahru# or put me in a abandoned house or something <malay>ada</malay> [lah] there was a period of time I was like <malay>asal kereta ni macam</malay> suddenly so quiet [eh] like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my <malay>apa ke tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kawan-kawan kaki bola</malay> so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents [eh]
because sometimes I don't want to <malay>belikan orang tu</malay> a present that they might not want or <malay>atau</malay> present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like [oh] okay what do you want for your birthday [lah] or it's either I buy for them (uh)
vouchers like it can be <malay>macam</malay> adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers [ah] <malay>pergilah kau apa kau nak beli</malay>
I know <malay>kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal</malay> can buy (err) gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually [lah] girls I think <malay>lagi senang</malay> to to buy presents for compared to a guy
anything
but I know one thing at least [ah] my friends my kawan kaki bola yang</malay> celebrated my birthday with me [ah] they actually
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I <malay>tak suka kalau macam</malay>
(uh) big (uh) birthday bash <malay>macam ada orang</malay> [kan] they especially <malay>kalau</malay>
twenty one birthday they will have their <malay>macam nak</malay> glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite <malay>macam kawan dia nenek dia</malay> cousin <malay>dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang</malay> like I <malay>tak suka</malay> that kind of stuff [lah]
I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
<malay>kawan-kawan rapat</malay> [lah] so is good thing that they didn't throw a big (uh) big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like <malay>kalau</malay> anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
that's why that's the thing
and also <malay>kalau macam banyak sangat orang</malay> especially <malay>kalau</malay> invite <malay>banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang</malay> you <malay>tak kenal atau orang yang</malay> that you barely talk to so you <malay>macam tak nak</malay> awkward [lah] then <malay>kalau banyak sangat orang</malay> also later you have to
you have to split your time with (err) different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you <malay>kena</malay> go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having <malay>macam</malay> a very good time and <malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>sendiri</malay>
and I so I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> like you want to have a this <malay>macam</malay> grand gestures right you need to <malay>kena fikir</malay> where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until <malay>macam sakit kepala</malay> [lah] you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance <malay>kalau</malay> you want to do like
<malay>tempat mahal-mahal macam</malay> hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you <malay>kena</malay> book
[ah] <malay>makanan</malay> I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue <malay>nak kena fikir pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>makanan</malay>
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to <malay>fikir</malay> [oh] what entertainment do you want I mean <malay>kalau</malay> you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay [lah] then you can like <malay>lepak</malay> don't have to
think about anything but then again
if you gonna <malay>dapat orang</malay> birthday planner or something like that then you <malay>kena bayar</malay> this birthday planner <malay>pakai duit lagi</malay>
[oh] ya I mean like quite true [eh] <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal</malay> if your birthday on <malay>macam</malay> twenty fifth december <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>macam</malay> your birthday is on (err)
thirty first december where's the peak period <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> confirm <malay>nak nak</malay> book (err) <malay>tempat macam</malay> want to book the hotels <malay>dekat dekat dengan</malay> the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder [lah] I would say or even if your birthday falls (uh) during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and <malay>susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> all this (uh) bookings and stuff
and also <malay>kalau macam</malay> some people <malay>macam tak nak</malay> celebrate <malay>dia punya</malay> birthday <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>nak pergi</malay> overseas <malay>ke apa nak pergi</malay> #batam#
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday <malay>itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu</malay> plane tickets <malay>semua tapi sekarang bila</malay> time <malay>macam gini</malay>
nobody saw it coming <malay>macam</malay> time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] if you can celebrate your birthday in #bali# or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more <malay>gerek</malay> [sia]
like I think for me <malay>kalau</malay> if I can choose [eh] where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that <malay>tempat banyak</malay> sheeps [ah] new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a <malay>tempat</malay> for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside <malay>boleh apa tu</malay> feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
(err) <malay>kambing</malay> so at least when you go places like new zealand especially <malay>dia punya</malay> countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of (uh)
natural activities like <malay>apa tu yang kat</malay> river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
(uh) nice nice mountains and of course <malay>dia punya cuaca</malay> also <malay>lain lain</malay> from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times <malay>dapat juga</malay> some snow you <malay>pernah pergi</malay> new zealand [eh]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> (uh) japan japan <malay>nak cari</malay>
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> and
it was not readily available so you have to do your <malay>macam</malay> homework [lah] before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to <malay>makan</malay> halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food <malay>boleh dapat</malay> at food court you can <malay>dapat</malay> your halal food at a hawker centres which are all <malay>semua dekat dekat boleh jalan</malay> so there the
their are halal food [ah] is different different locations and you have to go and find it in <malay>orang jepun</malay> they don't really speak english so <malay>kalau nak berbual</malay> you probably have to use [ah] the app google translate to help you out
to find your places that you want to go [lah]
[oh] the place I went <malay>mana</malay> [eh] I went to their
(uh) #tokyo# so #tokyo# was #tokyo# honestly <malay>dia macam</malay> singapore [lah] <malay>macam banyak sangat orang</malay> it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of <malay>jepun</malay> that I would like to visit (err) I will go further up north
(err) <malay>pergi</malay> #hokkaido# I think #hokkaido# also <malay>lagi tempat dia</malay> will be more <malay>sejuk</malay> and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to <malay>pernah pergi tak</malay> #hokkaido#
so I think <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't want to go <malay>jepun</malay> another place that I <malay>pernah pergi</malay> also (err) south korea like at least south korea you know [lah] people there <malay>dia punya</malay> complexion <malay>semua cantik-cantik</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> the people there their are complexion all <malay>putih-putih</malay> and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of (err) herbal food <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> is very different from singapore like our singapore diet <malay>kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai</malay> (err) <malay>makanan yang</malay> very oily but there in korea their food
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs
and they always like to eat their favorite #kimchi# so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more <malay>kacak</malay> and <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] actually
[oh] ya because their their location have (err) what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located <malay>dekat</malay> equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure (uh) countries <malay>yang ada</malay> four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to [ah] further up north
places <malay>macam</malay> (err) sweden <malay>ke</malay> or you go to norway or finland if you <malay>tengok</malay> their completion <malay>putih macam letak bedak</malay> kind of putih
so of course I wish I had that kind of a complexion but it's okay no problem
and (err) one thing <malay>kalau</malay> want to talk about (uh) going on vacation and stuff I think one (err) important aspect about going to vacation is to <malay>naik kapal terbang</malay> like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this <malay>kapal terbang</malay> just to <malay>duduk</malay> inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
that feeling of like you are sitting
in a roller coaster when the plane [dah] <malay>nak</malay> takeoff <malay>atau</malay> the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID (err) introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like <malay>macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya</malay> pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the <malay>tempat</malay> economy
so maybe I will decide <malay>nak tengok nak pergi ke tak</malay> but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing [lah] that you can get to travelling during this
(err) COVID situation will you go for this (err) parked (err) <malay>makan</malay>
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong [lah] is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly <malay>kalau nak fikir pasal</malay> six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>ke</malay> or I can use that money for
staycation at resorts world #sentosa#
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december <malay>dah nak dekat</malay>
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher [lah] to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since <malay>orang kat luar</malay> cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
do the spending and we are the ones who will have to
(err) help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that (uh) we will we will be able to come out of this (uh) COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

I don't know it's just me even <malay>elfie cakap</malay> [tau] ya ya !oi! that time <malay>aku tanya dia</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>iya ke jazli</malay> and #izuan# handsome
then <malay>dia kata</malay> [a'ah] not bad why <malay>abeh dia cakap dia orang</malay> handsome <malay>ke</malay> because most girls find find them handsome
<malay>aku macam</malay>
no sorry
yes
for sure [lah] correct correct

#izuan# is like
he came into the picture later exactly
<malay>kau jangan</malay> #wei# <malay>sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang</malay> [sia]
<malay>dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin</malay> [seh]
<malay>izuan kau nak tengok kat izuan izuan ada apa</malay>
<malay>radam gaduh</malay>
maybe ten percent ya
I'm not supposed to tell you
I mean you cannot tell [lah] but
I mean some other way <malay>kau boleh macam</malay>
okay you get the feeling
[oh]
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
if the feelings <malay>hilang</malay> already what
okay if caring okay
his one right I think his type of like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) his kind of
convincing or talk or <malay>apa apa</malay> [ah] in general
his type is to like <malay>macam</malay> lead you on
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
okay <malay>macam</malay> okay
#humairah# said that he still like <malay>macam cakap</malay> to you <malay>cakap</malay>
he talks to #humairah# about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say [oh] I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
[ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope [sia]
(mm)
never ya just dont care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future maybe will
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he <malay>tak itu</malay>
ya exactly
so <malay>jangan</malay> don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
<malay>ada beribu-ribu jantan</malay>
ya [lah]
she got cheated
[oh] my god
like just like that
(mm) cheat <malay>juga</malay> so it's two ways
[oh] my god
[ah] [ah]
she straight up said that
break up
<malay>tak nak tanya</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay
so they are still together
serious [ah]
toxic <malay>bodoh</malay>
<malay>perempuan tu ke lelaki tu</malay>
[oh] <malay>mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu</malay>
(mm)
I mean
you can't K the thing is <malay>kau tak boleh</malay> expect like a guy to look so great
for you
cause that's when you know <malay>macam kau kau</malay> confirm <malay>tak boleh dapat</malay>
<malay>lelaki</malay>
right
you know it's not their <malay>hati yang gatal</malay> it's <malay>bawah dia orang gatal</malay>
ya
[ah] circuit breaker
ya it's very rare to like find guys who are less
you know have that
<malay>susah</malay>
<malay>nak cari pun tak tahu mana nak cari bodoh</malay>
ya
<malay>terus dia</malay> reject
<malay>kau</malay> reject [eh]
[oh] ya <malay>kau tolak</malay> [eh] <malay>kau cakap</malay> I I'm still moving on
high hopes [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>guna gunakan</malay>
[oh] ya
why
[oh] okay now I get it because
okay [lah] now getting because I think he say because split I do number isn't [ah] linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite [lor]
I think he said because <malay>kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua</malay> [kan] zack is the opposite [what] that's why he feels like very competitive <malay>gitu dia tak suka</malay>
!alah! <malay>kesiannya</malay> you but did you tell him that
but did you tell him that
<malay>kau cakap apa dalam</malay> letter <malay>tu</malay>
!alah!
<malay>comelnya</malay> okay
[ah]
(mm)
so cute
but like if a guy if you know that he feels like that right
you should just tell him that <malay>kau orang</malay> together not because your expectation of a guy is
<malay>macam</malay> you should say that at least he tried it's easier
[oh] <malay>dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat</malay>
now what time
okay I mean <malay>dia tak teruk seteruk aku</malay> [tau] but
but what can he do so
(mm)
it's okay
<malay>kawan pun boleh</malay> eventually turn out to be so
it's okay
that's that is the beauty of like having friends [lah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
<malay>selenge aku ketuk kau</malay> [kan] <malay>kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si</malay> zack <malay>depan-depan dia</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku</malay> I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at #izuan's# reaction
ya <malay>tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit</malay> <malay>padan muka</malay>
ya [lah] okay you're you're moving on two months <malay>dia dah</malay> break up <malay>dengan kau</malay> two months
<malay>abeh kau cepat gitu</malay>
okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing but

<malay>sekali yang kat belakang tu tertinggal</malay> then got other people then them [ah] <malay>lepas tu aku dengan humairah tengah cakap cakap</malay> [ah] I I wasn't talking I was on my handphone
then after that she asked me like have you had a boyfriend before
then <malay>aku cakap</malay> (err) not really just <malay>cakap cakap</malay> [jer]
because I got the dating app also then after that (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> I asked her back [lah] you have boyfriend before
<malay>dia kata</malay> if I'm not wrong <malay>dia cakap</malay> (err)
that guy the guy <malay>yang kerja dengan dia kat</malay> <malay>tu</malay>
that was like somewhat close to
(uh) dating [ah]
then he told me
yes she told me she told me about his <malay>macam apa cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia dulu budak madrasah</malay> and stuff like that
then after that (err) <malay>dan mak dia tak suka humairah</malay>
ya and then after that I was like I was so shocked [lah] like <malay>mak dia tak suka</malay>
ya then like the reason was also so stupid
like the girl <malay>dia punya</malay> ex <malay>gaduh dengan gaduh</malay> ya I'm like
ya exactly it's not her [what] <malay>humairah madrasah ke takkan alim</malay> [jer]

I mean isn't that
<malay>budak madrasah ada yang buat yang lagi teruk dari kita</malay>
<malay>ada yang dah</malay>
she told me that you know #umirah#
she said she knows that some
you know that a guy from <malay>madrasah</malay>
<malay>sekolah madrasah</malay>
the guy bought
<malay>suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu</malay> then I'm like
[kan]
can you imagine if I tell #izuan# that
I say that
<malay>aku ni pakai gini tapi aku tak buat benda gitu</malay>
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
but but look like at the kids <malay>yang dah pernah madrasah</malay> even if I don't know they have done it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
K but very annoyed <malay>itu cerita lain ke</malay>
I literally gave up you know when he said that <malay>aku macam tak nak gaduh</malay> [lah] <malay>diam</malay> [jer] [lah]
he said what layer layer layer <malay>aku cakap</malay> am I not layering that one
[kan]
ya [sia]
[oh] #huzni# texted you while we were talking that one
feel uncomfortable [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
okay it's not it's not bad that he <malay>tegur</malay> but <malay>tegur tu</malay> like
<malay>cakap baik-baik</malay> not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he <malay>macam cakap</malay> can you not wear like that <malay>macam gitu</malay>
I'm just saying ya
ya
<malay>nanti lelaki</malay> will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the <malay>macam</malay> I'm the one wrong
<malay>tu pasal aku dah macam marah</malay> that's why I was pissed
ya you I look at you then after that I was like thinking
what the hell
ya the one he said when you were what what made him talk about it [ah]
[ah]
I mean it's your opinion on what you wear [what]
<malay>aku dah cakap apa terang-terang</malay> like <malay>kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu</malay> then it's not my problem
<malay>aku pun</malay> pissed <malay>gila</malay> #wei# <malay>gitu dengar</malay>
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
[eh] you !wah! shit [sia] cannot [sia] like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked #husni# you know
<malay>aku tanya husni gambar-gambar tu</malay>
like it's way before
<malay>aku tanya husni</malay>
I don't know we were talking about [oh] no <malay>kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik</malay>
<malay>lepas tu aku tanya dia</malay> like #husni# was like talking because <malay>kita tiga</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>dah biasa</malay>
then after that we just talk [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) we need to talk about like <malay>macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia</malay> emo <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu aku bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang macam apa jadi</malay>
like as in <malay>apa jadi</malay> as in like (uh) why is she still feeling sad [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay> in my opinion I think
<malay>dia masih belum</malay> move on <malay>gitu</malay> ya then after that ya
(mm) and then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>husni cakap</malay> maybe
(err) <malay>husni</malay> came to a conclusion he just said that (um)
because like (uh) that is why you shouldn't play dating app <malay>ni semua</malay>
ya then after that <malay>aku macam</malay> it's like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
for fun also [what] <malay>kau nak kenal-kenal orang</malay> [jer] [pe]
and then (err) suddenly you say
then he
tell me that (uh) <malay>takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga</malay> [tau] <malay>lelaki ni semua tak bagus</malay>
okay that one was okay I understand he say that
that is nice if he said that
then after that <malay>aku cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like (uh) the guy I talking to that #irfan#
ya I told you ya it's yesterday
I told him that about that guy [ah] <malay>macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu</malay>
then after that I obviously I (um)
(err)
<malay>siapa tu</malay>
<malay>husni cakap</malay> ya just (um) next time just be careful [jer] [lah]
then after that because that #irfan# guy right he commented he
he talked to me about my picture
the one that I put
ya
then <malay>kata aku cakap</malay> (um)
<malay>dia cakap</malay>
<malay>aku bilang husni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tanya dia</malay> in my in your opinion [lah] do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
<malay>pasal tu husni cakap</malay> no you cannot see anything [what]
because it's all black you cannot see the shape
it's just one line <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer]
[oh] so so like what's the problem it's just one line
if you
if guys also do that we can see [what] if I ask #husni# to do #husni# also have [what]
(mmhmm)
!wah! it'll it will trigger me right if he say that <malay>dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini</malay>
<malay>tak tak tak</malay>

<malay>abeh</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah]
ya
it's true [ah]
it makes sense [ah] cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere [tau]
like which not written anywhere where <malay>kau ada cakap</malay> what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like <malay>macam kat</malay> france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing [kan]
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic [kan] but at the same time french people are much more open
like <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku tak boleh tidur</malay> [ah] like
<malay>aku tengok</malay> Twitter and like romanticism [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> !wah! annoying <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
like <malay>macam kau</malay> expect <malay>benda-benda merepek</malay> [tau] everything
like <malay>macam benda-benda macam merepek</malay> (oo) sweet <malay>nya</malay> sweet <malay>nya terus macam apa yang kau</malay> sweet <malay>sangat</malay> #siak#
like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] handphone <malay>tengah</malay> record <malay>kalau tak aku dah buka</malay> Twitter <malay>aku dah tunjuk</malay> all the things that
(uh huh)
[oh] that <malay>ada</malay> this girl [ah] there's this girl who <malay>ni mata air aku bilang</malay> there's this girl <malay>dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>ada</malay> #angkong# <malay>semua</malay>
like <malay>macam tu</malay> so sweet <malay>macam</malay> she accepted him <malay>macam</malay> okay then after that like <malay>macam orang dia kata orang kat</malay> Twitter <malay>cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>terus macam</malay> (err) okay
ya
ya then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
then the boyfriend keep on kissing <malay>dia punya</malay> cheeks kind of thing then <malay>macam</malay> (err) then recently [ah] the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
(um) singaporean <malay>bi</malay> I don't need sex [ah] I can wait I can live without sex
<malay>terus aku nak kata</malay> [lah] if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else [lah]
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa yang macam merepek</malay> [ah] like that's the thing [tau] <malay>macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal</malay> romanticism [kan]
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
<malay>ikut perasaan</malay> [tau] <malay>perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut</malay> just to like <malay>macam</malay>
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us [tau]
like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] I don't know how to explain [ah] <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> Twitter [ah] then after that <malay>aku</malay> can
really [ah] <malay>aku tunjuk aku</malay> can actually come to senses [ah] like <malay>tunjuk kau macam aku ambil</malay>
<malay>kita punya kedai</malay> handphone <malay>ada</malay> Twitter
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
<malay>takde</malay> Twitter [ah]
okay [lah]
<malay>camne</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> explain
(oo) best [ah] <malay>kau kena tengok</malay> [ah] eileen the burton
eileen the burton [ah] [eh] for example [ah] the things <malay>yang dia</malay> highlight
[a'ah]
<malay>yang benda yang dia</malay> highlight is like especially <malay>macam perempuan</malay> do this <malay>padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat</malay> like <malay>macam kita padahal kita buat</malay> not only with <malay>kita</malay> partners <malay>dengan</malay> members <malay>pun sama</malay> [tau] like <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku satu minggu penat macam</malay> for example #dan# it can be as simple as #dan#
this week <malay>aku penat gila</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak boleh turun boleh</malay> that kind of thing [tau] but we expect him to understand that [eh] <malay>kau dah bodoh</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini</malay> [ah] that kind of thing [ah] it's like it's as easy as bro (uh) this week I quite full [lah] cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
[ah] this kind of thing [ah] so <malay>dia kata</malay> if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense [ah]
<malay>abeh dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> we expect to do that we expect
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>dia cerita</malay> [kan] [ah] from a real life <malay>punya</malay> experiences <malay>dia balik</malay>
one week of work
<malay>dia balik</malay> then after that (err) <malay>anak dia anak dia</malay> baby <malay>dia</malay> give <malay>anak dia</malay> some food <malay>anak dia tepis</malay> toddler [ah] <malay>nangis terus</malay>
<malay>kalau bini dia dah sepak</malay> [ah] I mean <malay>dia kata aku dah bingit gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan bini aku</malay> but he's my son [lah] but what I did was I try to understand him
like <malay>macam</malay> why did he why did he behave this way <malay>dia nak berak ke</malay> pampers <malay>dia ini ke dia gigi nak</malay> grow <malay>ke gini gini</malay> [ah] that's why then after that that was thinking [ah] <malay>dia kata dia macam</malay> why can't I behave
like that towards my wife as well that kind of thing [lah] cause
[ah] like <malay>macam senang cakap bila kalau</malay>
<malay>benda gini</malay> we always talk about girls [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing [ah] like but at the end of the day also most guys also <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> how to talk about
emotions <malay>macam suami</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if they feel something <malay>diam</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> #dan# <malay>pun diam</malay> unless <malay>kita</malay> brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
this kind of thing [ah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
ya
[ah]
ya
(mm)
[a'ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak ada orang ajar</malay> I mean like they
in a way <malay>lelaki</malay> [kan]
there's no
they are left on their own [ah]
that's why <malay>dorang macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak kesah pasal</malay> for example <malay>kalau laki laki</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa-siapa nak keluar</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita punya anak sedara ke siapa</malay> [pe] <malay>bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar</malay> take care [eh] <malay>jangan</malay> naughty naughty [eh] <malay>perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong</malay> that kind of thing [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>laki</malay> we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there [ah] quite expected to know everything or like <malay>kau</malay> should know find for the answers
but
<malay>kita</malay> is still need a manual [pe] in some ways <malay>cuma</malay> that differentiate people [lah] like how they actually view things [ah] like some people they will <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost <malay>sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih</malay> lost <malay>ada kalau</malay> people have gone through a lot of shit [kan] then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] things cannot happen like this [ah] I want to find something better <malay>baru dorang</malay> improve

!hais! [sial] <malay>laki ni</malay> [ha] <malay>padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni</malay> [sial] I mean like [oh] okay so you have to lie now
[ah]
that's why
#dan# [ah] <malay>macam dulu</malay> #dan# <malay>macam</malay> [oh] thanks bro <malay>macam</malay> !whoa! best [pe] #dan# <malay>ada dekat sini</malay>
<malay>sekarang apa-apa</malay> #dan# <malay>buat nanti</malay> #syahmi# will find a reason to hate on it
just simple as that [ah]
<malay>pada aku ni macam</malay> a little bit romanticism in a way
[ah] this is also one [ah] shopping for a guy is so hard what do you guys like beside other girls' pictures
I mean like <malay>macam</malay>
to to a certain extent okay [lah] there are some guys who just like openly like <malay>ni semua macam</malay> that's the thing like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku tahu</malay> [sia] <malay>macam</malay> from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys [sial] [lah] living okay <malay>tak payah pergi jauh</malay> #adam# <malay>sendiri</malay> #siak# <malay>berapa banyak</malay> attached women go to him
talk to him and want something from him
<malay>dia macam</malay>
the fuck is that <malay>abeh kau nak</malay> come to <malay>aku</malay> like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> pure <malay>gila nak mampus</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> no I only think of you <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [ah] <malay>kita manusia</malay> [ah] [sial]
[a'ah]
that's the thing okay about romanticism [kan] okay there's
<malay>dia kata</malay> one of the things that
is quite
toxic [ah] is when you
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so <malay>dia kata apa</malay> [tau]
when you <malay>kira</malay>
that's why there's this research [ah] woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
and then (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err)
so they intertwine sex <malay>dengan</malay> love so if someone can treat you like good
<malay>bagus gila nak mampus</malay> [tau]
sweet <malay>tapi dia tak boleh</malay> fuck you well [ah]
<malay>kau terus</malay> down
<malay>kau macam</malay> [oh] this is not true love
or in a way [ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> how I see it [ah] like most girls [kan] <malay>bila dia dah</malay> give themselves too easy to a guy
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>yang apa nama dia ini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> try to understand [tau]
<malay>kadang mata air aku ada sikit</malay> annoying [ah] which is <malay>aku</malay> understand <malay>pada aku</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> believe in romanticism [ah]
before <malay>dia</malay> know <malay>aku</malay> [pe] so like (err)
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and like <malay>macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah</malay> end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that <malay>aku nak main orang lain</malay> or what [ah]
but it's just that when you place that [kan] so slowly <malay>kau</malay> subconsciously
<malay>kau punya</malay> mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
(err) <malay>kalau apa nama dia</malay> that mind <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>kalau kau</malay> like <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan] sexually <malay>dah kira salah kalau kau</malay> have fun <malay>kalau</malay> that time <malay>dia ada</malay> issue with <malay>aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila</malay>
<malay>terus dia tengok</malay> story <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you look you seem more happier with her <malay>tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku</malay> happy <malay>pun salah ke</malay>
that kind of thing like <malay>macam</malay> so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
more than me
<malay>maknanya</malay> that person is for him then <malay>macam</malay> happiness comes in different form
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want [ah]
so <malay>kau jangan</malay> think it the way just cause <malay>gini abeh kau</malay> down
<malay>abeh</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia dah tak suka aku</malay> like this
overthinking [ah] [ah] but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this [ah]
one she's alone overseas
<malay>takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua</malay> that's what overthinking is a more commonly (err)
ya happen in that situation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> all these toxic <malay>punya</malay>
toxic <malay>punya pemikiran</malay> [ah]
and like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pada aku</malay> most of the time <malay>kita tak gaduh</malay> it's just that disagreement [jer] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> we talk about something disagree <malay>macam</malay> #dan# <malay>dengan ni</malay>
[ah] #dan# <malay>dengan</malay> #mel#
<malay>tapi tak sampai kita merajuk</malay> it's just that <malay>aku</malay> disagree <malay>atau</malay> certain things like <malay>macam dia kata</malay> I cannot sleep [ah] <malay>terus macam asal</malay> [oh] I
don't overthink <malay>kau bilang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>asal</malay> let me talk to you [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
ease your mind <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau</malay>
<malay>abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang</malay> then after that <malay>dia</malay> come to conclusion that <malay>dia</malay> overthinking <malay>abeh dia ingat macam</malay>
[oh] <malay>aku selalu buat orang susah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh</malay>
<malay>ini bukan gaduh</malay> it's just us communicating [jer]
can you stop <malay>pasal</malay> that's the thing
<malay>macam</malay> all these romanticism [kan] <malay>benda-benda gini fikir gaduh</malay>
romanticism
<malay>pada dia</malay> [kan] love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun
<malay>gaduh ni semua takkan berlaku</malay>
that is like the the extreme (err) <malay>apa</malay> view of romanticism [ah] we have three more minutes my friend
<malay>dah terlalu banyak benda</malay> personal if you're listening to this
and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
<malay>tadi korang cakap berbual pasal</malay> happiness <malay>pun macam</malay>
happiness is happiness by itself [ah]
cause you don't compare yours with another people ya
it's just like <malay>macam</malay> how <malay>orang</malay> europe confirm <malay>pergi</malay> holiday <malay>dekat</malay> #bali#
<malay>dia kata</malay> !ee!

I see
ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the

I don't know I used to I mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right #suria# so when they have the on <malay>kadang-kadang kalau ada</malay> show <malay>yang macam</malay> okay okay then I'll sit and watch [ah] but to be honest I cannot remember any any specific title
ya so it's like (err) I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
[ah] ya like it's just like <malay>macam</malay> background noise <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay> I I mean the content okay <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like the some documentaries there was one with (um) that girl #dalila# I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ya that one was quite interesting
[ah] #dalina# #dalina# during <malay>bulan puasa</malay> [ah] <malay>bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>sebelum buka</malay> then <malay>baru</malay> will watch
<malay>kalau tak macam</malay> (err)
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to [oh] okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says [ah] which is very true everything is on demand
[ah]
[oh] my goodness
[oh] my goodness <malay>mentang-mentang ada</malay> library [eh] <malay>kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki</malay> [eh] ya
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya

<malay>anjing</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>cantik</malay>
<malay>cantik</malay> [seh] babe is that #ros# in the photo
[oh] ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
okay
ya
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] <malay>kau mengarut</malay>
<malay>aku</malay>
pessimistic as in about your relationship
(uh huh) (uh huh)
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
[oh] okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
[oh] okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about <malay>kalau</malay> you [dah] age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house [what]
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more [lah] cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying [oh] I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married [meh] no need to buy <malay>ke</malay> you know ya then still spend money [what]
ya
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] no then <malay>sekarang</malay> are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
<malay>aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau</malay> robert <malay>kalau</malay> !alah! <malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>sebab kau rasa macam</malay> robert you know would have the financial means
I don't know but #ros# also
but the think is russell financial means are also above average <malay>jadi</malay> you know <malay>apa yang tak cukup ni</malay> sorry <malay>kau</malay>
[oh] like you yourself okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
is it <malay>dia</malay>
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole [lah] also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
right but then cause of COVID and then they say [oh] people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya [lah] <malay>rasa takut tu mesti ada</malay> right <malay>sikit</malay>
!huh!
[a'ah]
ya
what [oh] no but [eh] five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya [lah] there's your savings
[oh] okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount <malay>berapa</malay>
[eh] thirty three <malay>dengan</malay> hundred <malay>jauh beza</malay> [seh]
dope okay [lah] hundred plus
okay [eh] then okay [eh] not so bad [eh] hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan [ah] is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus [lah]
!wah! that is okay [lah] <malay>tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat</malay> collect then
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
ya two percent then <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] just pay [lah] five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest [what] cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it [lah]
<malay>tahu tahu</malay>
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from [kan]
[ah] okay okay can [lah]
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
[oh] no
(mm)
(mm) (mm)

and my sister-in-law and #hanan#
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited [seh] they want to go out with #hanan#
<malay>takkan</malay> I want to cancel right everything just cause we had a fight then #hanan# also want to go out
ya [lah] <malay>tapi tapi tak</malay> awkward [lah] hide the truth
!hais!
he's like <malay>hati berangin</malay> [lah]
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see [lah] #inshaallah# [lah] and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee [lah] like (um) you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me [lah] they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
but haven't found like my <malay>tudung</malay> style you know it's stressful cause you have to iron
ya
[ah]
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
that's all ya and okay I I think in in the first place also <malay>dia macam malas</malay> [ah] <malay>nak keluar pun</malay>
<malay>sebab dia baru balik kerja</malay> [kan] the night before
ya I also think so and then and then he just <malay>melenting</malay> you know
ya cause like <malay>dia terus nak cari</malay> excuse [ah] then he can just say he don't want to go right
his family I mean his sister asked me [lah] I told his sister [lah] the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
he's a bit <malay>panas</malay>
ya
like he got his temper
[ah] ya I told I told his sister ya
then his mother like then he <malay>tipu</malay> just say !haiya! <malay>dia tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dia penat dia malas</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia malas nak keluar</malay>
ya
!hais!
ya [lah] this is
[eh] you know that used to be me but now I'm like !haiya! I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
<malay>macam</malay>
I'm like I used to be so feisty like I used to be okay no it has to be this way this way I want it my way <malay>sekarang</malay> like !haiya! whatever [lah] I cannot be bothered as long as everybody alive at the end of the day <malay>aku tak kisah</malay>
<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
he's okay if cause for #hanan# right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually #hanan# is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work [what]
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also [lah] but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like #hidayat# will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
like one hour <malay>gitu hidayat</malay> will actually wake up early to play with him
cause <malay>hanan subuh dah bangun</malay>
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
<malay>dia macam faham dia tengok upin</malay> and <malay>ipin</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia ketawa</malay>
ya [lah] but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
I just scared he feels like [eh] <malay>mak aku tak sayang aku</malay> [eh] <malay>asyik-asyik nak tinggalkan aku kat tempat merata-rata dunia</malay>
<malay>bukannya dia kerja pun dia duduk rumah pun dia tinggalkan aku kat rumah nenek aku</malay> [lah] <malay>opah aku</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian aku budak kecil</malay> I mean if he's thinking that way but ya mum's guilt
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
ya so I will be boiling it for five hours <malay>entahlah macam mana</malay> it will turn out
but like plain
no salt no what
<malay>belum</malay> [ah]
ya he <malay>pernah</malay> start <malay>aku kasih dia makan</malay>
now (um) next week [ah]
next week <malay>dia boleh makan bubur dah</malay>
like <malay>dia dah</malay> six months plus
so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
ya
ya hopefully
<malay>dah besar dah boleh duduk dah esok dia pergi dah</malay>
but #hidayat# and me are like no [lah] I think I think #hanan# will be the one and only cause <malay>penat</malay> [sia] <malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> I don't know [ah] it's just so so tiring like where do people get the energy from you know
maybe
!huh! I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
<malay>aku dah tiga puluh tahun pun mak aku</malay> still come in to to help me so much
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
!hais!
ya until we die until you die or they die first whoever dies first you know <malay>khalas</malay> we're done
ya [lah] even now also my mother helping me out so much if you need anything for #hanan# anything anything for her <malay>cucu</malay>
ya

I feel like they always <malay>sindir</malay> <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kita tak pakai bahasa kesat kita kita kita kita apa</malay> [eh]
I don't know [ah] what they say but they always say like they they are not <malay>kesat</malay> when they are disrespectful blah blah blah then that's your brand [lah] no need to say other people [what]
you know and then they they are like two guys and then they are not really like guys you know the #zuhairi# right he's a bit soft so he's like <malay>nyah aku rasa aku tak akan bayar hantaran</malay> and all these things
you know then then the other guy will be like [oh] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>itu pasal kita orang tak kahwin</malay> you know
<malay>apa apa</malay> [lah] they are so they are so <malay>lokek</malay> they come across as so <malay>lokek</malay>
ya no don't don't even bother I tried giving them a chance it just makes my blood boil
ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with #aisyah# his girlfriend #aisyah aziz#
it was okay [lah] but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like [oh] you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows [what] his girlfriend is #aisyah aziz#

people like #razz# will
[a'ah]
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually #dzar# can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no [lah]
#din# doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that [oh] okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least #dzar# has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya

!wow!
I know how to self-defence like <malay>siapa-siapa nak pegang</malay> [kan] try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys [lah] cause <malay>dah banyak kali kita dah</malay> take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger [lah] <malay>belajar belajar belajar belajar</malay> #pang# <malay>satu kali ni</malay> this guy [ah] <malay>dia nak</malay> try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one <malay>yang nak ambil</malay> advantage <malay>punya</malay> he he tried to <malay>macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua</malay> then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can [lah] can [lah] <malay>terus</malay> I give up like okay <malay>kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa</malay> I give him one punch at his face because I was
because I was like damn pissed off [lah] cause he really thinks I'm like girls is just like so weak you know like I hate it because
that [one] I don't care [lah] like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me <malay>ke buang</malay> (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and <malay>dia pangkat</malay> sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant <malay>punya</malay> rank [lah] so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did <malay>buang</malay> so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege I mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
I can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens happens [lah] because I know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like I can just be brave that's what I can do I just ya put my mind into him
like because like I feel like I'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
I don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like <malay>bukan macam</malay> [eh] <malay>lu macam muak</malay> no
that's exactly ya that is like <malay>ya allah tolong</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>buat macam gini</malay> you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows <malay>macam</malay> because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>berbual maki ya allah</malay> you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those <malay>hijab</malay> people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear <malay>hijab</malay> and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant #blah# #blah# #blah# no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
like all those wannabes
same <malay>sama</malay> ya true true
(mmhmm) like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect <malay>memang betul kita semua bukan</malay> perfect <malay>pun</malay>
so is like something is even <malay>orang yang</malay> very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes <malay>kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam</malay> [oh] !wow! <malay>kita aku rasa aku betul</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi orang lain tengok macam</malay> [eh] actually <malay>dia ni apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia buat</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>salah</malay> [sia] <malay>padahal sendiri fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>baik baik baik</malay>
<malay>tapi nanti bila dah</malay> live a long life already <malay>fikir balik macam</malay> like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that [lah] like so <malay>sekarang</malay> for the <malay>mak</malay> and <malay>minah</malay> I feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe <malay>tak dia kurang ajar</malay>
<malay>pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar</malay> so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a <malay>minah</malay> and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a <malay>minah</malay>
I can be any anyone [lah] like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
I can be a <malay>minah</malay> I can be a #mat# I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to <malay>macam</malay> you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes <malay>kita tak macam</malay> we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but <malay>padahal macam pada kita</malay> is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to <malay>macam</malay> sugarcoat everything <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai hijab tak tutup</malay> (err) <malay>apa apa ni leher takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>lupa melayu sikit takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tak tutup pun takpe</malay> [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai tudung dengan</malay> sleeveless <malay>pun tak apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau nak main bola pakai tudung</malay>
never heard of that but ya like <malay>semalam dah cakap</malay> [ah] it's like okay that kind of <malay>teguran</malay> is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but <malay>padahal</malay> #farah# itself is like
like I don't really mean that you know like I I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously I feel so <malay>malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri</malay>
(mmhmm) I mean they have like that self esteem okay fine that [one] I but then like that's too much [lah] know your limits [lah] no need to rub to our faces [lah] at least (mmhmm)
[eh] [oh] my god <malay>kalau tak jadi riak pun</malay> #allah# <malay>tak terima</malay> [sia] so #allah# <malay>sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat</malay> so the more you share to people <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak aku solat</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>lima waktu</malay> [sia]
okay then what you want me to do <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you confirm go to heaven [lah] what you expect exactly so is like [oh] my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite <malay>quran</malay> [ah] a lot of time <malay>macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau <malay>dah</malay> khatam belum</malay> like <malay>aku dah khatam</malay> [sia]
I'm like okay you can at least say like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kalau</malay> if your friends like haven't <malay>khatam</malay> and you have already <malay>khatam</malay> like at least two times three times you can just <malay>ajar</malay> that person <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku tolong kau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku bimbing</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku akan jadi</malay> your guide [lah]
guidance okay so <malay>kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam</malay> K [lah] <malay>aku jadi cikgu engkau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku dah khatam banyak kali</malay> like you don't have to say that <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
like for example I haven't <malay>khatam</malay> you already <malay>khatam</malay> then I'm like I really want to <malay>khatam</malay> because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of (um) like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then #farah# came up to me like example [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) do you need help like <malay>kau belum khatam</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab aku baru khatam</malay> so <malay>kau perlukan bantuan tak</malay> at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay [ah] <malay>boleh tolong tak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like [oh] my god like <malay>memalukan gila</malay> [lah] <malay>serius serius</malay> like <malay>tuduh ke</malay>
[oh] my yes yes yes

so <malay>daripada situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni</malay>
<malay>macam dulu tak boleh dengar pun sebenarnya bila orang</malay>

[eh] that actually happen to me <malay>bila</malay> poly (uh) <malay>apa ni bila</malay> during internship whereby <malay>aku punya</malay> internship [kan] <malay>aku</malay> design web design <malay>dengan</malay> digital pin
<malay>abeh</malay> time <malay>tu aku punya</malay> task <malay>untuk buat</malay> it was already <malay>aku punya</malay> internship was just three months long <malay>sebab kita punya</malay> <malay>panjang abeh</malay>
during <malay>aku</malay> [eh] three to four months internship so during <malay>macam</malay> like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so <malay>aku nak kena</malay> design <malay>macam dorang punya apa ni</malay> interactive <malay>punya benda</malay> and it's not even a topic that is being touched on <malay>dekat</malay> poly <malay>tak ada</malay> [pun] imagine <malay>kau kena buat</malay> <malay>punya benda</malay>
<malay>kira macam</malay> code <malay>tapi untuk</malay> <malay>punya</malay> system <malay>orang letak</malay> I pad <malay>dorang boleh</malay> scan <malay>abeh kita orang nak kena</malay> design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building <malay>pasal</malay> museum <malay>dia ada</malay> four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor <malay>datang dorang boleh</malay> scan <malay>benda tu</malay> initially <malay>aku kena buat sorang-sorang</malay>
then <malay>kau</malay> internship <malay>sama-sama dengan kawan</malay> [lah] ask your friend to internship like <malay>sama-sama</malay> company like apply together
<malay>mana tahu</malay> like <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> [kan] my company <malay>tiga orang</malay> apply three people apply me and <malay>apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang</malay> end up <malay>dengan sama-sama</malay> internship and another <malay>aku punya</malay> close friend but in the end <malay>dorang</malay> reject my close friend <malay>sebab ada dua</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> company <malay>tu</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing <malay>dia ada sebab dia</malay> more vocal than <malay>aku</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> because

I think the year ones and the year three had it difficult this year
<malay>kau ada kawan</malay> year one [kan]
[ah] <malay>lagi</malay> especially <malay>kita madrasah</malay> student [kan] <malay>jadi kita tak pernah</malay> exposed to like <malay>apa ni</malay> people from different races
different <malay>ya ke</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> all this while <malay>korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu</malay> [jer] [pe]
[ah] okay [lah] like during my time is like total culture shock <malay>aku kena joget semua</malay>
!wah! like looking back right <malay>macam haram</malay> [sia] <malay>aku buat semua</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau tak</malay> regret
ya I remember ya you had a <malay>apa ni</malay> project during secondary school I scolded you for like <malay>macam</malay> !huh! <malay>benda macam gini</malay> simple <malay>pun tak boleh buat</malay> ya that is so
<malay>kesian</malay>
pathetic <malay>pun ada</malay>
(um) [oh]
<malay>tak tahu apa nak buat</malay>
actually honestly [kan] like since <malay>aku</malay> first [kan] among <malay>kita punya</malay> siblings [kan] so <malay>macam aku tak ada kakak</malay> or <malay>abang</malay> to ask things from mummy and is like totally <malay>apa ni</malay> <malay>dorang tak tahu apa-apa</malay> and they depend on me <malay>kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik</malay> #shahrul# <malay>macam mana nak anuh ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu bila aku</malay> start <malay>pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku</malay> can imagine last time before <malay>kita ada</malay> internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend <malay>yang pandai</malay> internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> internet computer remember so <malay>aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> email <malay>dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad <malay>tak akan aku nak tunjuk</malay> and you like what kindergarten <malay>lagi</malay> [pe] time <malay>tu</malay> like time <malay>tu</malay> I was
okay <malay>kau baru</malay> primary [kan]
no it was like primary four primary six ya [lah] ya so primary four primary six <malay>yang kita jalan gi apa ni</malay> #bedok# library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> then I say or else mummy <malay>tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi</malay> library so last time <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> research <malay>ke apa pergi</malay> library [ah] <malay>abeh tu</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> #abi# <malay>beli</malay> computer <malay>letak dekat bilik</malay> that's when slowly but then <malay>kita pakai</malay> internet <malay>untuk buat apa tengok</malay> youtube video game
ya so <malay>dulu pun macam</malay> struggle <malay>pun</malay> struggle <malay>sendiri juga</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] yes and that's the <malay>ni apa ni</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> by the time [kan] <malay>boleh nampak beza</malay> [tau] so time <malay>tu aku ingat masa aku</malay> tuition [ah] <malay>aku</malay> tuition <malay>dengan</malay> #kak mon# #kak mon# <malay>sama umur</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma aku</malay> first child <malay>dia</malay> third
third daughter
can't
so <malay>bila kita kat</malay> tuition I never felt the difference between me and #mon# so <malay>aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama</malay> like we learn together we grew up together like we had <malay>silat</malay> and everything like that and like on these last few days of the <malay>kita orang punya</malay> tuition <malay>ni</malay> the <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] #mar# <malay>anak nombor berapa</malay> then I say first then #mun# <malay>berapa</malay> [oh] <malay>patut</malay> [lah] <malay>nampak beza</malay> then I was like !huh! there is a difference <malay>macam dia kata</malay> in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her <malay>macam aku merepek-merepek pun</malay> there is still a difference between
your level of #merepekness# [ah] things like that
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] so last time <malay>aku</malay> struggle [ah] <malay>kau nampak aku macam</malay> I had it all like some (uh) <malay>macam senang</malay> but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> computer <malay>macam mana nak buat ni nak buat</malay> report <malay>macam mana nak buat</malay> homework okay of course I had tuitions [lah] back then but
I had tuition is about mummy and #abi# cannot help us
[ah] yes
<malay>memang kau tak tahu aku susah ke tak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> laptop
I deserve that first hand items !hey!
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu hidup</malay>
and <malay>tak macam dulu</malay>
<malay>macam kau sekarang</malay> by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would <malay>macam</malay> !huh! <malay>benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu</malay>
but then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau</malay> and last time it was not as <malay>apa ni</malay> is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation [tau] so <malay>macam memang kena belajar</malay> and last time I honestly I was one of the <malay>macam lembab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year <malay>aku buat</malay> friendster
<malay>dah tak</malay> popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook [oh] I think it was facebook facebook <malay>atau</malay> messenger it was the messenger <malay>yang</malay> popular
<malay>kau tak tahu</malay> messenger <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia macam</malay> chatting <malay>punya benda</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay> I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail <malay>ke</malay> microsoft so <malay>tapi</malay> by then <malay>aku dah ada</malay> messenger <malay>terus</malay> facebook <malay>dah</malay> popular so <malay>macam bila orang berbual pasal</malay> friendster <malay>aku macam</malay> (hmm) [oh] I also had friendster [oh] <malay>nama apa</malay> then I was like
(um) I don't remember my handle at all
ya those were the days [lah]
but I would love to go back to those days
less stressful than now
ya
if you okay <malay>kalau</malay> #aisha# <malay>ada</malay> time okay [lah] I know #aisha# <malay>baru masuk</malay> poly life [kan] like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one <malay>macam pada kau paling</malay> memorable <malay>sekali</malay>
why
last few years you mean
<malay>rabak</malay> in what sense
have to live up to the name of the monitress
but you are the monitress you have to be the responsible one [oh] so instead of monitor monitress other students is like monitress monitor
then why was he the monitor
<malay>tak ada satu pun jadi</malay> monitor <malay>ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi</malay> [lah]
(um) [oh] class voting
since but <malay>bila</malay> first time <malay>kau jadi</malay> monitress [kan] was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes <malay>aku tahu aku</malay> favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and <malay>abang</malay>
going [oh] [oh]
the thing
<malay>bila ni</malay> which year [oh] my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah lepas pun</malay>
[oh] where you guys go overseas
[ah] class <malay>ni tak payah dengar</malay> [lah]
[oh] because she was the same form teacher [oh] what
malay guy [oh] ya I think I know her okay [oh]
<malay>kat</malay> ear <malay>punya</malay> height [oh]
<malay>tak tinggi mana</malay> shoulder [oh]
polytechnic private
favourite [eh] I think in terms of memories
I would say secondary
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you <malay>pilih</malay> which <malay>madrasah</malay> you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during <malay>kak punya</malay> time
<malay>kita orang tak ada pilihan</malay> unless you choose to change school then <malay>kita</malay> change school <malay>kalau tak</malay> all the way <malay>kita</malay> in the same school [lah]
so time <malay>tu bila dah masuk</malay> secondary [kan] <malay>bila</malay> primary [kan] <malay>kita orang macam</malay>
[ah] less drama more fun
so when it comes to secondary so all this while
[oh] okay I think for me I remember my primary school because the best year was during primary four
whereby madam #rosanna# was our form teacher and she taught us everything <malay>dia ajar</malay>
<malay>dia ajar</malay> [ah] english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday <malay>kita orang akan</malay> mix so someday we just do all english
because she is going to cover everything within all her periods and everything and during that time we have young entrepreneur scheme competition
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class [ah] like thirty five of us work together madam #rosanna# being herself a creative teacher she like do art project <malay>untuk kita orang semua</malay> and that's how we became closer especially during [ah] like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
[ah] during the june holidays <malay>lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat</malay> artworks for example [ah] old vases <malay>kita orang</malay> paint <malay>balik</malay> to sell during our end <malay>kita orang punya tempat yang kita</malay> for the competition was at #tampines# mall you know where <malay>dorang</malay> have the bazaar <malay>sebelah</malay> #tampines# mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar <malay>hari raya</malay>
no even now <malay>yang kalau ada</malay> bazaar <malay>dekat</malay> #tampines#
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate <malay>dia kau tahu yang</malay> vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it <malay>yang</malay> colour colour purple colour blue <malay>macam</malay> vanguard sheet [oh] my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet [ah]
so <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> vanguard sheet <malay>depan belakang</malay> and then <malay>dia jual</malay> envelope <malay>macam untuk</malay> envelope <malay>macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang</malay> fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition <malay>kita orang punya</malay> class <malay>dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>kita orang punya sekolah</malay> we first time <malay>arabia masuk</malay> and <malay>kita orang menang dapat</malay> fourth position
all thanks to madam #rosanna# so but she put the most effort [lah] because we were like only primary four <malay>kita berapa</malay> years old then ten years old we don't <malay>tak tahu banyak benda</malay> [kan] so then after that when <malay>kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu</malay> primary four <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class
I also imagine like primary one primary two primary three and primary four
everyone was in the same class
they just <malay>tak ada</malay>
so last time during my <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> my time right <malay>dorang tak ada macam</malay> [ah] <malay>yang pandai</malay>
<malay>yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those <malay>yang susah juga</malay> [lah]
(uh)
<malay>korang</malay> seven levels [seh] A B C D E F six okay
and also the lower class [lah]
<malay>kesiannya</malay>
[oh] because they want you guys to focus on studies or [ah] but did you look forward to that camp so <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>kesah sangat</malay>
antisocial
okay then
antisocial [lah] <malay>tu</malay> so okay back <malay>tu aku punya cerita</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class [tau] <malay>abeh kita orang punya</malay> class ground level ground level [kan] so <malay>satu</malay> class <malay>satu</malay> class it all happen when mummy [kan] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>jual</malay> [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> so <malay>aku selalu</malay> stay back
so I think there was a <malay>kita orang punya</malay> senior <malay>ke apa tak puas hati dengan</malay> some girl from of course [lah] boy so <malay>dorang macam</malay> unhappy with the between class five A and five B [ah] so boyfriend <malay>kat</malay> five B <malay>suka</malay> girl <malay>kat</malay> five A girl <malay>kat</malay> five A <malay>suka lelaki kat</malay> five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six <malay>tak puas hati</malay>
so what happen was like one of <malay>kita orang punya</malay> time find that I always stay back <malay>pasal</malay> mummy <malay>jualan</malay> [kan] <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku tunggu</malay> [lah] mummy <malay>habis baru balik sama-sama</malay> what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do <malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> a few clique until today <malay>aku masih ingat pasal</malay> that is the same clique
who <malay>koyakkan aku punya</malay> duty roster <malay>bila</malay> secondary one
[ah] [ah] I hold grudge
<malay>kalau dengar</malay> okay so <malay>dorang dah koyakkan</malay> the duty roster and the next day <malay>bila</malay> five B <malay>datang dorang cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>aku yang koyakkan</malay>
<malay>sebab aku yang</malay> stay back
yes and ya ya <malay>pasal aku tak</malay> hold grudge <malay>sangat aku</malay> hold grudge yang secondary one <malay>punya tapi semua dah besar</malay>
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> then after that after that whole incident
<malay>mengamuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] because it was just not me I was with another friend <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan</malay> by the time <malay>akak balik dia pun balik</malay> so all this while <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay> but the other class knowing that <malay>aku yang selalu</malay> stay back <malay>tunggu</malay> mummy
then <malay>dorang ni</malay> [ah]
or maybe <malay>bila aku tak ada dekat</malay> class I didn't stay at the classroom [what] I will just stay at the #musollah# <malay>ataupun dekat luar</malay>
[ah] so what happen afterwards was <malay>kita orang</malay> start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started <malay>dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan</malay> pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school <malay>semua orang kena</malay> stay back <malay>semua dari</malay> five A <malay>semua dari</malay> five B <malay>kena</malay> stay back <malay>aku daripada</malay> five A [kan] <malay>dengar</malay>
<malay>dorang tak tahu tu</malay> primary six <malay>aku tahu pasal siapa lagi</malay> yang stay back <malay>tapi pasal dia</malay> senior <malay>aku tak ada</malay> senior <malay>lagi nak tolong aku</malay> so it happen to the extent that madam #rosanna# form teacher <malay>kita orang bila</malay> primary four gather <malay>kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang</malay>
then I say you were together last year <malay>macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk</malay> primary five <malay>semua macam gini</malay> things like that so in the end <malay>kita salam</malay> and <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada</malay> proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> stay back
and I knew the history of all this <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>orang tengah semua benda aku tahu</malay> [ah] yes
ya <malay>tapi</malay> time <malay>rapat dengan dia</malay> so ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kakak tak suka tu</malay> primary five <malay>bila</malay> but then <malay>bila dah masuk</malay> secondary <malay>kita masih</malay> split class <malay>sampai</malay> secondary one time <malay>tu pun</malay> sec one a <malay>lawan dengan</malay> sec one B
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal kita</malay> just annoyed <malay>dengan dorang</malay> like there was this one trend <malay>semua orang akan pakai</malay> this jacket do you know my jacket <malay>bukan</malay> varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket <malay>yang kau tahu yang</malay> grey and another pink
pink <malay>dengan</malay> blue star <malay>aku selalu pakai bila</malay> bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack <malay>kat belakang</malay> do you know what <malay>aku punya</malay> backpack <malay>yang</malay> colour brown <malay>yang boleh</malay> clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls <malay>dorang pakai tu</malay>
and I was so annoyed <malay>pasal dorang macam</malay> flaunt <malay>dorang punya</malay> because it was in trend and <malay>dorang macam</malay> flaunt and the whole group <malay>nanti ambil gambar</malay> and things like that <malay>abeh aku</malay> annoyed <malay>gila</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku pun tak suka dorang</malay> then comes the teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time [tau] so <malay>bila tengah</malay> teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate instead of <malay>tolong</malay> decorate <malay>aku punya</malay> class
<malay>dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong</malay> decorate [kan] <malay>kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam</malay> [oh] my god <malay>abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang</malay> until <malay>dorang</malay> secondary one
then <malay>bila kita orang masuk</malay> secondary two <malay>kita sama kelas balik</malay>
so it was like primary five primary six secondary one
<malay>kita orang</malay> different class after that <malay>bila masuk balik</malay> secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two <malay>pasal</malay> by then pun <malay>kita dah pindah dekat</malay> #toa payoh# [kan] so classroom <malay>dah lagi besar</malay> so <malay>bila yang</malay> secondary two <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>kita orang macam ada</malay> certain <malay>orang kita tak</malay> click <malay>sebab dia gatal</malay>
but other certain students we are okay with them [ah] by then <malay>kita dah</malay> quite click then after that <malay>bila masuk</malay> secondary three end of secondary three <malay>kita ada</malay> secondary three camp
[ah] whereby <malay>dalam</malay> secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby <malay>kita orang semua sama-sama</malay> except <malay>kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya</malay> time
so other than <malay>kita orang semua tak sama-sama</malay> actually <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>semua orang</malay> start <malay>rapat</malay>
<malay>tak kita tidur pasal penat</malay>
(um) level one <malay>ni kat sekolah mana</malay>
[ah] level one meaning
[oh]
should be something stupid
girls
[oh]
I think the only time whereby <malay>kita orang tak tidur sekolah</malay> so last time <malay>kita ada</malay> was one week and
<malay>apa ni kita orang ada</malay> arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language <malay>paling susah</malay> [kan] so what was <malay>ustazah</malay> #mashallah# <malay>beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur</malay> a day before the paper I think that was thursday <malay>kira</malay> arabic paper was on friday so <malay>dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang</malay> so the reason why <malay>kita semua tidur kat sekolah</malay> was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead <malay>kita</malay> of course girls being girls when we are together <malay>kita orang ketawa-ketawa</malay> and the thing is only girls <malay>yang tidur</malay>
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> and there was only one <malay>ustaz</malay> and another male student to accompany the <malay>ustaz</malay> [lah] is the only guy in school <malay>ustaz</malay> was there to look after us [lah] <malay>tak akan kalau</malay> all girls <malay>kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi</malay> [kan]
then after that during <malay>kita orang punya ni ada</malay> something happen again so <malay>kita orang tidur dekat</malay> creepy honestly even <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh</malay> and last time <malay>tak ada cermin</malay> last time there was no mirrors then we <malay>bila dah</malay> new <malay>sikit</malay> that is scary [lah] so last time <malay>bila masih tengah kat</malay> <malay>kita orang semua tengah duduk</malay> it was already at eleven plus
[mah] then <malay>kita orang pun dah habis</malay> revise because we going to wake up earlier before <malay>subuh</malay> the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] exam <malay>dia esok pagi semua</malay> student <malay>datang balik</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat arabiah dekat</malay> hall
then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
so was it in hall
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom <malay>yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang</malay> facing parade square I think it was there
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby <malay>kereta jalan</malay> then <malay>bunyi</malay> imagine #ustaz muhammad# <malay>kereta</malay> was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so <malay>tak gerakkan kereta pun</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>yang kereta jalan</malay> ya
except for staff
park <malay>kereta dekat depan</malay>
other side
[oh] <malay>yang sebelah</malay> security <malay>punya</malay> ya
and it couldn't be from the road <malay>pasal</malay> road <malay>dah jauh</malay>
the real do
[oh] ya
so <malay>kakak punya</malay> the more okay I
<malay>tak pernah</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda seram</malay>
<malay>sampai orang</malay> point out
so meaning <malay>ataupun</malay> staycation <malay>ingat</malay> staycation <malay>dekat dengan</malay> old #changi# hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel <malay>pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku macam tahu tempat dia</malay> very eerie very <malay>seram</malay>
our chalet time <malay>kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis</malay> the whole thing <malay>baru orang cakap kau rasa bila</malay> [oh] it wasn't only me
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay <malay>tapi itu bukan</malay> the most scariest experience <malay>aku ada</malay> the one imagine <malay>ada satu kali tu kita orang ada</malay> staycation [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> staycation <malay>yang</malay> chalet <malay>dekat</malay> #pasir ris#
#pasir ris# holiday flat time <malay>itu</malay> #pasir ris# holiday flat <malay>baru</malay> renovate <malay>lagi sekali</malay> [tau] they just renewed renovated that's why <malay>kita</malay> the year before is at #changi# <malay>yang kita ambil</malay>
then the following year <malay>baru kita buat kat</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>pasal dorang dah</malay> renovate <malay>tempat dia</malay> so [ah] so that time <malay>aku pasal aku tak boleh</malay> overnight that day <malay>kita orang buat</malay> barbecue <malay>aku tolong</malay> the day before
<malay>pasal</malay> after that day barbecue [kan] <malay>kita balik siang cik</malay> #shahrul# fetch <malay>kita orang</malay>
so I decided to help a day earlier because <malay>kita ambil</malay> four days three night so thursday just <malay>ambil kunci</malay> friday <malay>datang petang</malay> decorate prepare <malay>benda-benda</malay> barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the <malay>punya macam</malay> retreat <malay>pasal tengah ada</malay> submission
poly submission so <malay>yang tolong cuma lima orang</malay> [jer] <malay>akak</malay>
#kak sumayah# <malay>dengan lagi tiga kakak ni</malay> [ah] #kak jah# #kak nana# #kak nisa# so <malay>kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda</malay> [tau]
<malay>dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>tinggal kakak dengan</malay> #kak maya# <malay>tengah</malay> prepare <malay>pasal</malay> #kak maya# in charge of the creation
so <malay>aku tolong</malay> [ah] #kak maya# <malay>potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik</malay> remember the <malay>batik</malay> thing <malay>yang korang dapat</malay> EZ-link

so <malay>nak kena kemas-kemas</malay> then after that <malay>terus dorang balik</malay> so <malay>dorang balik dorang letak benda</malay> and still <malay>nak kena keluar beli benda</malay> [tau]
so then it was three of us <malay>sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja</malay> thirty minutes <malay>ke apa</malay> later
<malay>terus</malay> google <malay>punya ni</malay> google no it was google [ah] google [ah] <malay>atau</malay> SIRI SIRI <malay>ada pakai</malay> iphone
you have arrived at your destination
<malay>terus semua orang macam</malay>
don't say anything don't say anything <malay>tengah buat kerja</malay>
#astaghfirullah# #astaghfirullah# then after that <malay>terus balik</malay> [ah] imagine <malay>balik kul dua belas lebih daripada</malay> #pasir ris#
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] the chalet we slept is <malay>tengah-tengah laut</malay> [eh] is at <malay>hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok</malay> #pasir ris# park
[ah] [ah] [ah]
so like <malay>terus kita orang macam</malay> (hmm) that was the
the closest
scary experience <malay>pasal aku sendiri dengar</malay> I myself heard
that thing that beyond that <malay>macam aku kadang</malay> is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story <malay>yang aku tengok</malay> or was it just me but this [one] everyone heard and everyone was like <malay>macam</malay>
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then <malay>cepat-cepat</malay> [ah] <malay>habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu</malay>
but you don't seem like one <malay>aku nak tengok cerita hantu</malay>
mafia
for telegram <malay>ke</malay>
spy [lah] spy four
classroom <malay>yang mana</malay> which classroom
[oh] [ah] okay
so you will like
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the <malay>dia punya ni</malay>
but did you guys select the correct number of people playing
[ah]
<malay>mengundang</malay> [kan] <malay>mengundang</malay>
but those one of the stupid things <malay>korang buat lepas aku</malay> it was polytechnic <malay>punya</malay> time like it was during it was between <malay>kita orang punya</malay> from one class to another [oh] from one consultation to another consultation the session <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> [eh]
no it was during year three three point one where we still have a few attorney modules final modules to the end
ya but it's that is like the
other half
so <malay>macam daripada</malay> april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
all the way till april [lah]
[eh] all the way to january [eh] march all the way to march [lah]
then <malay>kita orang tengah tengok</malay> so from one class to another class is like three hours break <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> class straight so during that three hours we have our own <malay>lepak</malay> place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class [ah] tap to <malay>masuk</malay>
<malay>pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk</malay> so it became our <malay>macam</malay> hangout room for our course [ah]
so what happened was the <malay>dia punya</malay> laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
the most creative guy ever
<malay>tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai</malay> projector <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kita</malay> have access to <malay>main cerita dia macam</malay> cupboard <malay>dia buka</malay>
<malay>dia yang buka</malay> the whole thing [ah] so <malay>kita buat</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>pakai macam</malay> ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a <malay>macam</malay> he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by <malay>dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa</malay> so
<malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] so should be okay so <malay>kita tengok</malay> movie so like majority of us were in the class <malay>tengah tengok</malay> movie and
since <malay>dia</malay> is a glass door <malay>dia</malay> glass door <malay>kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita</malay> but then the glass door <malay>dia tutup dengan</malay> projector <malay>kau faham</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita</malay> facing projector <malay>belakang</malay> projector glass door <malay>kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok</malay> so like <malay>macam</malay> some of my classmate <malay>dorang tak nak duduk tengok</malay> movie <malay>dorang nak keluar</malay> or <malay>lepak</malay> with others the mix [ah] from different courses or just <malay>nak pergi</malay> lunch so one of <malay>aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap</malay> [eh] what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
the average age of students in the class were like what between
seven [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six <malay>umur yang</malay> twenty six <malay>yang buka cerita</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>kau faham tak</malay> so we were watching shaun the sheep <malay>abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa</malay> after that <malay>kita tengok cerita apa</malay> [tau] final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend <malay>yang</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>keluar dia masuk balik</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tengok</malay> final destination five <malay>dia macam</malay> !wow! you guys [ah] <malay>asal tengok</malay> one <malay>cerita</malay> to the other <malay>tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa</malay> but that was one of the best <malay>ni</malay> [lah]
and another best thing I <malay>yang kita orang pernah buat</malay> was
<malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>dekat</malay> airport
poly
<malay>akak punya</malay> clique my clique <malay>dengan</malay> a few guys so time <malay>tu kita orang dah habis</malay>
I think <malay>sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal</malay> that day I think that day was
<malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two <malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two [ah] <malay>kita orang main</malay> hide and seek the thing is <malay>kita orang tak boleh</malay> hide <malay>dekat</malay> toilet [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> boys <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> girls toilet girls <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> but it was so fun
we should play hide and seek at the airport you know
okay [lah] not now [lah] but
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play <malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>paling</malay> best
!huh!
[ah] going to another classroom
thinking of all the possibilities that it could not be what I thinking it is
ya and then I ask my friend [lah] which I
and why you describing it to me now I'm starting to imagine okay
(um)
[ah]
are you sitting by the window
[ah] <malay>teman</malay>
[ah]
<malay>kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram</malay> [ah] so during <malay>kita orang punya</malay>
secondary four secondary five <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] no is different <malay>tak ada</malay> during our time <malay>tak ada</malay> such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate <malay>kita pergi</malay> overseas <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia and visit universities to <malay>macam kononnya</malay> future <malay>nak kenal-kenal</malay> [ah] universities <malay>luar</malay> singapore
so <malay>kita orang semua dapat bilik</malay> hotel okay [lah] actually <malay>ni cerita seram</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita orang dapat bilik</malay> hotel so there are <malay>kita orang dibagi</malay> like our classes are being divided into three levels so example <malay>dia</malay> level seven eight nine so level seven <malay>semua</malay> guys
level nine <malay>semua</malay> girls
level eight either mix of guys either mix of girls
so <malay>macam</malay> guys <malay>punya</malay> room this thing is the guys room is <malay>sebelah depan</malay> girls room <malay>sebelah belakang</malay>
so there was this one time
<malay>jauh daripada</malay> lift so you have to walk in like <malay>macam</malay> and my room is one of the last few room for that floor <malay>kita orang punya</malay> that level <malay>kita punya</malay> room last few
<malay>akak punya bilik</malay>
and #kak mun# was also on the same floor so <malay>kita dua bukan</malay> the type <malay>yang akan takut</malay> because we usually travel go hotel [kan] so <malay>macam benda ni tak akan</malay> occur unless before this <malay>kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual</malay> which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room [lah] so time <malay>tu kita ada</malay> <malay>ada macam</malay> seminar <malay>sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya</malay> hall [ah] so <malay>aku dengan</malay> #kak mun# <malay>pun terlupa</malay> something so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> rush <malay>pergi bilik</malay> so #kak mun# <malay>dengan bilik aku sama</malay> level [ah]
so <malay>kita masuk terus</malay> time <malay>tu ada</malay> hall and it's a long way [tau] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the corridor <malay>macam panjang</malay> have to pass by around ten rooms
the room <malay>dia macam</malay> zig zag
so #kak mun# <malay>punya</malay> room is around seven <malay>aku punya</malay> room eleven <malay>tak salah</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> floor <malay>tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dorang</malay> split <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>lepas tu kita orang lari</malay>
<malay>terus aku tengok</malay> #kak mun# <malay>tengok</malay> each other <malay>lari masuk bilik letak benda lari</malay>

how you <malay>lepak</malay> in malaysia
[ah] close when you want to go there you have to pass by

(mmhmm)
as I was saying so it was night time like if people know me people know when my <malay>lepak</malay> time starts <malay>apa</malay> damn late
so it's like okay [lah] sure [lah] you have you have car right of course we can go

you have to turn in
<malay>dia kira macam</malay> you <malay>tahu macam lorong tikus lorong kecil dekat</malay> malaysia <malay>tu</malay>
so it's exactly like that except last time it was one way now it has become two way
but there is no light no nothing whatsoever
then as we turn right on our left side it is old estate
so inside there as he claims <malay>ada pasar ada kedai runcit</malay> like like a total estate [lah] <malay>cuma</malay>
<malay>cuma</malay> people just evacuate
from there

so so they mentioned that that place is (uh) for those fisherman
who are in the fishery <malay>punya</malay> industry
<malay>aku macam</malay> okay [lah]
<malay>dia boleh buka tingkap</malay> [eh] <malay>itu kau tengok itu tu aku cakap kau tutup</malay> [lah] <malay>fahmi kau tutup tak kau tengok yang bawah tu itu</malay> then he like stop the car and he showed us around from on top because we have to go down actually if you want to go in then I say don't want [lah] why would I right we are going to eat [what]

so I <malay>diam</malay>
then like that again at the corner of my eyes it's just like that again then okay

<malay>kira pada</malay> you you <malay>macam</malay> !siala! <malay>aku mangsa keadaan</malay> [seh] <malay>aku tengah menjalani hidup aku</malay>
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is [lah] but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
ya so like they all tell me the story I'm like [ah] ya ya ya ya and then later this new person <malay>mama dia</malay> was like she found one yet and I'm like (uh) (uh) <malay>nurul kata memang ada</malay>
like you what me you what you want me to do like
I never see but like it's it's true <malay>benda memang jadi</malay>
so I cannot deny [lah] I <malay>rasa mesti ada</malay>
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
you close club at ten o'clock ten [oh] ten ten ten you never come out the thing <malay>halau</malay> you [lah] [sia]
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
<malay>budak-budak sana</malay> [lah]
so minnie minnie <malay>kena apa</malay> [tau] closing and minnie is a kind that's not like us [tau] <malay>macam pakai benda terus buka boleh keluar</malay>
hers is like <malay>memang kena tukar seluar baju</malay> makeup bag alright
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
suddenly she turn around <malay>ada orang macam dia rasa ada orang pekik dekat muka dia</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
you know right so that stairs minnie <malay>pernah jalan</malay>
<malay>orang tolak dia benda tolak dia gila babi sampai dia terus</malay> land <malay>dekat bawah</malay>
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
<malay>orang tolak dia terus macam</malay> <malay>lepas tu dia terus jatuh dia jatuh</malay> all the way to the to the floor
(mm) (mm) all the way down
<malay>terus macam</malay> okay
ya so like the the part where
the <malay>benda</malay> will always
the <malay>benda</malay> will always <malay>macam apa ni</malay>
(uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay>
ya like
bang the weights all this <malay>semua orang pernah kena</malay>
everyone that's one hundred always <malay>tutup</malay> exactly
ten O two
ten o'clock <malay>semua orang dia dah halau</malay>
because <malay>dia orang pun tak nak kena</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang ni</malay> real [siol]
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
the connected to the hotel <malay>apa</malay> the for the swimming pool
ya maybe so
<malay>pagi orang</malay> opening shift so opening shift
<malay>masuk</malay>
no opening shift is <malay>masuk</malay> !siala! I open the shutter I have to be the first person there
unless I open shutter aunty cleaner <malay>ada</malay>
with me
then there will be two of us correct
<malay>dia</malay> open shutter <malay>dia nampak</malay> member <malay>jalan</malay>
so <malay>dia macam</malay> sir the gym is not open yet
<malay>kau</malay> first person [tau] <malay>buka apa yang kau nak berbual dengan</malay> member
so (uh) then I say why you why you say like that no because I didn't think like that [lah] I think <malay>macam</malay> member <malay>macam</malay> (uh) coming from the the swimming pool like you forget to lock the door or what then he sneak in
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say [ah]
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
so this person <malay>jalan</malay> towards this treadmill <malay>ni</malay> pillar [eh] <malay>jalan</malay> this way so this I thought <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau nak main</malay> catching I will walk here and <malay>kejar</malay> you surround you here
so <malay>dia dah tunggu sini tunggu tunggu tunggu orang ni tak jalan-jalan</malay> so <malay>dia tengok tak ada</malay>
and <malay>dia macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>orang ni dah keluar pergi</malay> back door <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah keluar balik dekat</malay> shutter <malay>dia pergi tengok dekat</malay> <malay>dia berbual seorang</malay>
<malay>dia kejar benda</malay> nothing
and then me <malay>asal kau buka</malay> <malay>asal kau</malay> very curious
<malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak kena tengok betul-betul apa dia masuk daripada pintu mana aku nak tengok</malay> closing shift <malay>semalam tak tutup pintu ke apa</malay> I need to know
<malay>sekarang kau dah tahu sendiri kau berbual dengan siapa tu</malay>
<malay>kau nak hidup kau ni sekarang apa maksud dia</malay> <malay>hidup kau tak ada makna</malay> [tau] <malay>hidup kau tu permainan syaitan</malay>
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
<malay>macam benda yang macam kena tolak ni semua</malay> okay [ah] <malay>kena kena pekik</malay> you know you hear it you feel the air but you don't see it
<malay>tapi ni sampai kau nampak orang</malay>
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
(uh) you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
<malay>terus dah</malay> tired <malay>gitu</malay> and then
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so #lasiri# was sleeping
<malay>terus dia kena hempap</malay>
so [ah] so ya people when they say <malay>hempap</malay> [eh] <malay>hempap ni semua dia ada</malay> scientific reason
there is a scientific reason for all that [what]
then
when I say cannot [ah] will say no bro
when I <malay>tengah itu aku buka aku dapat buka mata cuma aku tak dapat pekik aku dapat buka mata</malay>
<malay>aku dapat buka mata</malay> [kan] and then
and then <malay>dia kata apa ni</malay>
(err) I saw the <malay>lembaga</malay>
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer [what] so she went to this one guy
!hey! bro
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [eh] chest <malay>aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau kena hempap</malay>
then <malay>dia macam</malay> !huh! <malay>aku tak bilang kau apa-apa apa</malay>
how you know
<malay>aku pun kena</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan lembaga besar</malay> [kan] <malay>mata merah</malay> !huh! <malay>kau pun kena aku dah selalu kena</malay> #wei#
ya so this so <malay>bermakna</malay> before she even tell that guy that guy already know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like [eh] maybe real #siot#
[kan]
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night

<malay>pasar makan</malay> [jer]
like malay food I would not recommend [ah] it's like to me like cannot make it
only their breakfast
(mm) not really
!hey! actually okay [lah] but then like I cannot I condemn <malay>nasi campur melayu</malay>
it's so <malay>mahal</malay>
[oh] I found I found a place okay everything in there is halal
it's called my <malay>kampung</malay>
#kallang# way
so they have like korean they have everything japanese
chinese stall you know <malay>tak</malay> chinese stall <malay>yang macam</malay> economy rice
but they make it <malay>nasi padang</malay>
and they follow okay two veggie one
meat three dollar eighty cent
cheap right they really follow the economy style
ya and then <malay>tempat</malay> then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
downside is it only accept cash
ya
(uh) then [ah] old #chang kee# accept paywave
[ah]
I think what
cause
got waffle also then I just feel like I want to
<malay>sebelah dia ada</malay> waffle
no [lah]
how the heck are they going to fry the waffle
!wow!
!wow! like the double down something like that
(mm) not bad
waffle is swensen no no the thing is I cannot with swensen
the food is not great the service is low
I cannot [ah] swensen is just so [meh]
I would rather
you put me at pizza hut
rather than swensen
choices ya
[oh]
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
[oh]
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
(uh) (uh)
the bread is the sourdough
#siot# [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> mood [sia]
(uh) it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
(uh) (uh)
(uh) pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very very very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
!wah! means you reach work #swee# #swee# [sia]
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know [lah] every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace [ah] that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
[oh] then you can walk
you quite smart [hor]
I've never thought of that [leh]
!wow!
shit
ya but because I think like clifford <malay>tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh</malay> clifford <malay>kena tempuh</malay> like [tau]
okay

so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world <malay>sebab bila</malay> you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things <malay>yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat</malay>
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) <malay>pasal ilmu ni</malay> but <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> (err) <malay>rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau dapat ni</malay> best [ah] <malay>pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat</malay> (mm) and <malay>bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni</malay> (mm)
so <malay>ini adalah yang tiga</malay> wishes <malay>yang saya nak</malay> (mm) so <malay>kita</malay> (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
<malay>pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh</malay> spend on whatever and what not and <malay>bila awak dapat</malay> spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending <malay>awak akan rasa</malay> this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
<malay>kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang</malay> teleport <malay>ke tempat lain</malay> so <malay>dia jadi</malay> the source of this (err) <malay>kuman</malay> [lah] so <malay>dia yang</malay> spread to others
<malay>dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus</malay> (mm) so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay <malay>mungkin awak dah cakap ini</malay> okay maybe <malay>saya</malay> agree <malay>sikit</malay>
maybe <malay>awak ada</malay> point over there
<malay>tapi yang</malay> contact tracing <malay>tu mungkin tak tak senangkan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia</malay> teleport <malay>kalau dia sendiri dah suka</malay> teleport
(mm) <malay>tapi ini</malay> interesting point of view (mm) so <malay>kalau awak tanya saya apa</malay> superpower <malay>yang saya nak saya nak</malay> power of regeneration
so <malay>contohnya</malay> (err) <malay>jari saya terpotong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia akan</malay> heal <malay>sendiri</malay>
<malay>saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki</malay> dislocate [ah] dia regenerate <malay>sendiri</malay>
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
<malay>dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang</malay> high risk
<malay>itu meminta kematian</malay> [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe <malay>satu hari bila dah dah</malay> experienced everything <malay>yang kita nak</malay> [ah]
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay <malay>mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya</malay> and <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena</malay>
<malay>bergaul dengan orang untuk untuk memahami keadaan orang</malay>
<malay>sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang</malay> we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example <malay>bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong</malay> so <malay>kita akan mencari</malay> solution <malay>untuk menolong seseorang itu</malay>
so <malay>mungkin apa awak cakap</malay> (err) <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] and <malay>tapi bila awak</malay> (err) <malay>saya</malay>
(hmm) <malay>hairan</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa awak</malay> (err) question <malay>bila seseorang itu nak</malay> isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then <malay>anak-anak dia akan merana</malay> [ah] and
<malay>kalau</malay> months okay months maybe <malay>saya rasa maksimum</malay> (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that <malay>mungkin</malay> okay
<malay>kenapa</malay> nine months <malay>sebab</malay> within this nine months (um) <malay>budak tu dia akan</malay> grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay <malay>soalan tu</malay> interesting <malay>sepuluh tahun</malay> means <malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay>
<malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay> okay <malay>saya</malay> definitely <malay>akan suruh diri saya</malay> (err) <malay>ini</malay> [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
<malay>sebab</malay> at <malay>umur</malay> ten years old <malay>memang awak cakap betul</malay> (uh) <malay>nak nak faham tentang</malay> certain <malay>barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat</malay> convince [ah]
satu orang ni</malay> at ten years old <malay>dia akan ingat</malay>
and maybe along the way <malay>mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas</malay> and then <malay>dia akan</malay> start
(err) thinking back (err) <malay>apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya</malay> ten years <malay>bila saya ten-year-old</malay> <malay>akan</malay> <malay>betul</malay>
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so <malay>mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan</malay> (err) (um) <malay>akan</malay> interest <malay>awak</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> maybe one day <malay>juga awak akan jadi</malay> famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) <malay>apa yang</malay> experience <malay>awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian</malay>
I need to add on <malay>apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati</malay>
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> capsize <malay>habis tu bila</malay> capsize <malay>ini kita kena</malay> grab <malay>kawan kita punya kayak</malay>
and get back up [ah] so <malay>bila saya tengah</malay> practice capsize <malay>ini</malay>
instructor <malay>jauh</malay> so <malay>kita jauh daripada semua orang</malay>
<malay>habis tu kita bila saya tengah</malay> capsize <malay>kawan saya dia</malay> lose control of <malay>dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah</malay> capsize <malay>terus saya</malay> tap <malay>saya punya kayak</malay>
<malay>bila saya tengok terbalik ini</malay> so <malay>kawan saya punya bot tak ada</malay>
<malay>saya dekat situ saya</malay> stuck [ah] <malay>saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada</malay> skirt skirt <malay>ini akan</malay> prevent water from entering our kayak
<malay>nak keluarkan</malay> skirt <malay>tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay>
tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> (uh) in hope that <malay>kawan saya dengar saya</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal saya tengah dekat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap tap tap <malay>dia tak dengar</malay> alright <malay>bila dia dengar ini dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay> incident <malay>dia cuba</malay> paddle <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tolak dia</malay> so <malay>dia nak</malay> paddle <malay>susah sikit</malay>
so <malay>saya dekat bawah air</malay> maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
but I was skateboarding and <malay>dalam mimpi tu saya rasa</malay> best <malay>nak bila</malay> skateboard <malay>ni rasa seronok</malay> [jer] and
<malay>bila</malay> skateboard <malay>tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun</malay> [oh] [eh] <malay>rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak</malay> skateboard [ah] [ah] <malay>dari situlah saya start</malay>
start skateboard <malay>tapi nak belajar</malay> skateboard <malay>ni dia susah sangat</malay> (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
and <malay>bila dapat tahan</malay> breath <malay>saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar</malay> (uh) free dive and that time <malay>bila kat</malay> swimming pool (uh) <malay>saya ada</malay> swimming <malay>dekat</malay> nine metre pool [ah] [ah] <malay>itu saya cuba</malay>
and <malay>dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat sampai ke</malay> bottom <malay>tapi I was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
so you have anything to add on

so <malay>sekarang</malay> you uni <malay>mana</malay>
what course
(mm) how long again
one year
you gonna leave me for one year girl
!wow! really
the house also <malay>dia</malay> provide

but can you in countryside I'm gonna work
probably probably
I'm thinking to asking for an upgrade to a senior so ya (hmm) yes
one year that's my one year yes
I planning to change to

if I don't
work under healthcare then it's either health in it's either healthcare or (um) (um) <malay>apa ni</malay>

so if childcare I have to go back study
but
to think of the money as well
ya [lah] but see [lah] how
(mmhmm)
(um) (um) <malay>ada</malay> not not all [eh] <malay>ada ada ada</malay>
<malay>kakak aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tanya</malay> because <malay>itu semua dekat</malay> they all <malay>dekat ni</malay> #paya lebar#
you know the #paya lebar# <malay>punya</malay> there's a one the one that we took the yes there's the one that we took the food hygiene course yes over there
so it's over there but okay [lah] I think it's quite
okay yes
because what my friend say we can
study also if <malay>bayar</malay> you know the whatever the (um)
during secondary school <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount of money [oh] the
ya that thing then they can deduct so after deduction I think you can just pay like a few hundred
by the age of twenty five I want to get marry girl
and I see [lah] you see [lah] I work continue health care until I get pregnant
<malay>lepas</malay>
healthcare you if you until pregnant the benefit is good
(um) that's more benefit
if not then
(um) ya true if not
then I will see [lah] if my pay still the same no increment no ya not like
no increase in anything then
find new job [lor] either go back admin
that's the thing admin actually earn a lot <malay>cuma</malay> my previous work is
<malay>merepek</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] ya still you bring home a lot [leh] but it okay she go means
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel

say <malay>apa ni</malay> because you also travelling
(uh)
so she don't have to move
!whoa! but then she got to study law

admin is a good thinking back then
you need to think a lot [ah] ya I want the two years experience and then see how
cause a lot of people also picking like child from there it's it is
[oh] my god speaking of that
<malay>aku ada</malay> doctor <malay>baru</malay> [seh]

(mm)
okay so (um) our marriage (uh) now is five years already yes okay so you're talking about (uh) the starting point or just current
(mm)
(mm) okay
(mm)
what okay
planning
okay
[oh]
okay
now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done (uh) last one is done [lah]
okay if let's say right for me [ah] if I plan [eh] sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing [ah] better don't plan just go you say like you will say (uh) if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
the other side will be like (uh) [oh] no I want this one [ah] [eh] you cannot I plan already [mah] so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think [eh] want to get married it's not going to be (uh) sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later [lah] <malay>nanti dulu berbual</malay> so <malay>sekarang kita</malay> go <malay>dulu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> later part then we can plan <malay>lepas tu buat</malay> plan K (uh) getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house [mah]
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle [lah]
[ah] that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust [lah] each other have their own trust
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like <malay>macam</malay> you know [lah] to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
then just go (mmhmm)
okay
[ah]
okay I guess correct ya
(hmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah] yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
okay
(mmhmm)
decision [lah] ya
[ha] yes correct that that that's on my wife correct

so
we tell them nevermind but we take a few hours [eh]
a a few an hour or two to tell them what to do they cannot (uh) give them give it give the result [leh]
so this is a problem okay okay so this is what happen [lah] and I and I was very disappointing because because what one thing [ha] disappointed [ah] very disappointed
because I I thought this one is a is a good in you know you can converse converse it very good because we can (um) the price is okay just that we cannot give they cannot give the result what what you want that's the problem I don't know why
in a lot of
they they actually translates from malay to english #ang mo kio# and correct the that's one of the reason why you don't want we don't want to take them on their we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day I was so fed up I just and then they cannot give me anything like I say you nevermind
[ah] correct

(uh) not <malay>dia tak sama tapi serupa</malay> [lah] okay so <malay>pasal</malay> (uh) travelling [eh] okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon [lah] the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
honeymoon was (err)
plan

and malaysia
so there's no other <malay>dia tak ada pergi tempat lain</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> long distance that time <malay>nak</malay> go <malay>mana</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi mana</malay> cambodia [eh] !huh! that time was the last time so I don't know that passport <malay>dah habis pasal</malay> I not a travelling guy
so <malay>bila</malay> part <malay>nak pergi</malay> honeymoon <malay>tu</malay> I using that passport [lah] <malay>yang lama tu</malay> then <malay>sampai</malay> airport
<malay>tak dapat pergi</malay>
so
that time I thought my wife [eh] then <malay>kita baru kahwin</malay> [kan] so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
[ha] that time [kan] I think !wah! I married a a I married a I married a rightful girl [eh]
<malay>dia tak marah dia</malay> just <malay>cakap aja</malay> !alamak! it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
<malay>tapi dia tak</malay> expose <malay>dia punya marah tu kat</malay> airport so we plan that was <malay>macam</malay> I literally divert [tau] <malay>pergi</malay> malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport <malay>lepas</malay> so <malay>dia kata</malay> can pass through [ah] my wife <malay>pergi</malay> book every <malay>yang mana yang nak pergi</malay> so that part [eh] she really a hardcore <malay>dia boleh</malay> book
hotel on the spot
so <malay>kita pergi mana dulu</malay> [ah] cameron highland first <malay>baru</malay> drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places [lah] [eh] under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there [lah] it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow [eh] <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> [ah] somewhere like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) korea <malay>ke itu kita</malay> plan <malay>apa kita nak</malay> plan plan plan <malay>sampai pergi tapi ini tak</malay> [tau] <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> #bandung# <malay>dulu nak pergi</malay> #bandung# then airport (uh) then passport <malay>dia habis</malay> (uh) <malay>mati</malay> then <malay>lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain</malay> and that was not planned
(mm) so <malay>kita</malay> ramp
that time so I have to drive [lah] so then I think my wife my wife should realise [lah] until now [eh] I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that <malay>dia tahu</malay> [tau] [eh] my husband can you know something not something fall

thanks to the passport [ah] thanks to the passport
so something lesson learned [lah] sometime <malay>kalau kita pergi</malay> #bandung# <malay>pun</malay> it's a one way trip <malay>dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun</malay> whereas <malay>kalau kat</malay> malaysia <malay>ni kita pergi macam</malay>

so how you can say regret no no no no not not really [lah] if something like <malay>macam benda yang</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau tahu buat ni takde takde</malay> it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>baru nak menyesal</malay> then we're going backward
<malay>kita akan ke belakang diri sendiri</malay>
for the wedding service not the goal for for us [lah]
I I'm not going to plan for a good wedding (uh) because for me it's very just a day or the marriage is is the marriage actually it's not a wedding
so <malay>tu yang</malay> best [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
marriage <malay>sekarang ni ke apa</malay> [oh] okay

interesting as well because I have my own money [kan] very interesting <malay>tapi</malay>
it comes with costs [lah] which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
come back at home like for six and then at ten <malay>dah kelat sebab penat</malay> and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me [lah] so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
(err) more me time

that's that's my own definition of me time [ah]
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that [ah]
I want to enroll in piano class
[a'ah] <malay>betul dulu ingatkan abah</malay> [kan] <malay>main</malay> guitar [kan] then <malay>semua anak-anak abah ni</malay> [kan] <malay>angah sorang</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>ada keinginan nak main</malay> guitar <malay>kecil-kecil dulu</malay> [kan]
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not [lah] not to be like professional guitarist [lah] no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was (err) in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard [ah] and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
so I yes <malay>darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu</malay>

(uh) I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay>

something <malay>yang dah ada</malay> base [eh]
<malay>ada satu yang angah teringin nak</malay> (err) enroll in mandarin class [a'ah] I don't know [ah] I think I really I really have strong interest in language
[oh] is it I don't know about that but
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin (err) is my choice right now because
(um)
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
(err) instead of english
(mm) (mm)
this is good for my networking [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(err) and
I remember that
(err) I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
(err) sadly only one language is (err) permissible for for for a student (err) we can only choose one additional language to learn
japanese [a'ah]
malay english arabic japanese korea
drama and also movies and songs I think that sometimes I can even understand why the actors are saying without me reading the subtitles yes
means really
(mmhmm)
so when mandarin comes it will be six !wow! (mmhmm)
<malay>apa dia</malay> [a'ah]

(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
and one more thing I think <malay>macam macam kak long kata</malay> [lah] <malay>belum kaya lagi</malay> [kan] but in the process in the journey <malay>sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu</malay>
you actually contribute a lot to the society (mm) from the the fundraising that you made or <malay>daripada</malay> the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually <malay>walaupun tak kaya</malay> but it means a lot [kan]
(mm) (mm)
what
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
[a'ah]
and explore
so as someone who has been in business for quite a while
what is your advice for a startup <malay>macam angah</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
it will come soon not too long #inshallah#
<malay>tapi cakap pasal</malay> start up <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi</malay> [tau]
#han ji pyeong# <malay>patut jadi</malay> hero
[ah]
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
[kan]
<malay>pasal dia dah</malay> bring the character <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm) (mm)
that's true
yes
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>tu tapi</malay> #nam do san# <malay>tu</malay> !hais! <malay>geram</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tengok</malay>
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>cuma jadi kaya</malay>
<malay>ada kereta juga</malay>
(um) <malay>ni macam</malay> very small small small thing <malay>tapi</malay> important [lah]
[kan]
<malay>tak nak</malay> procrastinate [ah]
[kan] <malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi</malay> <malay>faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh</malay> [ha] #hapo# <malay>pun takde</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> (err) and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better <malay>faham ke macam</malay> like very last minute <malay>tapi</malay> it push us to to make a better thing <malay>faham ke</malay> ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard [lah] actually <malay>faham ke sebab</malay> ya maybe maybe
so <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> deadline [kan] deadline is twentieth october [lah] <malay>konon</malay> [kan] but the boss want to see the progress <malay>bukannya</malay> on twenty nine <malay>tu</malay> I can do everything <malay>faham ke</malay>
yes <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
(hmm) <malay>tapi susah</malay> [lah]
<malay>sekali</malay>
(uh huh)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
