eh Nads</P2 I haven't seen you in a long time ah
me too ah like as usual ah you know
so like okay ah so I know you recently came back from Australia ah how was it ah Nads</P2
mm
mm right right
then like
what what you study over there ah like in Australia
uh uh
mm
ya ya alright
me what school
now I in ah
Singapore Poly ah that's
mm
so like okay so
err for like my third year kan
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job ah
so like
ya that's why ah cannot ah you know
for me I don't know ah we usually we like homesick ah you know so I go
on overseas
ah
uh I haven't pick yet ah any yet
club activities kan so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
mm
ya
mm
okay ah I find floorball quite interesting ah like
but like honestly it's not something I like ah as a sport ah you know if
uh sports ah I will definitely choose something else ah
maybe like okay so for they got clubs ah
okay so you know got different schools right
then you got my school lah called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs ah
so my one is uh club
uh interview eh um when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply kan then I went for the interview
ah that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like walao eh
ah
ya that's why
ah that's why mm
ya ya true ah it's okay lah
sports
clubs ah I think clubs can ah but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can ah so possible
kay
so like for you kan Nads</P2
your school what what course you take ah for you I know you are in year one but what course ah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
then what are the modules you will like learn
mmhmm
mmhmm okay
ah
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me lah cause I got experience in secondary school kan
ah like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is uh about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A ah you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun ah for me
really enjoy ah cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun lah
ya
ya
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three ah is where like the interesting part lah
cause no no no before the internship kan
what ah the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine uh fuel system you know so like for us uh students right before we go for internship right you must understand ah all these kind of uh machinery how it works
cause if we just go for uh what ah
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills ah before our internship
oh what also ah
oh ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this mm
eh they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
uh
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like uh as the water level rises so it's about five minutes ah it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise lah but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast ah ya
ya
ya that's why
that test ah honestly I haven't experienced yet ah cause I only year two now ah but something I look forward to ah
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or err what you call the inspector lah so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into lah like that ah ya
ya hopefully ah mmhmm
not bad ah not bad ah
spend a lot of time playing game ah
oo shiok ah I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
mm so something ah
something to kill time also ah in secondary school you know
then for you eh your free time what you normally do ah
mmhmm
mm ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you eh cause like you know you are like
uh year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit ah
mm
mmhmm
oo
mm
so okay ah based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first ah cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see lah which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
so maybe you can make it to what uh Temasek poly uh floor ball team ah who knows ah
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive ah
know
see which one you like the most y'know
oh
today ah I just finished my
last paper you know today
uh got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
oh my goodness legit
so much to study
okay ah hopefully hopefully ah hopefully hopefully can pass ah
but then ah after the paper like
for what ah
it's for like
for my
infection ah or it's like how to say it's like a pimple lah you know in a sense and it bleeds ah so I have to go for appointment ah

advising on the surgery
like okay ah
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery ah cause like I'm only eighteen kan

cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk ah quite high risk ah
have to like what cut open that one put me on anaesthesia
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
uh pull a skin
so I cannot imagine ah a'ah
ah confirm painful sia legit

three doctors in the room ah then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound
then I like quite scared ah then they start pinching pinching the wound then a lot of like the

you know when you're like kay now

then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
for me ah I also procrastinate lah like you know I prioritize my err playing games over doing work ah my assignments ah
very close right then I'll start doing ah
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time ah you know because if
kan like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me what so I obviously have to start on doing ah
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over ah then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it ah you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle ah this issue of procrastination cause like
always ah since secondary school ah
always prioritise my games over the
mm wah
damn
ya it is hard lah but you know we must lah you know
it's very hard lah then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
ya group projects like that
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
wah
mm
mm
okay
me ah okay I have ah okay recently
social innovation project ah uh ya
I think combined with
uh different types of uh people from different courses ah so like
uh
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry ah
so equips you with this kind of skill lah but let me tell you something ah I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you ah
cause like err it's damn rabak I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like walao eh why why got so much workload ah ah I don't want do ah like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
ah
like this
ya
ah then okay okay this one ah it happen like
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal ah for our presentation slides
then these guys right
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate ah
then
oh then they say eh why like that we you the only malay just come lah then I say how can like that I holiday what hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
oh my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining ah keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
or like do some drawing design kan
ah alamak legit I tell you I don't want ah but it's okay lah
ya but overall I think it's a good experience lah
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together ah
and also ya it's good lah so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made uh okay you know for our project our aim right
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely kan
ah they are like damn lonely right
alamak why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use ah then we decided to come up with something interesting for them lah cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
uh our the depression app ah counter
Pikachu ah Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
kay so what's so special about this tab right
uh when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app kan they can uh what ah uh
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say uh how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
mm it's it's quite cool lah honestly
and also err
you can also prompt for
uh real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one uh what uh questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool lah ya
ya um and also for our app right uh we also put what ah
uh since like most of us like like to game ah like we
most um people like to game like they download apps for what
uh games right
for most people right then
ah our app introduces like some mini short games ah so you got heard of uh what kind of games ah err like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
ah Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games ah like also we put uh animal crossing ah concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
um
games for the user to play with ah which makes our app interesting ah
ya a lot of people ah
mm
ya so our app
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
ah
what ramen or some like cookie eh
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon ah which is I think quite cool ah so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to ah ya
forward to ya
so that's about it ah for my module interesting ah
mmhmm
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong uh
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two ah
ya semester two ah
it's called err
ah communicative I can't remember ah what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
uh improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach ah like one of them is ah time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance ah it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right kan do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what ah
what's that ah
oh your interview skills ah
for interview
he teach us uh the basic questionnaire ah like how to prep ourselves for interview
err what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so I think is quite that one ah manageable
ah
ya
ya
so I respect ah for doing that
y'know
like I always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people kan
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what this module is teaching ah
how to how to out
outstand ah among the other other interviewees ah
ya
so it's quite good lah since
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm then okay

and my course right the worst thing right is that people of my age right don't have you know like there was only one or two most of them were like two or three years older than me you know

it's kind of like a more singaporean Reddit kind of thing
have you still been using Reddit lately
vikings

thinking of buying what assassin's creed or
but
eh
but do you play the first few assassin's creed series
brotherhood I don't really remember playing eh no I don't think I finished brotherhood I played two
I think I was the one who told you to play two right was it

I don't know actually I don't know what around bugis is ah
ya never mind ah
I not interested anymore
I don't know
I think I need to translate this page ah

I don't think they were pirates or something lah I think you I think you
anyhow only ah
are you googling
are you googling uh malay pirates or something
uh huh
are you on the must share news dot com that one the seven facts about bugis people
why
ya ya ya there's something about pirates ah okay lah this page is in english so its a bit easier to
the boogeyman is out to get you
the the bugis man uh
that your ancestors were pirates ah
I don't know sia
uh huh
eh so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh
ya
sure sure
the spur of the moment that kind of thing eh
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think
huh
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first lah
ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya
uh huh
uh huh
oh
okay lah so anyway it's kind of like fated ah that you
weren't supposed to get that tattoo ah
or do you like keep it all from her
then her friend is like the party kind ah
oh
orh so they know what you are up to lah
are you gonna go mexico do you have any plans to go mexico soon

ah
uh huh
but you don't remember ah
ah
not like the hit up other girls kind of satan ah
mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah

like ya

okay lah all's good all is good so
how
um
err for me
I guess is like
okay lah lesser
customers
but
so it's so hard for people to no be able to listen then it's like I try to raise my voice but then I feel like
so how other than
work how else is the pandemic
ya lah rilek ah okay water break
but ya I think uh one of my pet peeves I guess is
kan like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
mm
you know
so it's just just from her face
like a gangster seh but then
okay uh were there other people that felt the same way as you
um
um
um
ah so like two face
just marker
I think uh
because
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
some of them are okay jer
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like ah
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
um if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
okay that one K K K okay that one case lah but like ya that one that one is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also oh okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday lah but straight away we report lah because it's like
just imagine if
um a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask oh why you talking to a minor and then just like
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
um
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know ah ya sia but then ya it depends on the situation but
ya
you going to get bitten
um
Maggi Maggi cup jer
which one is it the indomie one
karma wow
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard uh
okay lah I just google lah just now they have no menu so how ah
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
lek ah lek lek lek lek lek
uh it's just
because back then in school ah now I working full-time already lah ah so
uh I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me lah but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
ah secondary school
but ya because like oh my god first major exam so like you expect people to at least
just
but then well ah long story short
it's just a
when I
that night where err
whether now so
you know like those kind err high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
oh shit okay no no
and then
ya so after that
uh so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
his girlfriend is me then I was like who sia who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya but then then ah
um before me and the guy
err talk right
he like another girl and
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
err I talk to my best friend lah and say like oh why who who do you think spread and everything then she like ah I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday lah like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
ya that's true sia
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that oh I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like oh hi let me ask guy best friend first
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not lah
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you ah say I prefer
um
ya ya ya ya ya
um
ya but ah I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
ya
eh ya I want off topic sia but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back jurong lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
example
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge lah but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya mmhmm thanks
ya I guess um
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself lah not so bad lah for for anybody that you feel like
I guess
okay
mmhmm
in what sense
oh bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite lah but
but let's say
ah then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that kan um
um
um
mmhmm
ah ya my ex also did that
um
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
even
okay this one I cannot brain
women also the same what
I guess in a sense
um um
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that oh my god I was
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically
ya like very edgy in a sense
no lah you normal lah
yes
but then for her is just
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
err
and then after that
and then like oh how I wish I was in your group then I say oh ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
um ya precisely unless you're married lah that one I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single lah that's why we talk about this
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for lah you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming oh farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how ah
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
oh
wish
so explain your comfort characters um
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
oh that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example gizmo
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
okay then your other cats
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
you live with them what that's why I'm asking you
oh that's cute alah
oh damn
I see okay I see
mmhmm
what
ya
okay lah makes sense mmhmm
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
ah
ah okay lah at least um
dear you still have gizmo I know you you sure gizmo a lot
and and and
mmhmm ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
ah okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier wow the love ya
ah
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
ah kan
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay what at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
ah
how then the cat never fight back
ah that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
ah that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that one a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
oh
um
mmhmm
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya sial ah who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific eh
because you angry
what why wah so specific what you do sia
ya
ah mmhmm
uh huh
I don't I don't understand sia like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya mmhmm don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen zentiment
okay lah I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just ah strawberry generation lah all those kind of shit
but things are done what
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can lah the competition not that much
ya
mmhmm
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting lah so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay lah a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know or poly just ah tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very ah ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
um
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
uh huh so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten until one okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best lor so
you know they were like like what you said just now like oh I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then ah you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like err ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
ah from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years lah I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that oh you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical ah body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice oh especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but hmm that's it
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
ya
I mean it's not it's it won't affect
you know it's just
ya
ya and it's as long as you do your work you do your part that's fine you don't have to like oh because she got she got tattoo lah he he got piercings ah you know he got piercings on the eyebrow and then just like how is that distract you you just don't look ya that's it
ya but I just hope
how to say I guess our generation we have things to look out for right
ya
ya and hopefully all the other things happening will be great lah right right

okay how was your day
you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning kan
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning lah
mm
production meeting eh
prepare for the production meeting at the the details eh
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of COVID right ah
I see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause I need to prepare lunch
and I want to I think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you lah the
I don't I think for you is best to eat
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
why
ya
stretch the food even further the food we have lah
so I also don't want to waste food ah okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details ah
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing what
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
I have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done I mean I'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
err who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like eh that's not the famous song from tokyo square
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the tokyo square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it ah
so tokyo square actually that
it's not a a got a tokyo square concert but they perform a few songs ah
uh because there are many other things that err at that show so tokyo square was one of them so I I I remember tokyo square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word tokyo slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
to america right they don't have
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is sukiyaki ah from what I know
that's the that's the unique thing lah that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin I need you
put us somewhere then she brought me with her lah so I think one of that that's why she know tokyo square
uh
they had this show they had this
ah so you remember lah
mm
uh the open space then they put up err the stage right eh um but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like what
uh
sam willows
uh
is there a song baby jane eh
uh
four
ah
uh
uh
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese err medium right like the malay medium
err have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
uh on the side line lah it's like the a full time job for them
uh
I mean actually added actually actually them the I'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous what
ya
ah ya the malay medium lah but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like kit chan
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent lah like like the singapore talent ah
nuradi nuradi nuradi is a ah ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
astro eh
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this err
not fantastic lah not like ah zizan razak though
no I think
it's only people like ah zizan zizan eh
they are more exposure ya
the theater lah that the malaysia that we went to to watch the nadrah right
I remember when M nasir was talking to a
err hady eh hady mirza
for the
err what's the talent show eh
err M nasir so err hady mirza because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube lah I I I I watched through
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose lah
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think err err M nasir asked him err hady where have you been
because he was err wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work err
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem eh
like zoe tay and that time zoe tay was the were the in she was really the talent like pan ling ling
oh
her association
no I said if you want to go you can go with
no at that time lah
ah
pass away already eh
pass away eh
retired lah
how does it look like
oh
pointed out ah
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and um
I think that's the main reason why they retire
eh even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine oh for you you are millennial I'm not sia
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
uh I am a generation X leh
it's really the you lah but you are not the the the the people that seroja and borshak was saying lah
the they were saying that this millennials ah lazy you know lazy ah
ya
ah
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years eh twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even err make any profit
err around the same price as seroja
uh uh
uh
slightly more lah or around the same price lah
because she already bought a she already got err her flat
err her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love err cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach lah she doesn't have to
uh
ya lah but she has wonderful legs ah
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around uh ten years or so ah
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road eh
the amber road I'm not sure maybe ah
I think I I don't think is a new condo ah
uh uh
uh it's new it's new
uh
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
oh my god sex heaven
condo kan
it's very very nice
uh
because I thought I I thought she stayed at serangoon garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
uh uh
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
huh
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask lah
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
uh
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very err thrifty lah sia
rent eh
uh
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
mm
that's why she move uh
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo lah
uh
uh
uh
so they are a bit different lah their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
uh distinction lah uh
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so lah
uh
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best lah the best usually not them lah
uh I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace eh
she he ya
ya
he went to eton know that was his socialization tau
oh I uh my father owns a travel agent company
uh
uh and then
uh
uh huh
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
uh
this is doing you know
ah
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at eton so I was like eton then dasha was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to err the people in eton but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the eton boys err russian lah
eton is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
ah ya
uh
uh huh
by russia ah no uh but uh
ya and and and the thing is is not just uh it's not just vietnam but also uh indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
err study in russia because russia uh uh study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year ah to brush up on her russia before she
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america uh it's recognise lah
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when err kacha was telling me kacha the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to sarawak or sabah
uh
huh
money
ah
malaysia hospital recognize
uh
but she cannot come and work here
uh
uh rundy his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
ah
ah
ah ah
to send her daughter to australia
the pace of life is different lah
uh uh laid back
she told me that
aiyo kartini what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid I mean this is sofiani who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but I know
sofiani will find it very difficult to not care lah you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
I know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
you know ahmad ahmad stays here
ahmad was like when he switched to secular right
adi secular
ah same as ahmad right
oh
ya
strength
their strength is languages uh
ya
ya
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test leh
ya but we we found out from my
err university of
jordan and the university of
not cairo lah err al-azhar
al-azhar
al-azhar
uh it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
they don't consider a degree for al-azhar a degree
uh
don't know allahu aalam
uh
uh
ya
uh wani eh
unless they do online lah unless they do online lah but I don't know al-azhar now not that good lah
the system of learning ah
err I think ever since the the egyptian spring ah uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time lah we know that the story lah
oh now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
uh but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
err at the
uh
err visa at the jordianian embassy ah
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran lah you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the fusha
that's the that's the thing lah so they get whatever they can
uh they can throw that at your face
you know but that is the the the nature lah but then you want to get the sadat eh they call it sadat you you want to get sadat so you do that lah
let her just stay here lah let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
uh
language is a bit hard lah
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
uh
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength ah
uh I mean I have friends who who like for example murni and I have a mutual friend
err okay lah one of our girlfriends lah
so I'm not that close to her lah because
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
uh
err
what what what she mean actually she mean err

thursday
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no lah I mean
we went to kaplan to register her
oh different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging oh no you cannot then you have to go this
ah
ah
it's exam-based also lah I mean written written exam
how many choices she have
but
line kan must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses eh
ya I mean with this combination diploma
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam lah kan
no choice
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
now is december
mm
orh
but part time will be what how many years three years
orh
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
her
orh
ah
then she's no more ah means she's tertiary student what
hmm
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this one is uh this one the
ah bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
ya
mm
but I mean does it change if
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things lah kan whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
one more year one more the amount you have to pay on it ya
don't waste timing
I said to him can that one is your pastime not your professional time
that depends on his portfolio
mm
so
there's something to do with maths also in in in photography
think cannot pause is it have to talk all the way is it until end
wah there's twenty more minutes to talk next subject
speaking about SAM uh
maybe if you open for english the franchise fee
I don't know you need to find out lah kan
samuel
that uh
pick up a teacher just do for english then if the teacher say okay you willing to come this time this time this time or not ah then if everything okay then okay lah kan
cause if they use two classes that means no place for us to sit around already cause the class

ya my primary school okay lah more not a friend lah more of a classmate
uh ya whatsapp group
uh he was inside that group also and I never talk to him at all so
this was like in like primary five I think ya
ya
ya okay anyway
anyway
and then he corrected me seh
ya he corrected me and then he's like oh your english sucks
ya ya and then I left the group
ya I left the group cause
because of him lah to be honest and that was like rude what like I know lah like my english sucks at that time of point but you don't say that to a person
I don't know I I don't care
I have no idea I literally have no idea
ugh that's not the point
ah just just so rude but anyway
that incident made me want
ya made me want to brush my english ya
look at me now
ya
ya just now
we just ordered food actually I wanted to go out cause I didn't wanna stay at her place
oh by the way karisma didn't pass her driving
so what happen
uh huh
serious
me too
serious
but like before the test she look she looked confident to be honest ya
uh like she sounded confident lah ya right
eh
I think it's just the nerves ah
huh serious why
but she book already
then she should book
you already have motor just take the motor lah
okay lah actually no it's good
ya okay
auto
your head lah no need lah for what don't waste your money
you want you do ah your money right
ah then she's like she's sad she still talk about it
okay lah ya same I get the feeling
but it's okay I mean at least her instructor nice kan
her own instructor
ya
ah
ya
sort of but she but she applied for to teach
I don't know like after this english test then she will
teaching ah
this is diploma in teaching
ya diploma so she can only teach in primary school if I'm not wrong
obviously but speaking of that
ya I don't know how about you
industry
oh
oh so when what do you mean by food what manufacturing ah
like do you get
okay
food oh
oh
okay
chemistry
oh
I get it then so what could be your potential future careers with that degree
what would it be
mm mm mm
ya
mm mm mm mm
ya
I see but so interesting
ya
oh serious why
uh huh
oh
ya
uh huh
oh but why I thought she just got a full time job
I no no I don't understand I don't see the point
but it's just what she's suddenly passionate I mean like not passionate but interested or
exactly
options
okay that's true
ya ya
stick to one
okay lah hopefully
ya
but to be honest my degree also I'm also not so sure if I want ya
if I want to
ya stay or like continue finishing
huh
ya
why
alah this is why
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
ya
ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can
ya ya all through zoom
but quite sad lah like I want to go back
I mean even uni also is through zoom
and I don't to be honest I don't quite like it
ya
serious
oh
are you serious
ya I don't even attend
because okay
cause
ya and then I just skip that part I was like
exactly she's ya
eh
I don't know
but I think I think physical better ah
ya
mm
eh uh
both of us ah
no lah for what
dorm ya
ya but
I know but I don't think
ya
but I don't think she wants to stay at the dorm I think for us to be honest not worth it and if we have a car for what you want to stay at the dorm ya
ya so it makes sense what right ya
oh oh ya

cloudy is dark
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me lah

ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
in front of people
and then after that the
so
ya ya you were you were it
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay lah the word is forget ladies and gentlemen um
manufacturing
right no no no continue no no no ya
this was another traumatising part err on my end
I guess so ya I guess so
oh ya ah we were kids we were
just stop lah like whoa
ya but you know
right
hmm oh my god
forced that's the word
you know what I felt the same way about you
and
what
oh my god I remembered

ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him

shah rukh khan uh and then uh what's that some of the bollywood's
uh actors and actresses

uh the fee ah to go to go inside
and dive together swim together with the fish

ah both of you can what was that I can put on uh scuba diving uh I think I just
if you can really swim together with the sharks eh

mm
ah sea aquarium ah mm
that time you watch what what movie
at the bedok cinema
you cried
ah movie
wah
this one what ah japanese eh
oh japanese story but they what they voice into what
orh the subtitle orh how how many viewers
orh
ah
but then quite a sad story ah I I don't wish to watch that kind of story ah
uh can watch lah old people cannot watch lah
why why why not they um
uh what was that revive uh superman's life eh
if a old time uh superman eh I think I will watch ah
I I I I prefer superman other than any other Marvel
ah heroes ah
uh what was that uh superman uh
powerful character ah compared to other marvel heroes ah
mm
hulk also
eh
ah right
ah ah
so last time when I watch hulk eh last time eh uh series eh they no no no nothing
ah there was actual visual
I like uh I like the the series very much ah those days ah
superman uh hulk
ah
which to me it's it's not
really accept so much lah we prefer normal
I mean natural visuals ah
mm
ah sorry
okay lah I I also appreciate uh movies lah
those time also I watch true lies
uh what's that uh movies rambo also
uh but
arnold schwarzenegger uh rambo
ah sylvester stallone
uh I think these movies really make my day ah
and ah for me I like adventurous and not so violence ah
I like adventurous ah and then also
I like to watch fairy tales movie
uh as well like cinderella
snow white
uh I think
uh I I prefer to watch this this kind of fairy tales ah
uh
ah should be no problem ah kan
uh I I think uh
ah we can go there what
ah
I can try baby pool first ah
or you can try deep pool also what
ah I I I think I think we can try ah swimming
you can try your skills
no it's it's quite uh no uh wasted tau
if you you know how to swim you better use use your skills
correct not so this time round you can use the deep pool don't worry lah maybe can we we we we can try slowly
alright then after that you can uh sharpen up your your your your swimming your swimming skills
then after that we can go east coast
ah
so east coast you were to go deeper or you want to go to the shallow
uh and then how how uh and then how you get how you got the way how you run away
he carried you ah okay lah so so
oh but then
uh you sounded not okay lah but then end end up okay ah
okay lah should be no problem lah
so so so hopefully so uh you what's that in sec one sec two you you had
uh several
uh practices kan ah I think should be should be okay
ah
practice
ah
ah
so if you go to east coast maybe we can take a shallow one ah
ah slowly
ah so gradually we can we can really do lah correct or not
I mean it's a waste ah
you can uh we will just we we we we send you to go swimming
uh swimming courses and then after that end up
you cannot swim I mean you are afraid to swim ah
ah
bedok swimming pool
ah pity ya actually actually I want to try also
how to swim also
uh
it's not I'm scary it's not I I'm I'm too scared ah actually I also can practise also
ah
so so so I I I think I can I can practise if I practise I can better become better than you ah
ah
so be beside swimming what's your what's your other fear ah height height is it
oh okay
okay okay
even though it took uh long longer time for you to to complete the course
did someone help you along
so this I want to ask did anyone said ah ee ishraf don't don't take longer time ah you
ah was that you you spoil the whole course ah
okay thank you bye

for my boyfriend right it's like his
family don't know that he got boyfriend you know eh he got girl friend you know
uh uh
err I mean he's not keeping it secret he just never tell them lah I think he bit awkward to say
ya not he second child
uh uh
ya

mm mm
uh uh oh
mm mm
mm
oh
still okay I see
oh
mmhmm

there's some game game design or some like that okay ah so that means at least he has a
mm mm
oh because he said very expensive one and then he said
uh
very difficult or something like that
ya
is good it's good good ya
that's why
like
he is scared to take the risk lah
because of the cost and stuff

is it the same assignment that I have oh
oh yes yes yes um ya me too me too I was supposed to wake up at nine err eight thirty
ya eight thirty cause I want leave house at nine thirty right and then I woke up at nine and then I was like hmm what time is it I was like oh my god it's nine and then I didn't want to get out of bed
like it was so hard and then I was like okay lah and then suddenly you see take your time lah it's okay lah then you say really take your time
I was like did she just leave the house
ah
ah
mm
uh oh
ya oh my god that's really really far why why why
pity you oh ya she study
oh for ad hoc eh nice cool cool cool cool cool
school oh okay
oh for different department ah
oh then they will just photoshop people in the same group lah
eh she was at her
oh wait she is the
eh she is head ah
oh who is the vice head
oh yes yes yes yes oh my god
I like I was like trying to think who is the oh K K K yes yes yes
ya
ha ha does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
oh because they're not gonna do any physical okay
ah I see err no eh they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no lah I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
mm ya ya ya
oh
oh okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
mm do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
um like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like oh like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester lah
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I feel she was like ya
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys tau so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like oh my god there was a okay lah
you can just
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
come here looking for like eh it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of um Muzmatch and also like like half our deen right the app this dating apps but the half of our deen is
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our deen
I think half of my deen or half of our deen I can't remember and then um
she met this guy so like err he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
the I think because
half of our deen need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister um by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
mm
is it
I didn't know
oh okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was oh like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
um not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
um this interface to tell me okay ya
mm
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that oh my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say lah like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
eh do it leh let me be the why
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that uh
um quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
eh
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
I guess um
when you this is very superficial lah but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join um ad hoc and stuff like people already
say lah you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
what's like your ideal date
ya lah
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
mmhmm
mm
oh
mm mm
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
ah because
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
oh
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
ya
ha your date how long
um okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya oh let's go trekking then we see how lah
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
ya so sweet
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
oh no oh my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
they just went toilet and then they never come back
mm
ah
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is lah
ah I see
ghost
ya so that was this um they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
um on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so lah ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like um he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
mmhmm
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ah I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing um that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
show uh that day I just find it
ya and then err so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show ah cry
maybe just finding
kan
just you know
I mean at this oh love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
err ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
um they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality lah
mmhmm mmhmm
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
mm
mmhmm
mm mm
match making ah
um yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that one is it's kind of sad lah cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like ah you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
my batch mates tau I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya kan is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
err ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes hazimah
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
oh my
actually ya that's a good thing ah and I I've thought about this my answer is no lah I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
um to my sec four students uh here like um no actually is like oh uh
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
oh I'm proud to live in singapore err to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like oh K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
oh god
I saw I saw yes
about like oh like why did you not care about politics oh because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
um have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
uh like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me lah because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
um you uh
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
ya
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
uh huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
um
and then like talking about Mendaki system uh subsidies and stuff and like
prove that no chinese privilege ya
ya it's just um
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that oh you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
oh because oh like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like hijabi don't get to wear a hijab all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like oh we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights oh oh okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very um
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
oh my god like ya
ya I feel like recess week is ending kind of fast
no no no no don't say that by the time you said that suddenly it's sunday already
yes

that is nonsense
you can't say it
oh what what which do you like best

I already know mine but it doesn't live in the zoo

panda koala ah cute cute cute cute

I love cheetahs I love cheetahs for my entire life
yes
and I get by basing their cause there's like cheetah leopard yes
leopard yes yes yes
do you know that cheetahs don't roar do you know what sound cheetahs make
oh my god I would love to show you no they do not
they do they do make noises but
they do not call for kor kor
hold on ah
my favourite word sleep
I don't know eh dude there's one
no this is a full grown cheetah
the purr but it meow
and then they also make some okay you listen to the beginning right they actually make some other sound
ya them they make this sound
don't know
kan
like I
I love them so much I love cats any any kind of cats
ha ya they are all cats
they are so cute
like I want to meet a cheetah one day
oh
ya like why should they be in the cage
aduh
ya additional five dollars for the boat rides then I was like pe and then
not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like ha maybe cause like can go first
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but uh kai kai or jia jia whichever is the female one she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out lah she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think kai kai is the guy one kai kai was um
ah menopause ya
the jia jia was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
mm that is interesting I think mine is also on
shows that
ya
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying um
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
they are like
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like oh
my heart you just called me your husband
oh so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try lah like oh like do a live oh my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother oh okay lah then your friends then
I've never thought of it that way
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
kan and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling lah that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya so
inshallah
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay lah good luck to my sister then

hi
okay ya
what do you mean what happen today
oh okay so basically
huh
yes I did oh my god I'm exhausted but like did I not like I had don't think I got tell you but like a girl got her new MacBook today and then you are the first one I'm calling on my MacBook she's beautiful she's gorgeous
oh my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold one apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
orh
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
err
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like um
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
um
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so um
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story ah like since
um primary six
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that ah give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
hais neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name ah
so his name is #Adi#</P2
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is #Adi#</P2 something
ya I think
like it's a long name ah but let's just use a generic one ah then after that
so
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur sotong and all that all lah I don't know what I will do lah I cannot really remember
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk lah
then I will just never talk to the aunt even eh the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
then I was just like
huh
err I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
number one
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
how I cut my hair
ah the last time I went to an actual barber
ya so after I told huh
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
um
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like I don't know it seems like
yeah I even
ya lah it's not considered harassed lah that's true
but like
like how do they actually
judge you

my situation like I actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school I go to I don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
you know it's just weird that's just what I was thinking about lah

twenty seventeen ah
oh no

no wonder okay
oh
gap year
huh
chasing her
so she's still fickle-minded and then it's been two years and then she still doesn't know
maybe she still likes him but then why is she not getting together with him if she still likes him
ya but the funny thing is that I don't know kay I kind of get it if she like
still wants him back ah cause like it's her first what then like
I don't know lah okay like I've never been cheated on so I don't really know like now I can tell you like straight up like oh if he cheats on me I'm leaving his stupid ass but like
in that situation you never know what like
if you really love someone then
I don't know
huh
what
ah
mm
mm
Serangoon a'ah
okay
you're already late
confused
ee oh my god dude
oh my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
err one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really um I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
huh
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
like just touch wood lah imagine if you don't
have gotten together in the first place ah of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also #Saif#</P2 so
Rudy Aip what's up
okay cool
huh
what
what
huh
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
are they still together
to get out of jail
ah
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
oh ya sia like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
in but I would like
want him to tell me like hey we're gonna be in this for the long run lah
so okay so
um
there's this one friend of mine
like
um her name is Amy</P2
then like
ah
ah yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day eh this year and like we are gonna plan for it lah like they actually have a plan like a future Amy</P2 has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like Amy</P2 and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
um she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
oh I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things ah
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
ah
ya so the next time Russell</P2 asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if #Saif#</P2 texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
huh
ah ya that's why how to go drinking I ask #Russell#</P2 pay ah #Russell</P2 my daddy

mm
I don't know man I got no nothing against you but I just don't like making smoothies
at Ice Talk cause they only have two blenders and they're so loud
but like there's that this is the reason why but like everytime it's either blue coral
yeah
I never
I never actually tried oreo blended
before
like you know the typical like macam Boost or like some shit like that lah but like the actual like just oreo and milk
and blend
never
like throughout my childhood I never
yeah I did also
mm
Ice Talk they put creamer
creamer and sugar cause they ask you what sugar you want
how much sugar you want
but like shout out to Ice Talk
your freaking hazelnut milk tea is a solid that's that shit is a solid milk tea
other than that nah

KOI
KOI I never tried hazelnut milk tea from anywhere
so anything you put on top of that is nice
huh
ah ya ya ya ya ya
oh my god Gong Cha teas are solid their taro milk tea freaking solid bro
ah
what you drink
mm
yeah
ya cause any of the jelly comes with sugar what
why though
will you eat oh yeah you would I was going to ask you would you eat like the Cold Storage
I want to really badly
you wait until like seven o'clock eight o'clock when they cut
but like Sushi Deli isn't any cheaper though
when I went there like seriously
what is it and it's actually halal but it closed down but ya that one
ya fifty cents
ah
I should have taken everything
finish ah
I never
before Andalus I started in primary one so I think when I was like in kindergarten like for two years I was at
have you heard I think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
um
but okay so the only thing I don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that I remember oh my god I love my whole story is that right
I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
um
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
but like they went right
was like a family friend
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
ah then I was just like
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
you know
okay we cool after so much shit and then #Aisyah#</P2 story's is just not done okay then
my mum I guess
that
are you serious
can it be cured
oh my god
um
my god she's another #Wati#</P2
huh serious ah
like
like how did it go from
her to your mum so fast
can you imagine our batch having a reunion but okay cool but besides the point
but selected people or what
oh
that is not a reunion but okay kinda like okay
um
mm
some fucking vicious cycle right there
mm
mm
what
ya like why are you putting words into my mouth like what do you know
whether
or like what
so like ya in conclusion you really attract toxic girls
or friends I guess
okay that's a bad thing to say lah how are you supposed to make friends if you don't want to tell people
about
the things that bother you
but then really though like genuinely you really attract
really bad people but then we are friends so I don't know what am I saying about myself
I like
yeah
am I like your first stable friend
like the mentally stable like the one that is not about to burst into a bubble everytime
is #Ain#</P2
and Eileen</P2 not considered a stable friend
ten years later
ya tell her the tea that she's gonna get next is me sitting on Kahir#</P2>'s lap to beat the bitch up
to make
ya but there's that
but like it's okay
I'll be okay
I will forgive and forget girl girl
will not
succumb to being such a big bitch
I know right
it's so freaking fun
you know it's just like fuck
I don't know like motor is fun but I want a car
cause girl girl can drive and
you know safety and all
but like motor is fun
yes
bye bye baby
bye

it's so long since I've seen you
so how are you
oh really
how is it
oh
so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult lah because of the pandemic also it's like uh it's like very limited with the jobs so hmm
oh ah cashier job
oh that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend lah but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you lah your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like ah we got we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's uh like uh for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right oh really ah
as in she working oh
oh
ya eh she working as cashier also ah mm
um I think I got make like a few mistakes lah once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then ah you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money lah I mean ya then after that uh the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya lah we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need lah ya but so far never ah
oh ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty lah so apparently like I think I miscalculated leh then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay ah cause I think I was the one that did the mistake lah then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet lah
ya
oh my god
ah so nice luckily the uncle
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what lah but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
ah pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive lah also but also some of the customers like I think ah some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay lah the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much ah eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen sia imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what wah that one is like is like one week pay leh
oh ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name fadreena is it fadreena so you met her from right the try out
hmm
oh no okay wait so my friend ah I don't know if you know her lah is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend lah
so apparently she and the fadreena they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates lah so apparently uh my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then after that the few the next few days kan um the fadreena was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
then like ah the japan trip also like she was the fadreena was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also fadreena like I don't think you know her much lah but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other lah fadreena and my friend then because ah then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say uh I forgot what ah
very bad from then then ah oh ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend naziha right she said like the fadreena sent her a long long text
saying like um what ah why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago mah
so from then my from then on right my friend never talk to her because like obviously like they can they cannot click right so why would she talk to her right so ya and then suddenly like very recently she ask she just sent that long text ah of like why you talk behind my back then my friend also like huh I also never talk behind your back for what then also because she got like a boyfriend right I think I don't know is

I felt like from then on it was like a movie sia
huh uh
ya scary what else he can do sia

oh last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
uh no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us ah but he himself is not there
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
uh yeah
ya lah
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so uh we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A uh plan A we go we go Sentosa
the beach lah
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why ah
why sia
so weird
no so go Sentosa uh we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo eh
then ya
then uh we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like uh forty two dollars
or go
uh the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
uh the wax museum some Marvel
some Marvel
dah that's one for one you know means we can split into two lah
ya so split into two uh
one for one so two lah
yes
yeah
then uh that that wax museum uh
uh later ah but basically
basically uh those are our activities lah for the day
yeah then
after that uh they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
uh
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
mm
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
uh plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set uh we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage uh
we set up like a small
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage meh I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
ya
because there were other people lah that's the best we could find actually
obviously lah everyone will aim for that spot got shade what
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus ah this is our plan B
um
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya lah like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
uh on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
eh or is it more than two I don't know lah but
long enough lah
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor ah then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot ah
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot lah
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay oh wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late oh yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot lah he what
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got Shah Rukh Khan
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like oh yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class ah he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her lah uh whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class lah it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
Tampines ah
I think ah
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back Tampines he don't like to go back that house
no lah but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near Tampines hub there
so
no
near Tampines hub
yeah
yeah but ya lah he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in Sentosa
yeah
six last eh entry eh something like that
ya lah which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
err it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay jer
yeah
I give my opinions but you know uh eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend lah cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food lah estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock ah I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them ah
I was telling them uh I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
eh but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
uh they sell their specialty is what ah
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing lah okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay lah just go with the flow if cannot then cannot lah
we can just like
but like
very light food lah
cannot eat cannot eat I okay jer
um
hmm
uh eh mm
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan lah
um
then we talk about like other things lah
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say ah
I do a lot of things so
I'm like uh I think FaceTime better ah but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
Arshad
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah lah you know
those people
no those people lah
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
oh the thing is uh out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya lah
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no ah don't let me be the deciding factor ah
mm ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead lah
it's okay
then I say lah anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
uh I mean huh I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy lah but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with Humaira and marissa
yeah I realised that uh I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends lah I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also what
ya you see like like Ria
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
mm
it's okay lah
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know ah
so sad leh is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell what
no it's because I went there prominent lah
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
err towards the end towards the end ya lah third year
okay lah uh
I sorry ah but ya lah that's the difference between you and me lah I enjoy pe
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
uh red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money sia go in take photo
ya lah the vintage car
oh yes
oh ya I remember eating that with Humaira
I remember you were pregnant lah last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part lah
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride lah so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop what
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
uh
I got somemore drawing to do
oh ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email ah
need to find her email
mm
ya
ya lah anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about uh how
we were saying lah we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line lah I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants ah that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya err also because he knows himself better lah learnt from mistakes
he will take action
huh
I think a bit lah he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it lah
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling lah
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
mm
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what eh what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you uh it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage ah
yeah but you already bloomed dah
some someone lah
yes
ya
really
oh my god you all nerds
and the teacher never react meh
mm

you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test lah
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story
yes of course

but in secondary school I think I was just busy with my and upper sec is my
until seven plus eight

they never see ah I remember my friend
uh doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch lah why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
yes kiap the thing whatever you call it

crispy chicken okay
okay ah
okay
okay okay
um
ya
we can leave eleven
okay
for
orh
okay ah I mean
oh ya ya ya
um
wei then what what's your job as like advisor
ah
um
like the like exco member PERBAYU exco member need to have experience in like different ad hoc ya
so it's not not that bridging the gap kind of thing but more of like exposure for the exco member itself himself
ah
ya but
I don't know I mean you got say it's like a perks of
being exco member like
try
I mean I don't know
ya
oh
ah okay
but you sign up to be the
leader pe as in advisor leader pe
oh okay okay
ya but you have a choice to reject or accept pe
I mean
okay ah
um
oh I think it's clip though oh oh up up movie up
not really analyse lah but
um
ya I think okay macam like you need to incorporate your whatever theories that we learnt in class right just macam relate it to the movie
ya
is about err old people like elderly something like that ah
then
ya cause the the story is like
is is centered um centered on like this old guy pe ya so I guess that's how like my prof thinks that it is relevant
join ah
mm
oh ah ah ah
ah
so
so what's your what's your take on it
in the future but why is the future is now
mix
okay
okay
a lot of like
like on their especially in singapore like on their it will state
what race they are what
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
oh okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
err
like what's your point
uh huh
mm
like you say they shouldn't choose
oh
do you know that got some macam
ah
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
um probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
then they need indian pe and then that their open slot is only indian like macam that open open macam the empty house is only open to indians
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for ah indian
ya
ah
probably the same race
a'ah a'ah
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to macam some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying ah so it's like
um
uh
um
ya
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like um there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of ah like macam
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now ah
ah yes ah macam
ya so to a certain extent I guess like it's justified but did you know that macam this um
racial enclaves
ya
ya true lah true
ya and also macam there's a lot of like um
I mean this is what I learnt ah um
ah there's like two different kind of macam
considered private housing pe so they like they have um
actually not dorm more like rental rental places so like they can choose their roommates kind of thing then
like those big houses kan it's like that's the
yes
um
I think
condo
maybe condo okay I have a like macam a dream house that
is
but not but
eh
west okay
oh
okay
okay okay I think I
ah ah ah okay okay okay
ya
door
oh
mm
okay
ya um
is it nice
oh I mean studio pe
ah
ah
ya everything is also complete up there
ah
okay
mm
mm I don't know macam I mean if
ya
um
ya
mm okay
mm
orh okay

ika
like do you still talk to her

then I'm like okay ah whatever ah
a'ah it's like eh ah
ah black dark dark
okay
okay ah
um
eh but okay you know my previous like shift
which was on
oh my god so many like rude callers sia
ya like
okay like like I call them
then we ask if like they interested and like I'd say all those things blah blah blah then I say like sir does this sounds
like something you'd be interested in then they say oh no no I'm not interested sorry bye
do you mind if I send you an email so that incase you change your mind
intercom for what
oh
um
oh okay
oh okay okay
oh by the way like that one is like if you have another helmet
ah
ya ya ya
ya
ya we we rode together
but eh but irfan
oh irfan was your pillion kan
okay okay
oh my god now I'm like thinking about
ah it was like a
like what did we eat at that time
a'ah a'ah a'ah
ya what
ah
eww my god
oh net
okay okay
um oh my god
okay ah do okay I will help you
about um
it's like you want you want to study first but then your parents like ah stressing you to marry go marry your boyfriend something like that but then you say ah like the main character better
dah ah I have to proofread that
like don't want ah I want to study first cause like not stable blah blah yeah it's it is an easy read ah
mm
ya
ah ah ah
ah
ah
okay yes
mm
ya but it has to make sense ah cause
ah it will be judge seh
they won't ask you ah but then like
if they don't understand then they will just judge you down pe ya
as in but at the same time
um is related
to
eh but you have to post on Instagram you know like as a post cause it's a it's a video it's a video
ee
ya legit
ya I think cause it's like so macam
I say I'm supposed to I I will email tonight as in not tonight this morning
then I forgot shit
I mean just send ah
like not I mean I don't know ah it's like normal pe
ya eh did you have you seen the prize
capitaland vouchers seh
first prize fifty dollars second prize forty then um third prize
thirty ah
ya so
honestly yes
if there is only three submissions you'll is like there's only three submissions you will get
something one like you get away like as in get
you will leave with something ah
ya
so
oi
mm
a'ah ah and
eh
okay okay okay
I think irfan ah
ya and also um the past ah it's very relatable
to I guess us
skim
ah
okay okay
ah okay ah that's all lah
dah okay bye

ya got it already
technically
I complete four hundred hours lah around wednesday but I stretch over
I took half day half day
ah
ya alamak
mm two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
kobe
I don't know
uh it's not project um it's just basically more case management
what I did lah for my previous job
we do lah same around the same lah it's more intense cause
err it's residential areas so it residential not institution lah
ah
I don't know if I want to say
okay lah
I don't know
the um from the office my my office there lah so
ah
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be lah
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay lah
but ya
finally somewhere I go is near my house
like at least at least ah fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
um not
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
ya
mm mm
ya ya no issues lah ya I think
I would say that she overrides him
ya ya I know
err oh last time
err the assistant director did this err blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask ah then
um ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in lah
ya
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
mm
I guess so good and bad lah
like what is it there's no bad impact lah on the client at the end of the day ah
like ya but
but at different locations ah under different program
mm mm
I think
in the social service ya
ah then it's also under so previously my previous job um they are the funders ya
so err
how to say
err fast and err presentable results
that's your
it's considered private affairs what uh
so in the end you have to get consent from them
they cannot
then
ya and then ya that's why
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
ya
ya correct correct
ya
supposed to
supposed to ya
uh no no
um you have to record down ah
and I was like
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then ah
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference lah because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
uh people I think can't remember where
ah so I don't know lah what's going on
uh ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty lah
ya cause I just
uh like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay uh
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move lah
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying lah I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
um
like
I went to psychology then social work then after that like should I try something else
uh huh

I think ya

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

okay I'm recording now
ya
I don't know
ghost
I can do that
oh safari and then
ya
this one uh huh
single
okay okay hmm okay
okay
I'm I not supposed to speak in malay

I will want to have money

so like there's a lot of red lines
no mine is like blue blue blue then if I talk really loud or I my laugh then got red
colour oh really ah
I don't know

I don't know I don't know lah I just feel he racist ah ya sia
we like gossiping but he really like like I don't know maybe he just like
he is but then I think something happen with the girlfriend or the ex girlfriend or some
shit like that I don't know I don't care
who oh really
how how did you know she unfollowed you
why would you even do that if you're my friend you would have unfollowed
I don't think so

ah ya
no but I don't want plaza singapura
I I don't really wanna work at plaza singapura
oh eh who knows not who knows you're mix then you look more chinese that ang moh
pakistani
oh didn't pop the bubble
like ask ah like the great old city they want people
converse
all is like given ah
I will be so early there nothing to do
right that's why I need
the job
sixty dollars no I cannot I I cannot I'm saving that money to book the to activate my account back like for my grab stuff E P
I mean like that is what I have been doing
I mean like it works for a little while I mean like it works like when I had
the K S P money the government money the government grant it work lah I keep my
my money all there
is like I don't think I want to show my face lah you know the korean pictures like the
should I put my phone here
I mean I don't think I want my legs
like this
I am
okay
I don't I don't want a lot of greens actually
not really like maybe like see the
or something like
I don't need to be full lah
I just wanna like because I don't have make up
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
is it okay duh
oh okay maybe nearer ya
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay
so funny
okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
oh look like
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
oh
okay
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
but you can learn ah it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it sia no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much um you edit ah
the higher your
your saturation err contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of um effect and then like the effect you put how high it is ah technically
kan and that's what my photographer friend said ah and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
oh is my card with you
okay
mm
ya same as you right
oh
eh but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take what
like if I end before eleven forty five
mm
but will that minus off like my pay
oh okay that is nice
mmhmm
it just enough time for me to take home lah
so like can I have to go back to orchard
oh oh the stop the bus
then I stop at dhoby ghaut
ah
uh huh
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
brams no
no no it's a it's a K drama about like classic music classical music mm
no actually K dramas ah korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
hmm
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart ryeo I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart ryeo was more than twenty episode I think
oh my god it was so good kan then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then ee
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood lah because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something ah can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
that is the thing
kan oh ya I saw
drama the goals are eh like meh
oh you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know ah

staycation thingy ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for wah wah wet
ya and I want to go wah wah wet
ya but if you book you get free sia
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap ah actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
you didn't have like toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds

ya sia I mean like the most we can get is two point two I mean like that's the standard diploma
salary I think
true but you have to work lah
why not you rent your at your brother's house

to have err
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay lah let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
oh my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
mm ah okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
ah alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my err future lah
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
ah be a professional sports player
okay
uh huh
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer lah cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
err but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
ah so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money lah
ah
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific lah but
Singapore soccer is a no no lah
all macam haziq
ah that's a bit unrealistic the passion is uh actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of err
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life lah
ah
alright
sorry
ah true true Malaysia pay better
um
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower ah
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport ah
anywhere and everywhere
wah so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late lah I don't want to be late lah
ya so for example ah
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
mm
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching ah
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about lah
ah
it is an emotional story
um sad
but
no it's a series series
mm but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
hmm
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
oh
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class ah in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well err in primary school
ah because
um
how to say eh
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no lah I mean that that's the problem ah because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have err you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
ah play soccer at the void deck all lah so
I will change my mindset lah but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this ah cliche phrase
it's true ah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example ah that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like wah
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song ah kan maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
ah
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders ah basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start eh you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song ah
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because ah there was this video playing that song ah so like oh not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K ah I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like oh ya eh nice song nice song ah
so it's damn annoying ah actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the lah
okay lah okay lah we cannot throw shades lah okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
mm
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
um
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries ah will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
mm
ya
precisely
mm mm mm
that's a sensitive uh topic
okay
let's see next question eh
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do mm very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds lah
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
um rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need ah okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and ah okay basically iphone is good lah those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
um shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at pasar malam
and then
shoe uh twenty thousand lah
you know ah Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
ah bought a very expensive car lah
uh so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like eh you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like oh okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money lah
you want to show off
and all
give me their money lah I can put to better use
okay oh yes sorry
mm
uh
but people just live to complicate it
ah
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face lah
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do lah right
alright next question
oh this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours oh my god
oh my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say ah everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different lah
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like eh so there's now two shops eh
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food lah outside food the look is so important
mm mm
and
mm
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got ah
hopefully
oh you know what I just want to come lah
um next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
err oh okay okay oh okay okay
okay hmm
oh okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone eh sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
mm
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face ah
okay I wouldn't say expert because
err I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right lah
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on lah it was like what blonde
then I was like
ah see ah this one ah
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit ah
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
ah the
eh don't do this lah
you know what I mean you are like come on lah you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but kena our
you wanna get expelled is it
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
um okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
um
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
um
can ah but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is err
skill eh
maths
ah I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths ah maths ah like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of uh discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me ah
ah
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
mm
mm mm
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good lah they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
alamak cannot search ah
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning lah
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events oh basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny lah okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding ah a serious scolding ah
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
ah
I mean
it's hard lah it's hard
yeah
damn but
oh my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss lah definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it lah eh let's not throw shade to people lah eh
but oh my god I miss our class with
uh ham boy
S&W
uh
you only spend time when ah
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you lah
like that we really sit down and talk
ah
ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was ah
ah
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time lah
ah
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
um graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay lah
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
err
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
ah
and I have better options ah I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do ah to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that what you know what I mean
like giving
so
true lah true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free ah
cause I'm laying low a bit
ah I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things lah in the future
mm so you can actually come down
three more right
mm
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
huh
fifteen minutes fifteen ah serious expressway
mm mm mm mm mm in Singapore you wanna rev come on lah
you throttle abit beep
kena fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
um
let me think ah
it it seems good right
oh
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one lah
what happened
oh your wifi seems abit bad lah eh
okay lah I think we go next question ah it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves lah ah not to other people lah
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that lah this I guess this my fate lah
so if
in the past yeah fit body now ah
whatever god give me I'll take lah
like uh whatever it is lah good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again lah
like know because
ah but oh my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body lah like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot eh
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying lah because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team eh
the best is usually the fastest
ah but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst ah offensively
ah
so
but I have to keep up with those uh because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not um
used to it ah like I'm not exposed to it what
ah
mm mm mm mm yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal eh
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house lah because free what
right
oh chicken rice for the win bro
funny ah you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore chey
oh I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
ah
kampung chicken they make sure it's from a
not say kampung lah but you know kampung means they bring it up naturally
ah it it it you don't have to worry about the
others lah
uh
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival what the basic survival need
eh
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe ah I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya wah I mean
true lah true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
uh system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict ah
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
ah
correct
mmhmm
um
wah
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
um
like uh
only for pioneer generation lah
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
ah
must use the ah reservation booking
yeah
uh whether they have space or not and but come on ah
the
this is the problem right find solution lah
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who ah
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is lah ah
so we just have to take care of ourselves lah that's why you know ah like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot ah like
actually we don't have to go out always
ah but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay lah you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
ah
correct
ah
ya because K want to lepak okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
ah
it is prone to have problems
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay lah
nothing much
ah
no
mmhmm
seriously
then later when the number of cases spike then everyone panic so
no comments lah this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be lah eh
we don't have much say but
okay lah I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people lah
but
ah
I don't appreciate it
seriously firework is overrated for me
like
okay
I could just create this using my computer
you know what I mean
but I it it's just me lah I don't appreciate it lah I appreciate doing I'm all for doing kind of than seeing kind of guy
like you bring me to the most beautiful country with the best place to sightsee I would appreciate
like you bring me to a country with the best theme park I would go
ah
correct correct
okay that's different lah that's different lah bali nah
nah
but normal normal asia bro it's europe
or south america bro
okay lah if you talk realistically ah you want to go to europe also you have to go to the europe safe country lah Turkey
ya
they they handled the situation quite well
based on what I heard lah because you see ah like
U ah they are very big hit
ah so it's quite worrisome to go there ah
mm
greenland
no
mm mm mm mm
is it greenland or iceland ah that has no army
don't have army yeah one one one of this wait also one of this country don't have mosquito
I think it's greenland
because you see ah it's so err
precisely greenland got ice iceland is green
legit ah
oh oh oh oh oh
oh okay
mm
mm why
I don't know why didn't you apply for it
but it is still available ah still available lah
go for it bro go for it bro
in times of crisis we need
if you can get if you need help we have to
get whatever we can lah
but don't beg
yeah
ah yes yes yes

mm
yes

yes
yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya
understand understand
ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya

okay

okay okay
mm
okay
why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
ah but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot uh apply for your own home you cannot invest
ah but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home what no meh not true eh is it oh I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
oo
oo okay okay explain to me
uh huh
ya
ya ya that's what I thought
ya
okay
is it
oo
uh huh
uh huh
oo
if I don't pay my utility bills will they take away my house
oh shit oh my I still have my house lah it's just that I have no electricity okay okay

so you can still but how are you going to have the money to travel when you are bankrupt
but but like they will take away your assets kan don't they take away some of your assets how does it work

correct correct
okay
mmhmm
okay
I don't buy under my name
uh huh
uh huh okay
oo but wouldn't they be able to trace
because just because it's not under my name lah so if it's so so the thing is that if if let's say all these things are under my name then they can pull it away they can take it away
ah I see
mm
ya ya ya ya
ah
mm
ah I see
oo I see but then what happens to the amount that I mean cannot recover the the the amount eh

so so it's not that you cannot get a job it's just that the jobs that you uh ah able to get are limited lah certain industries ah
mm
ah I see
ya ya ya I see I see okay okay
the system lah ya lah that's true
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
so technically
damn
damn
oh my gosh
ya
mm
mm
correct correct correct
oh shit man ya I get oh wah like that lah I tell you your finances are going to be
I see I see
okay
two more minutes
ah
ah

school is fine but it is very boring um because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
Y-
like from other courses kan
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
go eat together
then when your school start
true
mm ya
mm
mm
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
uh in the because we have like college west
east right
and then err west and east they don't
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
um
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like uh
tests we take tests we take uh we do assignments we do uh
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade lah like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
um
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
uh like
ah I talk about like first
ah seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life lah
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood ah that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
um
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online jer lah but then it's very complicated because like
uh what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
uh mental uh mental disabilities is
a lot to that
and then
um minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then ah like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like err after finishing exam right
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
so it's just but I just want to sleep
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like oh my god we just stay in the first semester why ah why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
mm
mm
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
uh
mm
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
uh
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
uh
how you
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
how you
but then I find it very like
even
like
it's better if you can finish earlier kan in a sense but then
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand lah
because he is the type of person that think very like
oh he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
then after that
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more lah a lot of like opportunities for students
our class is my class it's very competitive like
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like uh
like secondary school
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
it will be like very like easy right
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
uh
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like oh okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
oh my god
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
damn
this is gonna be hard and then ah I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
not a lot of paths for you to go
you know that
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
uh for a few years and like
cause that's what I want to learn what since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity kan I just want to go for like child psychology
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking lah we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like ah you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter kan
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
that is the shock and then I think
go to poly after
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
like ego is what
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I uh sleeping
it's a good day but then it's like
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least eh there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like ugh
older and more responsibility in a sense
and then ah one of
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
I would choose studies lah if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you uh I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated ah she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
kan
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and aqil are going there for
err early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but hada don't want to go
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
mm
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
mmhmm it's like
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
like like
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like ugh and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say ah
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes lah
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time lah but then like then you realise at the end already right
how I am
you have a lot of happiness in you
because my friends say you number one when you break up eh
like that's not good
it's but ah then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID kan
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even raziq sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january imelda is different from
september imelda now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
you know that kind of thing
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is raziq
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually ah I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
checks up on our like
uh she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
uh
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
in a sense lah
cause
ah
we just like uh
cause
but ah same to me ah
mm cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down

okay can you hear me
okay okay can start talking already
ya
don't know you you are the one who was who is confused ah there's a cake on top of the macarons

ah ah
cut
ah ah lah

eh hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
mm
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
oh okay
ten gigabyte kan per month okay
oh
ya ya
uh
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years eh but I think you just bought kan iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade eh
oh still iphone lah
oh but I think recently you bought kan a new phone
oh
ya
unless you have wifi lah at home you already have wifi kan or
ya
ya
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition ah I don't think so
let me check
there's no more ah sorry they don't sell anymore ah iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven lah so I think for camera wise if you love the camera kan take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough ah iphone eleven uh
not too sure ah cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven ah
ya alamak
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off ah
I'm not really looking to job search yet ah cause I'm doing freelance ah so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year lah I try to finish this projects and without expecting much lah I think I think the most important thing is experience ah and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working ah I'm more prepared ah prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard ah because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test ah they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills ah you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
ah ya
and they will ask you like on the spot lah like how do you solve this ah ah this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem lah I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is uh that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them lah
ya
it's more mostly interview skills lah that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
ah monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast ah mm
the expected
oh
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you lah
oh
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
oh okay okay
ya
ya
ya
oh
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh
oh okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
ah the
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm
mmhmm
microsoft office ah
okay okay
oh ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed ah
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is uh I think
oh
mm
ya over work ah
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding kan they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable lah you can still read the code ah like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
oh okay okay eh never heard before eh
even though I am a computer science
C hash eh
I think it's called C sharp ah
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before lah during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know lah this kind of
mostly low level lah like C sharp python eh sorry C sharp uh what is it called ah ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable ah than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing ah more structured
ya

ya very interesting
ya I think like imagine like walking ah
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab kan
why
access to shopping mall eh is it

oh ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally ah I'm not too sure ah there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before ah I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
mm
ya
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home

but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible lah just that location wise is a bit some ah some ya ya true ah some some ah some might be insecure a bit ah like
to be in track kan
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
ya definitely ah bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running ah it will still run ya because it need to keep checking kan
I'm not too sure ah I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise ah so I think they need like support of
I think so ah I think it's just the bluetooth ah like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device kan
ya this is not this is not easy ah because because I think they still updates ah they're still updating they are still improving
for apple kan and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone kan
Google

the microphone is how far
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ah there's something
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
like
ya amazon products

mmhmm
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure ah like they have their own ya they have their own brand ah I'm not not sure what brand is that ah
maybe maybe they collaborate hmm
I think there might be lah not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house ah like or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
ah pedal pedal ya so they have to use
uh our hand lah our hand to press the button
ya
paya lebar ya I saw I went to paya lebar
oh
ya ya
mm
oh ya ya ya

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like
mm
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets ah the other two is for my other friend

and then
um he give you his card
and that card is a black card
okay is it his link card is black colour so no no no no no

love island
err
there is this show about
I just watch actually the other day um
the other lady
mm
they adopt adopt children
did you watch that

it's like too fast
but towards the ends ah very very actually very sweet
I don't know why I force myself to watch that
I'm like literally sitting down waiting to go to work then in the end I went to work late plus I was watching this
I don't know
oh eh when is your exams ah
mm how is school
what do you mean by normal
eh speaking of which
actually I have school sorry if I'm like cutting you off
I know I'm like a tricksy
I'm just going to take you out ah
K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
err ya
ya have to really think about it ya cause you invest in time as well
mm
ya no no because the thing is because of this whole economic downturn
K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm of course ah but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm
no like just diploma first
of course
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
because if you are talking about money yes I'm I have the job base
it's paying okay
just okay
and plus I can always pay pay installment yes malay people like installment
this is going to be
but no no uh of course obviously it's like school fees you pay installment what so
not that I don't want to move back with you guys but I'm so comfortable staying alone
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes on top of that you have add the the fact that you have to spare your time
yes I get that what the hell is this
wet tissue face mask
ah listen you are already what
nineteen bitch
I said bitch
why
won't it be exciting
treat it as a hobby lah instead
can
ya I know I know yes I like to be driven as well I don't like to drive people but the whole idea of like getting a license is like interesting
which will have to carry on

no because I've
I have travel all across europe not all across lah like maybe the western eh no eastern side of europe I remember it cheaper
like above
what was that the
the know not not not not not I won't said poor lah but that ya ya the eastern side of europe we should have a poor countries of europe everything there is cheaper right above france
ya not in france itself but ya the it is uh ya eastern side of europe
things are cheaper there
cause I was speaking to someone just now and then he was like
ya it's cheaper there but I haven't been there so I took the euro rail
ish ya

so I went from all the way from
a train ride all the way down to sicily france everywhere ah basically almost everywhere

everyone muslim is following him ah
so everyone muslim is doing the stock then I was like eh this whole stock is not really halal you know
but anyway so I'm just going to see how it goes
ah ya speaking of which um hobby yes
sewing I thought of getting a sewing machine
like soon
I actually plan to go down to gain or like gain city or challenger
I want to start stitching my own clothes

eh you know what I can incorporate you know why cause I was actually thinking of you know
um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces
I was actually thinking of incorporating that
into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that

some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place

it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no lah I watched until the end lah eh no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya lah like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya lah because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious what
uh huh
oh is it
mm
oh is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
mmhmm
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard ah the standard ya no the standard lah because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes what
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line lah
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven eh
ya I don't know ah that one also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor

which contains like vitamin A or something ah I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle err severe cases
mmhmm cystic acne
oh that one I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like ah I'm on I'm on tight budget seh
but they they only accept cash ah they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator
why
ya
but this one also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this one is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
ya lah
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this

half a year I thought that I dropped out you know until like half a year later I talk to him about it then he say ee no that you didn't
ya I thought I dropped out
cause the the way the my mentor said to me was
like you don't have to come anymore I was like as if I dropped out ah but he she didn't tell me that my dad called them to just pull me out of the course
whatever lah
mummy but it's okay I have no regrets honestly

clap ah
okay start
is our first time sia I quite nervous I'm so nervous
okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay err just now we had our chinese lesson
so um like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice lah we really tried to find a place kan ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the err sungei buloh
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
oh
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
oh
oh what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like wah in my heart eh is like like bursting tau ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time err he was a bit down and like err demotivated kan
so when I like I heard him singing then wah like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like oh my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week ah ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya lah so they were encouraging him to sing more lah cause they were happy that he's happy then err he even he was like err cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is rex he's a filipino guy
so he was like rex I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember ah all these names ya so ya lah so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing um I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
err what did I have for lunch ah oh ya because I was talking to haziq until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one eh eh no ya around one eh no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
mm true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars nasi lemak at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like err but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then err the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
oh ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about um just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya choa chu kang
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't oh okay I remember I went to oh cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like um it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this one is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it lah so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in choa chu kang doesn't have a shower
later like what time
err the burger err I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what ah I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella eh no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom eh the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know ah it's just like I I like it that way ah
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in

oh wow that's interesting um so why did you guys want to go there
mm oh ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
oh and that's enough for him
mm
mm oh ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear

nasi ah sorry I ate the lor mai kai then I ate the then I order three siew mai

that is a very is hyorin right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
mm
oh damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how oh chey
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy oh
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor kan but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
mm wow that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay um do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
mm stereotypes ah
ya I get what you mean ah ya is a bit err a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that one it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is oh you malay ah you in uni ah oh so you are one of the what ah a smart malay ah they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before lah but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya lah I know I know recently also like especially during um the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so err aiya don't know lah I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like oh okay okay okay but ya like like quite sian ah to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that err everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say lah
he's on what on the ship oh
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for um youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths ah
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up lah because err even though to me lah like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe lah inshallah like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did ah I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to err and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know ah like I just cannot cannot handle it lah ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like oh don't worry lah I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is lah ya cause err one of the mentors was telling me that like err he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
oh damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
ah ah okay let's look for one more question mm
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free eh
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing what right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that um analogy lah ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more lah ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that lah
ya oh my god my throat
hey oh ya okay then for me what was the question again ah
um my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free eh food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer um if something was free ah can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya lah like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya wah it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored leh if I were immortal
no oh my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy ah okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just um and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them lah basically
aesthetics ya sia okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift hmm will the werewolf be the shape shifting one maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to um the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then um I don't know would you rather be like

okay K
so like
and after that
so actually she was he was
behind
and after that like then after that
so when her ya then ya
like like is he okay
then after that err she own a shop like after she was like okay that she have a eyesight back ah
then after that when
he she fell in love with ah
ya it was like really funny but it's like so sad I don't know to me is like sad
but the ending
ya then he was like are you crazy like wow I kept sobbing you know like going out the cinema then everyone was like laughing at me
then I'm like oh my god I cannot sia
you know that then how about like your favourite show like that
hey they removed already
the girls as in like you know ah
cool what actually that's a good movie it's a good show
but then as they grow older like they become more like social
mm
a'ah
ya that's true that's really
mm
mm
ah ah ah a'ah
ah like cannot fit in doesn't look who can
mm
wah that's a good
that's a good show
serious
no what
what
there's like
mm
there's
okay lah
wah
oh that's a good a'ah seh cool
and then ya cause of the circuit breaker you know cause of the circuit breaker lah I don't know why like I suddenly like got like interested and I still remember like few years ago was like I'm not going to like
get into this K pop style of thing it's like
I will not then after that suddenly like this year look at me now

you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can eh as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty ah
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can ah
ya

worst student
chey no lah
you guys got that far distance relationship going on
I don't know but what the other always like say that
like you guys just seem very close
ya meaningless right

mm
so how did the anime help though
mm
oh that's cool
oh my god
this is like toy story
like tiny people like just random people
that's cool
err
okay like I I retook
O level art like
so I took O O level art two times ah the first time like I did it then I took it again in secondary five
uh so there was two time like the first one was like achieve it to my
grandfather who passed away
ya
so that was quite like close to my heart lah
like mm oh my god I'm gonna cry like err I incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit lah like he always like offered me
he
ya so
and also err
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like uh our expressions were like sad lah to show
and for the sofa pillows kan like
uh
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that uh I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like uh apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took uh O level art um it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork ah it was it was like mostly about my hair lah about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like uh previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
uh for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot
also I I I I joined a art competition like my school's art competition lah like it's being held from
like err err
like sketch club ah
so ya
ya for sure and I've been lazy
true true
yes
just high ah
true true
ya
like content heavy kan
true true
ya
just polytechnic life
so what are you planning to do for your future
mm
I see
I see
actually ya
ya I'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy lah
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like err
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university lah
then uh let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool lah
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work orh
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
mm
because the pay for it is
still
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave kan
ya
like
true
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive seh
true
ya
but that's so bad lah obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens
mm
true
true true
mmhmm
what
mmhmm
mm
but I'm shook
but I'm shook at the fact that he go Zoom call at the staircase like out of all places
mm
true true
mm
true true
a lot of now is also like they carry out using Zoom Zoom calls
you know
but that's so boring though
but okay lah at least something you know compared to like nothing at all
confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
okay lah that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school
like I
why why
uh
I know but like maybe ah maybe that's part of it ah but it's not like entirely him right it's not like I want to like have a farm with him or what sia like but I genuinely just want a farm
like I want to be rural
then like just vibing
you know
no I'm so shy
no
no
ya
true
oh actually true
but I don't think they do it on top of housing though
oh ya I guess so
you don't even eat vegetable like you don't eat your vegetables at all
ee
ee
that's another you
it's good ada vitamin dia semua
alright see I'm a genius
I need to tell that to my grandmother
but I hate mutton taste
I hate mutton it smells like shit
ya I like vegetable
why
oh you god yes
mmhmm
mm
mm that's cool
oo
oh my god
oh
to buy
to buy
yes
ya true
thick
like your thighs
mm
ya
a'ah
really
video
mm
mm
oh ah
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
ugh uh is this a question
oh okay okay ah change the world I don't know oh my god I want to be more environment friendly oh my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like uh
like I join ah then I went to this
this uh
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like oh it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like uh
stands for bring your own bag like uh
they held this thing like uh we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that err we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then um we will take out those uh which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then uh we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags ah so it was quite so it's a
uh then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption lah
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
to
like
like they implement like certain things ah to make it better
like I think the like pulau semakau like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast ah then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
so that's cool
why
and I never ask for plastic bag I bring my own bag
when
I'm so proud of
yes
change the world
yes just like how michael jackson sang it
change the world

ya so he has a store
to sell mask
err
before that he was err after
then after that they do safety for the week
ya so ya lor so that's pretty much he he does lah
totally ya we talk and talk and talk and talk and talk
then um
we
so ya lah we were there
ya we went there then after that
eh alamak closed closed then we went to err the
it's
ya ya ya ya there's one standalone stall
I don't know man I just there like okay lah
err
ya put aside lah it was
ya ya
ya wasn't so enjoyable because I was like ah shit you know so much so that
so same P one
my daughter also now P one
err maybe one day we can ask him over lah
to our daughter
pass away who pass away
that was like many many many years ago right
ya err family eh
ya
so
ya lah
punggol punggol
I don't know like how many like
you know quota something like that lah but apparently
he
I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan
oh
you you you
know he has been sleeping late because ya every ya every night I come back
uh the light will be on not how
so I just
okay
okay
eh
so ya so probably what the art ground so think lunch at home lah ya probably lunch at home
I don't know that
oo okay
discovered ah
so I no no more already ah I did I did buy something like for myself some potato chips I think potato chips yes
then there is chocolate also we got chocolate right
snickers at the end I never I haven't tried
um
no
mm hmm
need to book what where where where where's that
where's the place ah jurong west ah
jurong west where
I don't know I don't know
I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya
oh
oh
the
okay
then his shoes his black shoes how ah
this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know
right
never use lah that shoes
ask him to use but I think that that his black shoes still can use eh
but I I ask him to eh never wear this shoes what he says what
ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor
then no answer already
so ya
mm
ya but I've been keeping it and not wearing it also so it's
no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like
so I'm wearing err a nine point five but that one was a ten
eh
big big because different ah I think the cutting different certain shoes like like my Jordan I'm wearing nine but certain shoes I wear nine and a half
but
what I do right now buy shoes online right I would like go and try first
try first and after that
ya try
so this is my first time lah
okay
yes
still recording
oh okay so it's like
oh okay so it's like half an hour ah

ya see whether can
soccer boots soccer boots
actually can
can but I don't know that one is it's
right
what ten dollars
ya the soccer boots you should lah
err
ya because the thing is when I buy it's also second hand
so I don't know better
ya but I bought it second hand
that one I bought in so I don't know whether this one
authentic or not authentic so I really don't know really
because I went to the cobbler bukit maju right
then he say eh eh actually I got another shop at just wanna try it on
then I say eh okay try
I have two boots
I fix one boot then I buy another boot why ah
so I don't know why ah

oh cause my one I watch on Netflix so no advertisement
I leech off my cousin
oh talking about singapore ah cause they want to try to cause no tourist what so they want to try to increase the tourism board they got a lot of interesting attraction nowadays now fifty percent off at zoo eh or river safari or night safari I haven't been lor cause my family trying to get the tickets ah then there's also like discounted price for you know now is fifty eight dollar like including a LiHO drink then other than that um other that and the one land resort I think wildlife resort singapore maybe you can try everybody now going cycling at like pulau ubin or coney island have you been to coney island

secondary school ah
ya ya why my softball teacher my teacher wah seh
I don't know leh last I talk to him was in february I think cause I went down to school lor other than that not much eh cause his insta but never reply to
literature
you got a lot of people right in your group of friends
hmm
surprisingly no leh I never met any of them outside school I've never seen them not even teachers I've never seen teachers outside school but right a bit a bit funny cause I got a teacher who live near me but I never see her before like I know she lives there I seen her once or twice in secondary school but now I never see them anymore
ya ya ya that one
ah hangout ah
but right cause a bit also have but then I I I reason it out my mother ah cause she always make me say cannot other people one actually it's already out there if I don't finish then who else will finish you know
ya very troublesome because like I want talk to them also a bit mafan ah but then thankfully ah I don't have more than five group of friends lor is like in a group of friends I don't have more than five so like just swee swee just like that lor like swee swee less than five all lah like swee five so like don't need a lot of table like I see my friend that one that time they book three table leh I don't know how many people they have but three table then like very secluded so very difficult to like catch up with them so ya I a bit thankful lah for that
I always buy the standard shake with nata de coco fifty percent I now member mah so like I can the nudge you know so like when you collect the you buy the drink ah you collect the point then you can like off set when the next time you buy then you know last time during circuit breaker cause last time mister coconut and bubble tea all close right then you got see or not the trend they got buy the handmade LiHO then they make it at home you got see
you you you got try or not
ah no ah cause I find it a bit expensive also ah then like the bubble tea the boba ah the pearl ah a lot leh then I scared cannot finish then is is a it's like a golden pearl kind then I don't really like the golden pearl I only like the black pearl or the black sugar pearl eh brown sugar pearl
I got try eh Playmade but I don't really like Playmade eh to be honest cause ah their pearl is a different ah it's not tapioca pearl it's not like the normal pearl it's a different kind of pearl lah then I don't really like the taste ah then the I know everybody like Playmade ah but like I find their pearl a bit a bit a bit questionable not to my taste bud ah probably probably you can try then you see then you tell me lor
I
no eh I never but like cause last time my sister same poly as you ah she also say she always buy like McDonald's only like subway I got try your school subway that one once only but then I also know your school McDonald's is cheaper then outside McDonald's right
I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually uh I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you leh
I think standard ah I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how ah if you late to school or like you swee swee you just ah you know five minute before school you reach then how ah you confirm late or not
actually not really ah honestly if I late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school ah only take me about five five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space ah got a lot of big spaces lor but better ah than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad ah but still small ah but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no ah nanyang nanyang bigger then then then then my school
honestly right um my first few days of school ah my first few weeks I cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already lor uh but then like uh how to say ah your my school um some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that one I a bit confusing ah and then the one behind my school is just the sports centre so that one only if you got like if you got like like that ah like then you go there lor
hmm
um honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no I want study then you should study at home ah the uncle was damn rude eh then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it wah like this security uncle cannot say nicely meh COVID already then like be understanding ah we understand you got superiority but like
hmm cannot ah I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already mah then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's um a a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded lor cause got student want to use the wi-fi for mah ya
ya but like our table not so far apart um like they put us five people per table but like how to say ah um they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling mah that one a bit ah cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like ah don't know ah it's just a bit lor
um sometimes it cannot be helped ah because like is mah then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport mah so like um sometimes cannot take it ah cannot be helped so like public transport cannot be helped ah
a bit scared ah but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's uh the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared leh but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe lor don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do lor
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still one the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot ah cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at bedok eh a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit ah cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry mah she find it very
ya lah typical she doesn't like to take unless like she late lor then she take Gojek lor or she take grab
no ah it's actually me I help her book then she just pay lor
nowadays got not much work from home ah but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp ah then the rest all is um cannot work from home ah so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
uh I actually don't mind ah cause she make food mah so I just eat whatever she cook lor
ya cause fast game ah just touch and go so I just go there then come back then like that lor
if I go school right I just buy something for breakfast then I go home to eat my grandmother lunch I don't like you know uh eat outside so that's the good thing ah I I get to save money like that
wah then especially are especially hor they tax you see what they could wah kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya ah anyways ah I think it's time to let go I think we I think we are done catching up I think
nevermind give this person some time ah cause COVID mah then the business never go up at least at least give them some some some money you know
ya serious ah whatever lah okay lah

okay can
hey you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter lah the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
oh really ah so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only lah
oh so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
aww
could you feel like the maternity love already
ah like a responsibility ah
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know lah what is a sign
ah ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet lah
okay cool sis so anyway um
you know ah later I'm going to go err have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having ah is asking me ah all type of weird questions one
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person lah better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is um
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya lor
mm mm mm mm
oh
err but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
ah so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago ah what what would you probably be saying to yourself
oh ah
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me ah I think ah ten years ago I was sixteen right
oh
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met hakim or risahd which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing sia like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very lah so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with hakim also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring ahmad along so we go gig we go um
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met amin yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl ah
eh you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy lah okay
err are you still longboarding err probably all that lah probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit ah I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me ha is the
um
walao eh got so many questions you know they ask
oh ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay lah okay lah ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things would you be petty about
oh
a'ah ah
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys ah right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
oh ya lah ya lah
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
uh huh uh huh
walao eh why she like that one
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it huh you want to fight
me ah pettiest reason ah
err pettiest for reason for me to oh my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay lah petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like aiya like dislike a bit ah ah it's like our dearest lor
ah like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if ah like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so ah sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but ah
ya that's true okay but then again it is lah correct lah it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but ya but then ya lah it becomes petty because ah whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him ah like ah no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate lah right just like annoyed
can
oh is it like what
oh ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone lah right
ah
mm
mm
ah ah oh oh oh
oh because you were julie
oh cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up lah
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya oh you mean she said hi to everyone except you
oh I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it lor
ya lah ya lah for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest lah this one is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's um
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past ah right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like oh is it okay lah then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do sia I don't know I just come sia so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why err ah like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class ah was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that err her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class one not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that eh you know ah she she say ah like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me lah ah she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your err physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
eh but then ah she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to bangkok I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because um she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend ah like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend lah like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
wah I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya lah but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her lah I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her lah but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now lah it's just more of like
mind blown by it like walao eh like I could never sia go through that trouble for man ya lor
so ya petty things ah huh that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me one but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered one
alright okay this one is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mmhmm
oh mm mm
ya ya
oh my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot eh
a'ah ya lah ya lah
err can play a lot of things siol can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like uh so it's just a random skill like oh you so you can do that then you're like ya lor I can
oh that's great sia like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die lah ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like oh she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
walao eh confirm can one lah it's just one line don't be petty lah we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking ah
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful ah skill
second skill um
so random ah but I would pick up sea sea diving eh
mm so fun sia
like in general I've uh I've always been intrigued by the sea
like that's why when shai like her videos ya tioman I always feel like wah best sia ah like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where oh it's very doable you just go tioman
ya but so far eh you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see kan everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
a'ah a'ah ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright sia then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent seh because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing lah
but then I won't be singer lah like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya lor
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions ah
ya lor ya lor
how do you think oo
ah
hmm
light effect
alright um wah if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya lor
I know right
okay this one is the actor is the very everybody will know one
oo
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to err exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya lah ya lah you skip that part lah
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
mm where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
alamak you kills
oo
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few booboos but then again kan he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up lah you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy sia
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful sia season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom err from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing lah like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
ah he will share it ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married lah but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for err everyday
okay eh no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's err wife not wife ah they never married ah vanessa paradis I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this one is also this one is also actually quite epic ah if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version lah actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world lah she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane ah even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day ah like I think she's so inspiring sia like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to err explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her sia for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever lah
but whatever it is ya lah like cheating cannot be justified lah right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and uh angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like sia lah a true gemini sia this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like sia that's like me but like back then lah when I was reckless lah so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt wow
ya oh my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your uh stray kids or like
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman ah
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
oh maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do ah can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
err I can't
err no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no lah it's our opinion mah
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay lah obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five suria like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
oh my god imagine
it would be so epic sia
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
walao eh
ya lor ya lor actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya lah for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where ah
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how lah right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the lah so it's just purely in our imaginations ah
ah how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm correct
eh my god I can imagine sia my one is the zombie
then after that err getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no eh but then ah you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually lor
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month lah then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually lah when but singapore will be the last lah to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy lor so we were all lose weight very drastically
oh okay obviously at each country oh ya because this one humans were extinct right no hope what so no choice lah everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic seh
err
ya
mm ya lor
uh anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
oh my god eh wait wait wait but is activity eh
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like err maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow lah like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely lah like sia I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the err
but that one is like quite therapeutic sia sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't lor I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities sia
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
uh uh
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
walao eh
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya lor then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like ugh okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful one
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this one even more sia you cannot sleep in peace eh you sleeping there lah then like then got hi
then another one hi the patient will like uh shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating sia like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya lor who know you got the dark secret but ya lah I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing ah
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya lah
but it's too dramatic ah
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again ah one year older eh or your age
oh
twenty six eh twenty eight
oh nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know uh it's the same uh the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has eh is damn
ya eh it's damn strong sia babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya lah so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse ah
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life ah so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault lah kan because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it what and she had to go through her downs for her to like oh shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again eh honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing what it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died seh for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish sia
oh and then he's said oh why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes wow
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot sia she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine sia and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
oh my god
mm that's why
okay ah
oh my god you're so right
ya lor stay here forever lah
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house mah
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say ah it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
err entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if err twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot lah seh
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya lah I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay lah
alright uh
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
oh right right right right okay eh I get to know you more lah seh babe from here

yeah when the last time we meet ah

so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
a'ah

true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open

three four K active cases
active cases
from total is like fifty seven K you know
cause like fifty something K
yeah that's crazy
so like
ah yeah true lah but
it's hard for them to like contain it cause so many people
then like not a lot of people also want to get tested
mm
oh yeah
is
the foreign yeah the foreign workers sporting duh cause
the their place place of living is so cramped so it's easier for them to get sick
yeah putting err
that's why they can't escape from their yeah
yeah which is good
yeah
mm
you got any other game
what game

ya err
no thanks to david moyes we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back um bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya ah the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about thiago he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in barcelona central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe sia
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham a'ah
when did they ever not lost okay ah to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean ah but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
arteta
plus minus ah plus minus ah
he knows his a level above everybody else ah no but but K you know there's this two theories of
err two types of players football theory eh two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers kan
ah the likes of
guardiola
and pochettino and martinez and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis van gaal ah ajax school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis van gaal is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but err no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective ah okay err
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent ah
he does basically ah
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen ah in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis van gaal school of control
wait then then I have the flip side ah the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually merino takes everything that is strong about louis van gaal and finds the witnesses so like louis van gaal takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using merino flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing ah
bionic inter milan game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but inter milan won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is err
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's mourinho
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin ah
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick zambia lonso
err err schools that kind of control zavi iniesta chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so err he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why van gaal and cryuff although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
cryuff emphasise more on individual creativity van gaal is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what mourinho exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre ah mourinho he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one klopp
he
klopp denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan
mm

desensitising us to sexualisation so
ten eleven years old kan
eleven years old not wearing ah so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids ah and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences eh
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing lah that's the justification ah so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world ah mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people

pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and

Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show lah then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not ah coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself ah ah to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am kan uh we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous ah but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging tau when you put yourself in and ask yourself
ah ah ah ah ah it's a psychological phenomenon ah it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay a'ah a'ah
sheer willpower ah a'ah
mm ya
a'ah a'ah but
you should lah sial dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but err there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
ah so it's a four seasons
movie then season five err
that one on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
ah then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with
season five
a'ah
which is and is is coming soon
I started on watching this thing called peaky blinders
peaky blinders is short ah it's only four seasons of six episodes each very short
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera ah
I scan one
I keep the browser open
mmhmm
mmhmm
really
okay
mmhmm
which is which yours
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
ya
oh you go it goes in a clockwise
ah
mm
uh huh
uh huh
so where is
oo
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
a'ah
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
why
one corner
wait
oh hawker centre
a'ah a'ah correct
mmhmm
so it's not the
a'ah ya lah ya lah ya lah

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need ah ya

okay
err
thank you so much okay so um
uh are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great ah okay
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
okay
it's it's not a definite shape I can say ah it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or ah specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
unique
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
a few types of mango
and yeah
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on err
nah when like I don't know supermarket
err
err hangs around the station
like late at night
so
okay thank you so much
uh ya exactly like I mean uh
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
um
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
what do you think
mmhmm mmhmm
err
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
like like my sister said it's err
for me it does makes me feel happy
err
mango tea kan
dessert
exactly cause
it's
yellow
and
it just draws
err mango bingsu
err
perfect
sunshine eh
um
it's like a brand
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a uh err a fruit name for a brand because
uh they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all lah because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
I guess
that's interesting
okay
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
hmm
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean uh that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
we don't really think about
oh my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs ah we there's also
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
pudding kan
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
about having mango soda
do you have have you had any mango sodas
okay
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking kan um
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about um
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
okay
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
it's way before all of us
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
so
okay this fruit is not only delicious but boasts
it's actually quite true cause
that
okay the fact that it has it's sweet
eating snacks that is high in sugar you know like
it's
I don't know it's
it could be replaced with just eating mango which is amazing
mango and its nutrients to health benefits
uh it's a good news right because we love eating mango so much
that uh
we know that it has its health benefits
like ya uh such as improved immunity okay that's one of the benefits
wow that's really interesting
protein about
uh vitamin C sixty seven percent of
the reference daily intake
vitamin B six eleven point six percent of the
okay err vitamin A ten per cent of the vitamin E nine percent nine point seven percent of the
vitamin B five six point five percent of the
um honestly
I don't even know what all this means but I'm just reading it out as part of the conversation lah kan
err everyday we learn new things from this conversation
vitamin K okay err six percent of the I I don't know if I've already said that
niacin
five percent of the manganese four point five percent of the
calcium selenium and iron

and okay
k-pop

besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and

the fact that she can
because I I feel like the good show eh the sorry the good place is a show that is not easy to act in because

long leave ah
oh
this year was like late january right
mid correct
ya
ya my ex-colleague
no iffah is in february then the other two's in july then my cousin is getting married is getting married on ten of july then I was like
postpone it
oh
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say lah I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
amalina
she was from griffiths primary
your age
why would a guy be named amalina
I don't know whether you will remember cause ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
mm
ya so you don't remember lah
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin
my cousin got married to this amalina lah ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to err ngee ann secondary ah
and then uh
mm ya
oh angsana yes
ya
zhong zheng or
why ah
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade lah
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
huh
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays ah
kiasu
mm
orh
orh
for for one year ah
one year
mm
how much is school bus eh
hmm
ya
mm
hmm
I think should be fine
I don't know lah should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
ah
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
oh yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes ah
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave lah
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids lah also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say um
ya
ya
older kids ah I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers err
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
mm
orh
mm mm mm mm
approval lah
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
oh so they do teach
wah
busy ah
like
mm
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
mm
mm
it's set auto eh
mm mm mm mm
you say it's uh
ya
ya
ya
oo
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's um
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
uh
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing lah just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then err depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is err cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya lah I mean basically you can climb lah
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
ya like my
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone ah
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
how to say um
I don't know what I'm saying
yes yes yes ya
ya exactly ya
ya
contented yes that's the right word ya
ya
ya
mm
ya I don't know
ya

I can do this like

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place

which I don't think so
I sincerely don't think so lah seriously don't think that it's gonna be
just take a look
ya ya ya we wanna change ya we wanna change in february
february is soon by the way
ah
wah

okay
okay ya
we're good
ah eh eh
eh bro school is eh I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay eh I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules lah
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay ah then I got one website for my
uh module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites kan is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students lah
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like eh this one how this one how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that lah to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like um there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions ah
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota lah
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat lah having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
ask even the professor lah
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively what
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday sia just to do work
mmhmm ya
ya
but
not not on the first week lah like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example ah python err you there's this one
ah ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input ah input format lah
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
it's it's just so bad ah like and then
I don't know like even the other day
err I have this other module okay
ah it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics lah
I I got some friends lah I got some friends here and there
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
ah like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad lah because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things eh
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study eh
okay like that's what people say lah my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay lah maybe is terrible lah
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
I don't know ah to me it's it's it's just nonsense ah
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
err asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up ah just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy lah honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent lah
this type of high
um really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother one ah
they really not brother one but but right at least it's they quite brother lah because
err and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty lah
ya lah ya lah irfan</P1 your age lah but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty eh
ya I eh
ya ya uh everyone there is from like or from poly
wait eh hang on eh
ya ah
ah okay
but
oh part time uni
err um
oh honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work lah
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more rilek ones lah the one the not so snake one
ya
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
which is ten percent of my grades
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test lah eh no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down eh where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they ah
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya lah
stewing from that lah
ya is it is a browser lah on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test lah
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test what
so they ah and then after that the test got webcam ah
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam ah either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam what
ya ya ya um the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
by the way
you have a report ya ah
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
err like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
um just for this report section
ya lah I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
then you know he's just panicking ah
mm trimester
ah so but then for the first year
ah
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in or even in you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay lah maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay ah trimester but then eh my trimester
thirteen weeks also eh then I see eh their semester
what did I sign up for my my I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small lah
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya
no lah err ya lah ya lah
serious I didn't I didn't expect it to be
I didn't expect it to I have to put in so much effort you know
like mm
ya like my sisters were like wah koi koi run
utterly hardworking eh and I'm like no lah I just unfortunately I have to be a hardworking lah
I also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately I have to be
it's just unfortunately I have to be
eh but you're applying for uni you you're applying for uni or are you going to apply for uni
what was your
mmhmm
I think I think march close I think march close
so you did online interview
why how did you screw up
okay
everyone's volume is err everyone's work is high volume lah basically
ah
okay
okay
for all the courses eh
mmhmm mmhmm
okay
um information security
mmhmm ya with honours
wait how can you apply for only two courses they asked for like six seven courses what
huh seriously
uh huh I think it was six leh
uh huh
you thought portfolio was
the heck okay
ah okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
interest
ya like a reference lah
oh okay
oh okay
ya
what was the what was the second course
what was
ya
no that was no the one that with the portfolio what was it
mm oh okay okay
not bad lah ah sia lah if only hmm if only you were
ya I know right then you'll be stressing out like me also
uh huh ya
mmhmm
ah
oh
I I applied for on err twenty seventeen eh no twenty eighteen or twenty nineteen
eh
ya but then the thing is um
I applied too late like I applied in march also
so I was too late for the for everything so uh there was no slots for me lah
then on the twenty nineteen I applied again and then they asked for a video interview
and then after that the video interview then got the
mass interview like a group interview
ya ya ya but the video interview I got tell you or not the story before
ah
they were like okay so the video they were giving me instructions lah it was like oh video interview is prerecorded
so that means it's not live
questions
then they send it over to me
then
ya ya
yes yes ya that type of thing ah
ya so the other day right um I I had that lah
and then after that one of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
err out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like oh shit
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
I realised that there's this this this lah and have done
this this this in the past and also uh I have some experience with it okay next question
err what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list err I realised that there's maths lah
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths lah that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview lah
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview um it was err
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this err to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like ah then I was talking with my group my lah then I was like eh
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here sia going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know ah maybe ah
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home huh
ya and then like ah okay that's all I was like ah okay I expected something a bit more difficult lah
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the uh the email
saying whether you have passed or not lah like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now lah
mm okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like eh shit I never received any email sia
ah ah okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort lah
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview eh our video presentation how was it
all all that thing lah
ya that's that's how I did it lah I don't know maybe because
but then last year
there wasn't be any COVID yet right
ya so I don't know maybe maybe because you applied too late lah honestly
no no no
okay
mm
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
mm ya ya
mmhmm
oh so you are saying that like
so is that what you're trying to say
oh okay lah
mmhmm
ah okay
okay
mm but what type of jobs are you applying for that's the question
okay
mm ya
no but all these all these honestly right all these like
they ask for like two three years of experience right
okay
uh huh
uh err ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh like prorated kind of thing ah
ya ya ya okay
so

ya lah then because he also I have to meet him soon because
to me it's unheard of ah okay when you an okay then after that when you want to
eh ultraboost is for casual this one is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation lah so I had this ah
I had this lake concept method the other time
and err I will I couldn't get it to work lah even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax lah
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
sia lah
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course lah comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
two thirty
no lah my friends they don't mind me leaving the house
but
that type of thing you know
a'ah sia
I tell you it's like oh goodness

Apex players
I mean I just think it's
like do the controls and stuff then I was quite new to the game then he ask me come nearer then I'm like okay I'll come nearer then he said it'll come a bit nearer nearer nearer then I'm like okay I'll come a bit nearer then you know he taunt kill me which is basically like you you take like he like he pressed Q and then it makes your character do something cool and then it kills you so he stabbed an arrow up my body and then I flopped and a died ya
no no no no no ya but
basically
ya that's my experience I guess after that
did I I think
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal lah I think to be honest the only reason why my like
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter lah or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy lah I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school uh like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
err I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
oh I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with riti but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was uh like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was uh
one of the girls or like there was another girl also lah like I think shahira used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
B ya
ah ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
Taken oh Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less ah
then
oh shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
mmhmm
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got I got
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
kan cause I think
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
I haven't gotten it at all they haven't even confirm no they confirmed my order already but then they never like updated me after that aku rasa dia orang terlupa like I really feel like they forgot about my order but then I like I really keep meaning to email them I always forget in fact I've already ordered another album and I already got that album but like I still don't have the previous album that I ordered
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
uh it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy lah to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
mm I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that one
ya
that one I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it orh ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together oh it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
uh
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
mm but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like set lin hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how works
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
ah ya ya ya him he and
saz were in what is it called ah infantry in or something ya then that one also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference ah
then you know saz also was like a medic sort of like he he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
orh is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then lah don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
uh what do you call it the the one that the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also ah they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit seppuku
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya uh I remember after the war I think after certain battles lah if they lost right they would just commit seppuku and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy uh
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then uh there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
um I don't know ah it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad lah so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
um she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad lah but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just suay ah the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
a'ah a'ah a'ah
it's not even not even an entree
it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
um I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
a'ah
then um
I think
uh like
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then like her money lor then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was mm
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
ah ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it lah to be honest and then they I think everyone knows already lah but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like oh this is
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
mm
mm
mm I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
err what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right err like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
uh huh
ah ah ah
ya
ah ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know ah maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad lah that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
uh natural disasters
ya
ah
that's so creepy
eww
there's like similar stories about this in the basically like they people move into new houses right then you know houses in the are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know lah footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they they wouldn't believe it lah so they think oh maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know ah I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what ah year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less um murdery kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no lah I mean
I don't know lah I mean
mm I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
mm
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad lah it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not
cause
mm
I think
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party lah like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated ah like it's very different and then I think it's like the one
mm
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
ah but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that
dude I cannot believe it and she's like the one of the youngest ah ya
like some went to uh most of them went to ah like some into ireland like dublin ya then some of them went to australia some of them went to the ya
ah ya
ya exactly like you can't even guarantee that you'll get into the olympics
like ugh
ya
ya

eh maybe monday tuesday
oh rates

the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference ah
oh
lame
speaking of travel
of course lah I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer hais that was
global warming
too bad
okay lah but at least you went out so still okay
okay lah
then like that
hmm more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
oh ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that um what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
mm
huh
ah
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay lah probably
it's gonna be better
huh but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young lah
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest lah is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
ah I was looking at this youtube um
the youtube is from america lah
yes
so it's like um
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear lah I don't know lah it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that um she feature lah
and then err the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent what no meh
no it's like
ah it's like a
um
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like um apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though ah
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
mmhmm
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like um you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think um
um and there's no leeway lah
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy lah so I think in that sense err that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
mm
mm
ah
okay is okay lah but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation lah
mm mm
mm mm
err
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
mm
mm
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those um
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
um minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of err amenities for them to study which are like the laptop lah the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in
ah ah
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her lah but for like elders other younger kids leh then how
ya
mm
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today lah I think there were also reports plus err like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
um
thought of
like
okay lah the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans what just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans what so it should be
um
encompass in all this care lah
but I think like
mm
mm
ya
ya even um
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically lah so
err that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
mm
no lah I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of lah I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
oh is it
oh
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on lah
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay lah I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
aiyo but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
hais
don't know what's gonna happen and
mm
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay lor if you say so lor
ah
then there is a big issue lah
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya lah but I still think lah confirm under black market so it's not that much lah
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything one
really what
mm
ya lah but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom what
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already what
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that what they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no lah I think
then animal go home lor
take the bus lor
no lah I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it leh
ah
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also what and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
ah
you have seen it before what
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and err it's an indoor plant
err
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay lah
technically not really eh it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
um
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
ah ah
really meh I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it err refreshes the air ah NASA say one
really
ah
ah ah
true lah
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
huh
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots ah shoots
oh
okay lah but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait ah
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true hor
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong um so
what sort of plant got meh
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
oh my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different lah the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite um it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them um water the plant
like it they pouring into the side lah not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like wow like that ah
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk what
scotch tap hor it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like oh okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care lah

I was thinking like why why what can you do for swimming for three days there's nothing much on top there it's super cold in the morning right did you go to the morning one no
ah
I was
eh so you went in already then rain or what
oh it wasn't heavy rain ah it wasn't like lightning storm kind of thing ah
it's just a drizzle lah
oh okay but were were you cold
cause I remember when I went right Kelly wanted me to go swimming what in the morning she's like let's go in the morning ah then then I like I went in to the pool I just wanna go home already I was freezing inside the pool it was so cold I was like Kelly Kelly Kelly Kelly I like I keep stuttering in the in the pool cause like I just want to leave I just want to take like a hot bath after that
it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
mm
oh
oh okay
ah yeah yeah lah true lah
mm
oh so when you went it's just messy lah is it
ah nothing much
okay
mm
I mean like I I understand that I need to go out like every every week cause if not I feel very like stuck at home
mm
it's nice to go out with your family and staycay lah
what
mm
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred ah no
wah so expensive
oof
try different hotels kan
this staycay in Singapore quite fun lah especially when you go with family or friends
yeah
eh why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
oh never got reply ah
oo my friend got Coffee Bean then I like uh I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong lah she might hear wrong what that's why I scared
yeah but okay lah she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
November oh my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
oh very long eh
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find what you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
kan
mm
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years eh err like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much sia
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
mm
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
can ask like
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's Nisha it's Nisha I'm like oh no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
what
you can hide the body
wah
I didn't know you can hide the body wah I should I should try
mm
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games eh ya
is it all meat or is it just err beef
wah
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
mm mm mm
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like uh err huh
yeah
mmhmm
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
mm
they're waiting for you
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that lah but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan lah
hmm
mm
mm
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that oh we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
mm
mm
yeah
eh
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
wah
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now ah
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
I think that will be more useful lah in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that lah
mm
mm
mm
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi kan
um I mean hmm continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first ah
mm
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help what
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
uh mm
yeah the yeah
yeah uh huh
mm
mm
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled lah
convenience right
mm
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know err not one maybe like some it's very sad lah
mm
yeah
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in California is it California or Oregon ah
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay lah you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer lah that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah lah
really
oh man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
I didn't know
hmm
oh boy is a girl joke lah
rated
mm
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right
hmm
yeah yeah yeah

business management with comms
ya just like one question like the running of it you know lah
it's quite interesting but like
with like everything going on at work like I wonder if it's even worth it you know like what's the point of it all
I guess
like what's the point to like doing anything
if the world is going to fall apart
business
oh that time
ya
yes still still there was still some profits ah it's that
ya now I'm just too busy with school so I cannot do that or inside job

feels like it's it's so much time and like
I I'm not gonna realise any any profits if I sell now definitely
cause right the state of the game now it's like so bad
oh then
honestly ah if it comes wrong then I'm I'm just like whatever man like
ya I'm really just like kind of like given up on the game already
ya just like I mean
the money somehow translate to that so okay lah
ya
ya
ya they should at least like I mean they should at least like balance it out what
I don't know like to keep like the business going and shit like that
I mean like you still owe it to but your customers will be like
they sian about how you manage the game
like reservice
ya
so annoying all these capitalist vultures
they are they are the main reason why is is this pandemic to you state that you please
there's always sole reason why
ya
orh
when was that
really
oh

okay I ask you this
if you were to be given a chance to choose between good looks or fit body which would you go for
for yourself and another person
as in like your soul part your
your dream partner
think if it were me
between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right
ya
like
looking good ya
so what you're going to do after this
today or any other day
orh
you shave it jer lah
really as in like shave
how sia
when less less care about
why sia think you look good what
shaved head

ya he have a house we can just chill inside doesn't leave it for anywhere
ya
people only people just work they get a house and then they die
ya but like
it should be free right
like houses housing
like nobody ask
before they just work
like this is the place
and you need a place to stay
so you make a place for yourself
that's why should be free
yishun
island eh wow

you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by punggol I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night

eh
wasn't it our
oh was it
it's the one that you posted on instagram right
the one the girl with the bangs is it
right

but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big ah
the place
orh orh
orh so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside ah
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone ah
I mean alone with her friends
all the nature reserves lor
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun

ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near mandai area there it's like a hidden
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
yes

the animals all wear masks
the features ah
oh ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
pulau semakau the place coney island
ya
can't remember

I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something kan
thing is three years is quite okay lah kan
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures

cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure

what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
oh ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from yishun
you never went
huh
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four ah
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
orh
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what huh
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and changi airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on changi airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
hais
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be uh happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
oh shit
genie
you eh what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
huh
oh never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay lah I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
ah
what would I want
ah
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
uh
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
oh my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long eh from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
oh shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
oh ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
oh ya and that as well
uh huh
oh ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough what
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay ah
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all lah but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
ah
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
cat
ya
ya only when I
only when I go to like the east east east area like
pasir ris or tampines then
huh
oh no I haven't seen him for very long sia
ya cause when I've been like super busy with my assignments
ya but I'm like
I'm like going to
uh I'm planning to like going to see him soon ah also
wild cats
oops
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
ah I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
uh she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now eh
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
oh ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do lah
mm ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
uh human civilizations will be like
uh
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example lah then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like uh like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
uh issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
oh no lah like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff lah like taking care
uh like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like ah I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like uh like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
oh yes yes yes
that's so sad
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
if I was the judge I would say that
just
oh ya that's like really
oh why
okay I think we're gonna be done soon
ya okay ah next time ah
see you

I want to watch the bridge curse
you don't want to watch

smart for me
I always do my work last minute
what the teacher teacher give me so many work to do
okay but I oh anyways I studied as much as I can and I got the good results that I wanted so
what
mm I think I cannot lah I remember when I was in primary school
the moment they stress me about studies I cannot function any more
ya
mm ya kind of mine wasn't give up I just cannot function
no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because kan
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day what
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous uh homework lah
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no meh
it's like
okay for example eh you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember what
until now I still do that
ah lah primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
same lah
ah think you know you are only one year older than me
so the timing is about the same
just saying
the changes is after me
what born
two thousand one
mmhmm
I don't like that let me surely you are young
oh I thought is
oh oh I thought the same ah lah sorry ah lah sorry
you just now say you talk enough my turn I okay lah you talk lah you talk
I just listen lah
faster give me something else to do
so annoying
ha so what I want to say see lah I forget already
oh I remember P one I was the teacher's pet
ya
but I think
a'ah cause I got bullied in P one
so I became the teacher's pet
the teacher just dote on you
dote on you
uh huh
I guess
sure
ya but everyone
no
like I remember she
she was my favourite teacher miss lee
cause I
okay okay okay
oh ya sure
anyways
she always like I think cause I got bullied a lot by these three people in my class
so she always took me to the staff room you know the staff room in primary school kan is out of bounds
ya but then she always take me in there and then I sit there at her desk go watch movies with her
ya
because in recess I think every every recess they always bully me
I can't remember lah but I remember got one time I sprayed water on my friend also
she sounds like me eh
mmhmm
mm
oh she throw there
ya
mm
mm
why
what's wrong with that

how to say I don't think I want to relive my secondary school live
cause so much drama

sometimes I was the middle actually it's hard to say lah there was this one big drama I think in sec four
I wasn't I wasn't in any of the side
but then I didn't I really didn't like it
ya
how to say
not the whole cohort lah but the whole
ya the whole
mm because we were the leaders what

then I was like remember
okay I was like
it's not my fault lah
I know ah I I don't know why
I was like the evil person in class I was the bully in class
ya which is funny cause I got bullied in primary school
a'ah no I remember
mm whenever someone want to fight right I fight
even if that person don't want to fight with me want to fight with someone else I will fight for that person
I remember got that one time
there was this game we're supposed to play it was a spoon in your mouth and then you have to balance the ping pong ball
ya ya
and one of this this one girl was picking on this other guy
he's a very small guy ah
and then last time I was very I wasn't big lah
but I was bigger than the rest for some reason
which is hard to ya it's hard to imagine right cause right now I'm the smallest person
you know last time I was big err kind of big
bigger than everyone else
kan
ya and I was very how to say gangster
ah gangster ya and then after that
was his name afiq I think his name was afiq he was a really small guy
like those flimsy
you know and then she was she was picking on him and then after that I was just like
I was just like what
uh oh
sorry
sorry
ya
oh
so fast
I didn't think it was impossible you thought it was impossible to talk me for one hour
you what
he's lying he's lying
don't believe him
I hope you don't consider him
a'ah
annoying

hey how are you
almost two months ago
kan
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
mmhmm
a'ah seh
ah sia like a blessing in disguise ah eh
okay lah
you heard
but
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now lah but um you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done ah
ya actually I am most of the time only like err two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from err the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time lah
a few hours at least
in a week
ya lah I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
mm
huh as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
oh my gosh
mm
ya I know you always do lah you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere lah
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
oh
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you ah like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age um
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one um app away or one call away so
mm
is it I never heard of that before
mmhmm
oh my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
oh
mmhmm
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good ah
as cliche as it sounds lah
um healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my err to get my workout in ah on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it ah
ya
mmhmm
oh is it
mmhmm
what's the average ah what's the ideal
that's normal ah ah
that plays a part ah
ya mm
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
mm
ya lah it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more um you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad what I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face sial babe
oh no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay lah
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on lah
it's like that
ya
oh yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it eh is it K one or nursery eh
err K
there seven
oh
primary five eh
primary five ya
oh my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like oh my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other kan
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
mmhmm
ah
mmhmm
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
mm
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know um from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times lah but
you know like um in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay lah um being in a relationship of friends ah like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this um saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like err people come and go
and especially when the err when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men lah but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women eh I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay um you know
um you shouldn't get back to your err to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly kan err maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience lah but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense ah I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up ah
mm
mm
aww
aww so cute
a book like a diary
oh right okay
oh my gosh
eh but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
eh that is actually a good thing like um it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know um on paper
mm
then it hit you ah
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like um
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
um
mm
mm
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up ah then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
oh my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
mm
ya lah like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up eh not not the cause of your okay lah somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay lah I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya lah but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
aww
wow you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
eh oh my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly eh when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
err it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead lah it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on err cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay lah
you know
but err do you know if he's attached now or not
oh my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
oh is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore sia I can't even remember
eh isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah um let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
eh you don't don't say that about yourself lah you are amazing
mm mm
oh my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
eh ya oh my god I almost forgot about our makisan
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging

I feel that err more
responsible lah right ya and then you also try to manage your time and priorities mm
ya exactly correct correct
mm
I don't know I mean I've been
err looking at
err design ya design err I think recently lah I just picked up like err cause err
I'm like
talking about err homes and stuff so I'm like err interior design like err just interested
like ya to get into that
which I don't know it just kind of pick my
my mind yes uh ya say can say so
mm ya
so then how about you any new things

err there's this cafe I think err
there's this shop I think called squisito ah ya they got some italian pasta all that like my favorite ah
ah that's why that's true also lah that's why
ya make reservations lah
ya but so far then maybe apart from that
I will just err
uh
ah ya they did err I recently when I went they had this
position lah ya like two people
ya ya they block the seats ah ya so err okay lah I mean like you you I I
then like
mm
ya ya ya I know
okay lah not bad
got a few movies ya
mm
mm what
one thing that make me annoyed ah
that's why so it's not easy mah
mm
ya correct correct
mm mm
mm
ya true lah
I see
ya understand
agree
mm ya ya
so like
mm
is there any of your oldest
the the longest I mean how to say err
like
mm
oh
mm
orh
I see nice nice ya I mean for now I'm also having
like I still keep in contact with my secondary school friends lah let's see my primary school
my primary school
my primary school friends
my primary school friends err it's like err
they are not
they are not
err in contact with me much because they
they are quite busy with their own lifestyle already then I also not that close now with them
ya
ya we keep in touch lah like of course ah like we go jamming and all
lah together so like ever since then
ya we still
ya we're still close lah
ya we also ah
mm
ya
ya ya ya like like
I ask hi how are they going
so ya sometimes it's good to ask lah how they are doing
so ya
mm
mm mm no lah
mm mm
ya
I see a'ah
opposite err not really I'm a very dynamic
I have a dynamic taste in music lah okay
I think cause sometimes I like loud music but sometimes also like like like indie also
ya introvert
ya sometimes loud music helps you destress mm so I decided and also
ya it's like
err emotional ah ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
just
lah
ah service ah
ya
so uh huh
struck an idea that that
ya so uh this is one way lah we can
err bring
bring it up
to them ya so
mm venture
I think
uh about
and
and stuff we are
err more more in depth
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity lah kan
mm
ya I can see
err physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise err with my contacts over there lah
uh ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no lah I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
ya
one of them is not is a housewife lah so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this lah then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time lah time management so far okay
try to err minimise our workload lah
mm from day to day
ya
but uh I think it's okay lah it's a feasible business I think ah what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with
or mm
mm
mm oh
nice orh nice
uh huh
mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya hopefully lah
hopefully
ya
a'ah
mm ya ya
opportunity for us
mm
kan
okay
ya honeymoon mm maybe consider ya
like that but actually err can say I'm more of a sightseeing kind of person lah
ya
I think
mm
ah ya that's way road trip yes
ya so
so
it's it's good lah to bring them
err better I mean
ah
ah okay lah interesting
ya
mm mm ah ya lah
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season ah mmhmm
mm
mm
I see actually no I mean
err spring is considered err winter right or is it after winter sorry kan ya but I I mean I personally also like winter lah
but err winter like it's very fun lah cause
aesthetically I would prefer err autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice lah ya
mm ya correct
mmhmm ya ya is like
once the this is all over kan
mm like you really mm
wow
it was it was actually during autumn lah that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
they are very err
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you one without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire lah about them
then so ya singapore err ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya lah but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way lah right
since young so
that's why
ah then orh
there's the bullet train lah ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no lah I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train lah it's just the high speed train which
like normal lah I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's uh the food
really
mm ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places what so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan

oh oh oh
orh okay okay
yes cause I I my mum okay I he this person works as the receptionist the bell the bell worker or something like that so he was the one who were assigned rooms to the guests
so he said usually
he did mention the highest I don't know whether this one story where the highest level or one of the top levels they closed it off
they don't let anybody in
ya but basically this guy was saying this guy was saying ah
uh no he didn't say the top ten floors he just say one of the high floors they closed it up cause of there's a lot of incidents where people encounters uh but
so I think you were the unlucky one
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
uh huh
I have to go home later
and your house is freaking temple beside and with like a freaking you know the the temple I oh
it doesn't make me feel better it doesn't
uh
okay I mean like I guess I'm gonna take Grab later
to the
I can feel it when you were mentioning that you had no neighbours
and then you could hear children laughing and all that
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I wouldn't want to go back with that story
creepy seh
okay
I did that I did that um
I did that uh what happened was when in korea I actually encounter some things supernatural so I actually recite the quran ya
I experience
uh huh uh huh yes
yes yes
wah
crazy man

oh it's okay um jurong and woodlands not very near also what
oh what bus was it ah
mm
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before sia
like the only bus I will take
to go jurong is eh
I don't know honestly I don't know
um yeah I mean I go to school like I study in jurong right okay technically not jurong lah clementi
but usually like I take and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
ah yeah correct I take the train from marsiling
to clementi then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat ugh
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
I feel like oh it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance ah like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
um
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school oh yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever eh like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
hey loser
mm
oh my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time ah when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like azan or something
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from jurong jurong eh
johor bahru to and where can we go in singapore jurong to tampines
like what the heck so boring
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
mm
what
what so the police like
hmm
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
like ugh it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website lah then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then ah
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
for me ah yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read lah I just saw the headlines it's like eh extended
oh right that's true oh I forgot okay anyway
ah fun fact I dropped in sec three
cause I sucked at I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place what at least last time like
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the oh I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
I always tell myself like oh I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
hais I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
oh well yesterday ah like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
um
since I'm so used to right I stopped writing physical notes
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
mm
a'ah
um malayan council eh what you eat there
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
it's like quite serata yeah it's like the
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well lah it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it um what does it eh what does it sell
wow that one sounds nice eh honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
but I think like recently I went there like
well honestly
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
um positions and the thing is they always say like oh urgent hiring
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
I myself don't like it also
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
mm
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration lah like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
COVID is still here and it's like
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
mm mm
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that oh they already contained it what like it was from wuhan and like they already closed up wuhan and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
like of course it won't hit singapore
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
mm
hmm
you will look up your president what right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to uh make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president what because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
mm mm
mmhmm
hmm
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb ugh anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
eh guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys lah because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like err tall
then like okay lah like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny sia then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke
yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age ah
so like yeah honestly we clicked
not bad sia so far like I don't know I'm quite
interested
err oh his name is bukhari
and like honestly that's a super like old school name like honestly I feel like my
but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay ah not like
uh yeah I'm thinking about hudy who is one six three that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
okay I wouldn't say that we were vibing but at least like I was talking to him and he was talking to me and it's just
actually
one day and a few hours honestly if I
think I swipe a lot already sia and I think like my taste
not so picky so like I got like
then like honestly most of them are quite interesting but like most of them just say
hi
yo
like boring seh like can you be more interesting please
drummer name his daughters
I don't know
eh that's quite funny eh I like how he made a joke with your name inside
you know that kind of thing yeah
facts honestly but um
so they like put in more effort to like talk to everybody and stuff
eh wait wait wait wait how is Bumble
oh
swipe then if it works out on each other then match
why got like twenty four hour expiry date all so funny eh
yeah honestly and I'm so sad about malaysia extending their thing
I know we talked about it just now but you just reminded me cause I don't know how many foreigners there are
and I really just want to go to malaysia I want to eat my korean barbeque
three to one conversion rate
ah seh I just miss going there lah I remember like everytime we go we will try this place called dolly dim sum have you tried before
but they have the salted egg yolk dim sum and it's like
it's perfect I swear
mm
oh my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something oh no
like I was on the fourth floor you were like on the third floor at Starbucks kan
why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
ah like my mum
ah side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim lah but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
mmhmm
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
mm
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is eh
mm mm
I think
you know how like malay families always say like oh it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it pe in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with ah
mm
mm mm
hmm
actually that's true actually that would be goals ah like
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together kan
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway mm but it was a good movie ah then I always think about it like
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky lah like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
okay you compare like uh prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in
you can get a car in for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
so it's like I don't know ah like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
err university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like oh I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not ah swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
oh sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
mm
mm
mm

okay um
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
are good looking then
you lucky ah
cause you because
you will get you will
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
um
okay lah err I mean
make sense oh going off of that
err
because you were saying like oh live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
then like
err
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like um
note notes lah about err extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I err
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
um
the the the
we're so interconnected lah it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good lah
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up um
then
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
in my in my opinion ah
err too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things lah but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
we will be like eh
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion ah I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
err
enough with that deep stuff
ah this one is
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
that's what I mean
any kind of skill lah like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
okay
I feel like
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
err let me go by one to three err first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is um
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
ya
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for lah especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
err
very pumped up very excited
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need lah to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything lah that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like wah all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
wah actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya lah I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally lah I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
um
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
it's like our safe place ah like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was err stress management number two would be to be very good at
err running
then number three I feel would be
um
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I just feel like
aiya
don't bother lah just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more oh yes
anything like anything in the world
you know
you wish for it and it comes that kind
mm okay that's true
anything
uh
hmm
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like wah I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose lah
in that sense
so it would really
ya
so
that's for me
then err
mm oh ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it lah but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool lah in my opinion
ya ya
oh building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both lah so
can be any
I mean you know mine lah mine would probably be batman lah
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
err comic comic batman
is that
err
in my opinion it will be batman lah
ya ya mm
they are labelled as
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
put on you
I mean oh so basically it is that concept of with great ya lah like you said lah with great power comes great responsibility in a sense lah I mean in this sense it'll be
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff lah that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school lah like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones lah
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
ya lah
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like ah
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya mm
mm
what would your ideal day in life be
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
the difference is like like in terms of
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
then
like
training people
err
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
like if you are talking about ideal day
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff lah we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people lah but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like eh setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
ya
but ya
is is is
it's fun lah
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it lah you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete lah that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand lah that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

mariam
ya
cause I want to make
I want to make brownies but I don't know how
what do you add
flour I put flour baking powder
eh no I don't put baking powder I put sugar the brown sugar

ah
um
oh

a'ah
okay lah but eighteen dollar
ya like my one eighty four
ya that's why
oh eh fadreena
yes fadreena
fudge
so let's hear what's what's your tea on her
mm
mm
ya she has a boyfriend
ya the fuck but the the boyfriend quite uh handsome though but then like why are you bringing your boyfriend into this he's not a part of it also
oh
ya but she do two K though I saw I saw
ya but I feel like same
a'ah
ya that's why
if only wah
oh ya by the way you know rachel got new boyfriend already right
ya oh you met him in real life already ah
uh the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
weird lah sia
ya
uh mm true
did you see the shoes that he buy her the three hundred dollar one
ya
ya eh you know about the olivero also right
he he weird he cannot move on over the fact that rachel already got new and better guy
do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month leh august eh that's why I was like the fuck
ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
mmhmm
for me ah cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you um and is very the timetable very rabak so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy what so I'm like just go for the guy lah he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard sia the guy can could've find someone better what
then
what she want to do now
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex lah
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up sia
then
how did the new guy react
mmhmm
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
if a lot of guys fight over you oh why like so flower like that
a'ah seh
a'ah seh
but then she not stress meh from all these drama
a'ah
yes we are like the one watching the drama not in the drama
I watch but halfway I stopped cause I waiting for the last episode
I waiting for the drama to complete then I watch everything one shot
a'ah
oh did you see the kiss scene
the kiss scene the one they finally kissed
a'ah
but very sad eh cause their rating only five percent leh in
mm oh this one is online one ah
oh
oh ya
I think if netflix can show the ratings then confirm a lot sial
same my kim soo hyun I wish you win
what I want to say ah oh ya
a'ah the the height only ah the height only matrep version
I thinks he's lowkey a pedo eh
and like ugly like not ya ugly and just like I don't know lah cause
a'ah sial
right oh I forget to tell you this same uncle apparently last time previously before me got another part timer named sarah lah she's chinese ah then um I don't know if she knows about this but he go around telling everyone that they're together behind her back
I mean it's like bitch no you're forty four that's so weird ee
delusional and psycho
oh wow

oh ya but this one is I'm dumb check
ah
oh I saw your instagram post
oh
oh ya oh my god that one
uh huh
huh
she live in condo
mm maybe she's those type that fake fake lah state rich but actually they are not rich maybe that's why she like cannot afford the kid lah then she kill but very heartless sial
mm ya that's true
do you think she feel guilty or not
do you think she feel guilty or not
the what
oh
okay means that one is definitely murder sia it's not accidental sial
bastard
straightaway will admit then confess then ya wow
this is why
ya that's why some people cannot be mums pity the kid
ya that's why
eh
ya
mm
siao bye bye sis see you in jail
wah you damn sad
a bit
over the line already ah
mm
bastard sia
imagine you are the father though ya that's why you didn't even get to meet for one time

how does she not feel guilty sia I don't get it
still can like after few months then burn the body
a'ah
huh serious
oh
she's psycho
with that caption
a'ah sial
the lockdown eh cause you need to stay home more mah then the abuse at home all the case all rose that's what the reports say lah ya quite sad lah
eh that one next level sia wah I see them I angry sial that one
no I don't get it why they are not given death penalty why is it only twenty five years jail
ya that one is intentional already
ya that's why
some more the when the baby was hungry right so he go and steal the milk powder because obviously he want to eat what eat milk powder only then like that only they beat him up sial then throw the hot water at him what kind of parents are you sia until you do that this one not human already
oh my god
it's okay they can rot in prison also for twenty five years by the time they come out how they gonna find job also confirm nobody wants
yes
but I don't know lah how these people like don't how to say ah don't feel guilty at all lah meh it's just a kid sia
oh the
a'ah the evil step sister a'ah sial
oh wells
a'ah seh
a lot sia
ya
they honestly don't deserve someone like him lah if he's in singapore he confirm make it big already
a'ah
that's why for their country want to progress very hard lah if they got that type of mindset
is awake
weird lah sial
ya malaysia sis which other country will say this
yeah
no lah now the fine go up to ten K lah I thought
now phase two I think
I think three hundred lah ya
no I think by next next two years
a'ah sial
ya that's why
five years
our
ya that's why
cause before COVID already got a lot of robbery case now confirm higher some more they see singaporean got money then snatch away your bag
huh really I thought that one malaysia I think need ah
I think they like don't care don't care like that ah
just like the donald trump say right um there can be no coronavirus cases if you don't get checked
same
same that's why I think he's just rich lah that's why cause he own a company what like he own the golf club also
ya he got the trump trump golf club or something oh and you know fun fact when he go visit other countries for like conference all this he will only go to his own golf club
so like so like he earn more lah you get it because when he go to his own that one then the his other like guests like this will also go with him what so more business for him lah in a sense
ya now the country is like whole ass movie sia like parody movie like that
huh that long meh I think two years ago what no meh
oh four years
ugh rabak
rabak sial
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him

K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
so anyway um how has your work been
oh oh okay okay okay
how long was it eh the practicum
huh so fast
mm
oh ya okay ya ya ya no no err what was I
suddenly
mm
oh
oh
oh no
oh
mm
mm
mm ya that that's why
ya
ya oh so
they offered you full time is it
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
that's good that's refreshing
mm
mm
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh ya ya ya ya ya that's mm awkward
mm
mm
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
mm
wait that that that's a good thing kan or
mm
mm
ya
oh okay
or people with experience lah so they don't have to train so much
independent
mm
I see
ya
mm LOL
ya
ya that's true
oh that's a lot
that's why siao
mm
ya
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
oh so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
oh
ya
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
so you're not gonna take take up their
mm
mm
oh okay
ya
mm
ah okay okay
ah
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like oh no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
mm make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
mm
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
mm dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in uh you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
mm it's been good I am teaching
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
um switch lah so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like oh my god
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me lah cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you um err I need I'll be like err oh sit down okay or like err
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want lah
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
mm be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
you know my period's coming
tau like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came uh okay lah like out of the six of us only like four people eh two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
mm
uh yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
there's
I'm hoping that aiya I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
mm
ah okay
oh
I see okay good that I
don't then
mm
oh then hers is how much
mm
mm
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby kan
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
ya so she also like told me to just
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
mm
oh that is so
oh my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
you know
it's just like ugh gross
way lower than you thought
oh
mm and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high mm
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something uh
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think inhan sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
oh mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me lah I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
mm
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that lah it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not kan so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans oh chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
err ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just ugh celebrity
I guess
is it mm I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
mm
oh
mm ang mo kio park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
mm ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
and this one quite
oh eco green
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know afiqah afiqah you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
eh were you staying at our table
mm
she got married uh I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite um because like err
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
um they only allow like ten people
mm and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it lah like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
mm I don't think so
oh is the is the one that her long term the one that always eh ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
mm
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
mm
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
um
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
mm makes more sense
oh
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working ah then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
mm
oh like the dad is more chill lah usually
and also like it's a culture thing also lah like oh you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
mm
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time lah to like uh you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
oh okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
mm then what she say
oh my god
uh then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
uh mee tom yum mm one of them
no because now
ah
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time what
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme ah
oh it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious

mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah

I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
oh my gosh
this one laughed
oh ya actually it's true ah a drill is quite safe ah
you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

is it a voice recorder
yup
was the clap loud enough
do you hear my clap

I mean hello kitty is japanese
then I like japanese stuff japanese culture
I mean
quirky what do you mean by quirky
uh huh
like your mug ah
oh that's quirky ah
then
so what do you mean by aesthetically pleasing but
no lah anything lah
you know actually I was thinking I've been thinking how how our house will look like
like if if we were to apply for the woodlands one right
as in
we we don't do like a proper
uh like you know those proper interior design stuff that sort of thing we just put whatever wherever that is
make it make it more unique lah like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say uh
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
you know but then still have a theme
but then like mix and match
ya
like maybe uh
you know how how I say I don't want to buy furniture but I want to make my own furniture
no why
you scared you scared not strong ah
huh
no lah
okay okay okay
I I finish talking already
what
okay like maybe uh I will build my own pond for my turtles

uh huh
ah decoration you know
you keep like personal touch so what what what what
oh ya

oh
ah
umah
why
oh
what did
ah
uh huh
and then
ya
chickens are not legal
no because
ya
like cats are also not legal in what
no like according according to the law cats are not allowed in but then the the the law enforcer
don't rely enforce it unless if someone complains
so ya but then for chicken right is ended I think
uh because it's a poultry meat
so like uh like they don't want
things like bird flu and all
spread
so that's why they they don't allow chicken
but then
I think
um because the law is quite new I think like less than ten years I think
somewhere around there
ya
but
I mean same same as
other illegal pets lah that are
it's got some people keep snake and all also what they ask people to adopt snake
ya lah obviously
ya
I
I want a pond for my turtle

ya
ya lah
ya
hmm
nothing
I mumbling I mumbling

okay hello hi ah amir how are you doing
huh okay ah
doing good err just I don't know
COVID situation
but the same for you lah you're also in army right so err it's just ah social distancing
okay
mmhmm
a'ah what are we doing now
okay understand
mm
ya
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
they take turns ah like in six
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see lah
ya
mm
yes
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh uh mm ah
mm
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
oh actually ah
ah okay okay good
okay lah
a'ah
err
I don't ah nothing much about it it's to me it's err quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause err
I post that like the last thing I said was err it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades ah
ah paradoxical kan
err
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself ah
really your score
really ah I see
ah I haven't seen that
ah same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school err to secondary school lah
as of time
ya ultimately uh what happens err
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about err that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
uh huh
err these days like
like I don't read the news
ya
ah
ya
basically that's the thing
mm
err okay
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army kan
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
or
fireworks
I guess
so
err we come from then
we just talk to our own people lah
ah own circle lah ya oh ya
mm
ya these two years not wasted
ya so far
ya ah
ya err
so unless they went out of their way today
uh huh
mm
ah
mm
do anything else
ya true
ah ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in lah
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time ah if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
err so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
err which wouldn't be applicable lah cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn err can be applicable lah
err recently I went through this uh ammunition course
then err
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff ah err stuff related to storage
and uh inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
err
going out with my family that rarely happens
ah
oh ya it's it's different
I see
ah easily ah ah
okay mah
uh huh ah okay ah
that's that's true ah
most of the practical
ah
same
ah
family sunday
mm
err ya lah
for me I
I spend
on weekends mostly at home ah
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
this usually happens like on a whim lah
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family ah at home
ya
ya that's good
ah
a'ah ya really
ah
ya
ya
mm
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
err
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about err when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one ah like that err
ya but during err during
err the start of the
ya
ah then okay lah oh I forgot ya you registered at the same time as me
yes
yes
bro I only have two tickets dude
I only had two tickets
oh wow okay that's nice
ah must be western wednesday ah
of course lah
ten days worth of days
ya
ah
that's true that's true ya
ya
yes ya
uh huh
yes
uh huh
mm
that's cool that's cool wait
ah ya you didn't do twenty four uh twenty four kan
in tekong ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
hawker center ah
ya
they were like oh thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits lah we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but um is to is to
yes
ya
ah that's a good point ya they just did
ya
ah nine weeks and then next one nine months lah
ah eh I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you oh you're going to talk about the pay kan
so err to me okay
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
err back in kan my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but it's okay
ah okay
ah
ah
ah same
ah
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending lah
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
ah
mm
ah
mm mm
oh no me too
mm
mm
ya
same
yes yes oh my god
oh
election ah
ya
ya that's how it is but uh personally I also don't
err I don't follow that much
err I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates ah oh my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections kan every day they will talk about stocks
wah buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive eh ah this one going up the percentages all
ya and err
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good lah I think it's good that
err more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
mm
mm
ya that's a good thing ah that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we err get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good lah
but the thing is that after this
we're going to go through how many years
err
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much ah
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
ya so
ya
okay
ah
ah
ya
mm
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K err by the end of
err because I I've I've made a lot of plans ah like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with investment savings plan
insurance oh my gosh yes
a few bucks okay lah about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
err how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
mm okay
mm
yes
mmhmm thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic
uh huh
ah
ah
mm
ah
ya actually though
forgot
you're talking about
pay right leading into something else
was it
ya financially independent correct
mm
mm
carry your own weight lah
yes
mm
ya the thing is that of course okay family is written in my blood you know
the they'll be there for life but they won't be there for life like for your life
you know what I'm saying ya the
like eventually you have to live your own life ah so
err you have to start eventually
and now is a good time to start being independent
ya we can yes yes we can that was the idea
that was like we were going to talk about food
ya I don't know it's you it's you you brought it up yes
what ya I don't get it
and like okay in school or like even now
people can talk so much about food I I don't I personally don't get it like wait have you tried this thing
or have you ya
not dude err not about that but what what did you ask amir
what's my favourite food oh snap
err my favourite food is
the scone from texas chicken
the scone the biscuit thing
mm ya
ya
ya
oh
that's true that's true
for the taste or
nugget okay continue
yes
a drumstick
ah
huh
a'ah
ah
yes
ah
ya it's booming
yes
I do too I do too
ya same ah
so you look at malay people you got the highest obesity rate
highest diabetes rate probably I'm guessing
yes it's delicious
okay ya it's not so good for health
ya
you said comfort food right
ban mian ah ban mian
ah okay tom yum
ya
what is like the maggi tom yum
ah
ah
yes that's true
ya
okay understand understand
mm
just so and so ya
when secondary school miss the pe pe
err swimming lesson kan ya then after that
everyone including everyone has maggi
yes
oh my god ya
ya
ya that was the times
ya
it doesn't fill but yes okay maybe back then maybe in primary school in in early secondary it fill
oh it's it's always bulking season it's like in it's it's it's mean
what thousand calories let's say ya ya thousand calories and I think that's not even enough for me
cause of the amount of work I do everyday but it's okay ya it's a eh that's another thing ah
err
sometimes okay there was a point like when I was studying for A levels right when
I was eating almost purely for sustenance
like I was just buying the cheaper stuff like err
what saying yes
wah
are you serious I went up by sixty ah
oh my god
ya
comfort ya it was comfort also okay okay okay
ah
uh huh
yes
ya that was the essence
mm yes it's true
huh
ah yes ya and I didn't mind I didn't mind it
because it was a perk for studying
no the thing is that I mean for sustenance because
I mean it because I would spend five hours inside an aircon room
just going away at my books
or okay I don't okay lah I cannot read for that long but
ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
ya so
then after that go back to study ah that's that's what life was like
err doesn't matter as long as it's food
and it's cheap cause money was
I mean okay my family is is in a fortunate enough position to not worry about that but
considering how much I got per month yes
oh oh my gosh oh my gosh
yes
ya and then non muslims also queue up
ya
no but I think it was it's fucker level it was fucker level
and
it technically was illegal in school canteens but it doesn't matter it was good and everyone liked it
ya used to be a secret menu item right
yes
ya
ya
yes
yes
mm
oh was in the canteen yes that's true
I never skipped lectures by the way
that's a that's a very good point yes
no I sleep during lessons that's the thing
ya oh my gosh
the thing is that I still sleep during lessons even now in
nothing has changed
err except I have to study less now so that's good I guess
err no nothing nothing too complex I can make sandwiches but okay
but I still make sandwiches if you think that it's just
taking raw items and putting it between two breads no there's a lot more to making sandwiches the
just take and pop
okay lah even on the pan okay fine I'm making it sound like there's more than it is
yes it is
it's not ya
ya
ya
mm
do you cook
okay
I remember yes
I get that a lot
a'ah lah
yours was half a bite sized
experiment ah experiment ya
ah that's true that's true
a'ah
ya you don't you don't think about that lah as a as a new cook even
yes
they'll just tell you how to do things easiest okay sometimes they does
but even then even then you have to create ourselves
yes
yes ya pretty wholesome
and he dodged my mum
a'ah
ya
eh was that was that trip just for me
oh my god
ah
okay
okay
yes ah
my gosh that was mad you oh wait
ah
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like err
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the
ya like that I help but
err ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
mm
ya
why is it
uh huh
okay
mm
ya
ya so
you doing the thing ah doing the thing
yes
yes that's true
yes ya
ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others lah
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
mm
ya
ah yes
mm
ya so ya
I don't know I don't know how it got here
ya
ya food

aduh
I don't know what to do eh mala and me are like
halal
halal
okay then what was stopping you thought
a'ah
and she was eating mala so
and she's quite one of those like religious kind of girl so it should be like halal kan
I don't know I was thinking of texting rusydi like
to either dabao or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat mala I was like
you took it for granted ah that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
ah
you usually eat the chinese sausage it's
it is
oh ya ya I did take that
we got the like the duck
ya it like flavours the whole dish
ya
ya
Ichikokudo ramen a'ah
as a family you mean like family dinner ah
ya so I think to me ramen is not my
oh you like you like yours ah
no I didn't
uh garlic ramen I felt like
the richness of the flavor tau
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
uh
it's lesser
it's
ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
but this one the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much ah to me
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
oh uh
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
Samyang
ah
the packet one not the cup
oh okay
serious
ah
ya
um
mm bachelor of
to be honest ya to be honest
err
okay so then I would I can get ten thousand off a year ya so it'll be twenty eight thousand and I'll only be there for two years so it's about fifty six thousand
no like I I called the overseas education it's like a
they liaise with the university for us
ya I called ya
kan ya ya ya
that's why I was just thinking then she said accommodation about uh eighteen thousand to twenty thousand a year
ninety plus already besides cost of school
ya like for real ya
right
ya
oo period
period
bro
ya attachment issues
elisa
a'ah
mmhmm
okay
super smart okay
how her is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known tau because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
oh
daphne also four point O
what
oh ya ya of course lah
vibe
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
make enemies with a snap of a finger
oh
oh
down to the T I guess
ya
mm
oh
a'ah yes
ya
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there what
ya
loan right is a very risky
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember ah I honestly can't remember
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
oh ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low ah to be honest
which one
that's all ah he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe ah
but ya
but it's still a bit risky ah like what if I can't find a job
kan
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local lah
like no matter what
it's quite scary ah to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
um
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
but I would not choose a class
kan what course right
ya because you did you know that I have a passion for planes right
foundation no because they will reteach A math A math is in year one again
of polytechnic ya

the TikTokers in general
do you notice how
as a person
super
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know avani is not as famous as the rest
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
ya because it it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn lah to
ya
ya
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
mmhmm
um talented
like legit it's legit just uh
period
going out and drinking coffee
fidgety a'ah

it's like having an anxiety attack but like intenser
after that
like for thirty minutes later ya I I literally like I don't know it was so bad
ya
it's the white coffee tau you know it's like basically caffeine like zero per cent eh zero point one per cent that kind of vibe
ya
and knowing that I have like
caffeine like resistance and like all these like bad stuff
anxiety a bit
ya

ya it's it's basically just to get your money lah
it's so useless even if you pass fail it doesn't matter you just have to go through the simulator
then it will be easy
then you should do final theory ASAP also
final theory is more to me final theory is harder than
theory
no it's different content also you memorise a whole different set
I think I took like two hours memorising everything
ya
I did it in like legit like eight minutes

ya
like hi hi hi hi
I'm good I'm good
I just finished exams
and gotten my results
fail
to like err online exams no no I'm I'm like not a huge fan of all this online stuff at all I hate it I really really hate it
I was like
ah really cannot I really cannot cause I'm type of person ah who like um prefers everything like to be there in the traditional way ah right like physically seeing your lecturer lecturer and then like taking down notes physically
like like I can't can't do I can't do it I can't do the virtual thingy I really I really don't find it like um
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
mmhmm
mm
ah
mm it's
still not the same right
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
eh but serious ah forty eight hours
oh my god
uh uh uh
mm mm
mmhmm wow
mm okay I see I see eh uh but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long eh
uh
oh okay
mm mm mm mmhmm
wow five sections
mm mm mm
mm not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
ya is it what you using
mm
mm that's why
okay never mind
can lah but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
like there's like a bit like
anyway right um
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then um ah she also specified lah like um the uh
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard ah I I don't know it's like um it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that um
ya
eleven essays
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of um the the the the submission period
lah cause I cause I honestly feel that um the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say kan it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like uh my back was like crying for help
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your um attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like err I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse eh and then like um like like like uh
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you ah I expected like worse cause I feel like um some of the modules they were like quite uh heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very um drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like mm like I was quite satisfied with um my results lah cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being uh quite lenient lah
ya ya
ya
uh huh
mmhmm
uh huh
eh you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
cannot ah
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
oh
ya
ah ah ah
uh huh uh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm
ah cause
for me like ah for me right um
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
she was like as like for like every week
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy um course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students ah I I honestly feel that way I mean
ah in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful lah
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
so I was like ah it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
especially when like
um like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating kan
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
oh okay that's early I mean
we just finished exams right
mmhmm
uh huh ah oh same same
same I'm taking malay also ya
ya but level two cause I took the level one already
mmhmm
ah
okay
mm mm
oh
ya ya ya ah so it's not so draining right cause one
so I just got in so maybe like my classes will start tomorrow I think
ya so ya
but then right how's for you ah
ya
ya
ha ha ha
uh huh uh
mm
sorry what good place
uh huh
okay okay and then
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh uh huh
shared oh oh
oh okay
uh huh huh
oh okay
uh huh huh
uh huh
uh huh
oh okay okay
okay
funny
it's a funny show
it's a funny show
oh no
no no other sequel
oh okay
okay okay
okay
this year
mmhmm
me
uh I would usually I don't know I do I do I don't really keep track of what I do I would just I don't really keep track of what I do but like if I were to remember correctly like on like a normal days
ya
ya
like really anything I will just like switch up to like a lot of a lot of things
now cause I really I don't know uh then this my daily ah most of the time I think I think I spend all my time watching random videos
if not I spend my time on social media I spend a lot of my time on social media
uh
I
social media oh
I don't know is it
ya ya ya ya ya ya
like it
sometimes people like express their opinions like openly kan
kan
ya
they will just
ya ya ya exactly exactly
kan kan kan kan
ya
ya ya ya
ah
uh huh uh huh ya ya ya ya
mm
mmhmm mmhmm ya ya ya
cause like
it's like ya I mean I know what to say
okay what
mm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya cause for me right um I I I sometimes that I really I know what to say I know what to say it's just that I don't know if I will be able to word it in a way that people understand where I'm coming from you know
mm I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like um people reply and they have like err like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like oh no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
kan
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly oh really I mean then
mmhmm
uh huh
a'ah
ah ah yes yes yes
ya ya I mean
mm mm mm mm
um sometimes sometimes
mm cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you I don't know sometimes I feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like ah sometimes I feel like ah I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like uh just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like oh okay can can already ah then you know activate back and then like okay already
ya cause I feel that sometimes like as much as there are a lot of like healthy discussions online there's still like those people who like to force the opinions on other people which is of course not healthy like you know and these are people like you find like
uh
it's like uh like I mean
ya I mean like sometimes you like I mean I get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know
you know

eh it's good catching up with you though
mm ya you know when you don't have like classes
okay then bye take care
bye

okay I think we're recording
err so my name is Umar and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start eh so basically um
then after that um when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in Jakarta err celebrating Chinese new year lah
um the the the hype so called or the whole issue err it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore um and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then um the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and uh at first I was going to work and slowly um you see more and more people
um we were eventually taken over by um okay eh at first it was China lah and then second it was Singapore
at first ah this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries uh in Italy
is the highest lah so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
err but that's how I remembered my experience um when it first started err and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like um I wasn't employed anymore err after this whole situation so now looking for job lah
some authority figure ah
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that uh you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen err
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say err I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that err gone viral for no reason
um
Hadi dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see Hadi kan
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny ah but I saw the article lah I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes kan
because if you think about it um just the fact that during this whole uh circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
err actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
err the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
mm mm
mm well I have this opinion about uh all these food delivery ah so to my understanding ah
but err food delivery eh so I feel that um it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all um
and they are blue err blue collar workers kan so think about this for a second eh to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to um like basically if you apply kan most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for uh the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it kan so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar err job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about err food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day lah for example on her electric err wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is ah okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is um you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet lah
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to err
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway um with regards to that uh there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
err err employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis lah in singapore so whether you are uh as mentioned before whether you are
err low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide kan
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver kan
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab err you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your err err picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really err let's say you already have a bicycle lah let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility ah and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way lah it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe err do a three hour trip err three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home lah so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
uh as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that um a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such uh active um kind of employment especially for the lower income uh people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
err it does
um so during the circuit breaker period of pe was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing um did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery err did you meet anyone or
oh okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no lah if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say eh I'm doing this err exam err next week
err I pay you two hundred dollars lah just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay pe
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well ah because when I was in uni uh um a lot of people who went to like me kan they err
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance oh out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but err
sometimes err if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
err for a couple of years you actually um understand and appreciate what err higher academia can bring compared
to your peers err in school at the moment kan even for myself kan if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and um if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or uh it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
um you know it's the uncertainty of err okay lah
you know if I don't do well then don't do well lah you know but uh once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and um some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful err well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks lah toilet lah
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people um
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
err I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
um if doubly is even a word for studying
so aiya I mean so
I don't know eh ultimately it is a state of mind lah so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type err Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but err if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well Nurul didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker lah so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year ah
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went Jakarta once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February what
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in err late January it was Chinese new year I had to go Jakarta but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May err April or something ah it didn't happen anyway so ah whatever lah
just need a break cause okay if you think about it kan people other than Singapore
who
ah that one is err he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says err fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty
what am I doing recording this at two in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about err thirty plus dollars that's all just uh a top up ah
twenty five thousand dollars ah jer
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
hmm
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour

all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit ah
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong ah honestly ah honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic ah I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit ah
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike ah
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know ah cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it lah ya but today
um I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl lah so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance ah maybe today I might pass ah that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said oh then
then why I cannot the same ride again ah
so
oh so that was me and then about that girl
she was um she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back ha so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there lah
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place eh I already down to gear two already even before that ah
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there ha my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that lah that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that uh she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
ha instructor instructor was there all the while ha so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
ha you concentrate or your bike ha you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall ah because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver lah maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
ha cause it's it's a bend what
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no lah I'm okay lah okay
then after that like
after that uh when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
uh the instructor tell me he said uh
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her kan he say you just go ahead first ah
ha prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck sial
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really meh you use your foot brake what
really
huh
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
oh class two ten seconds slower ah
ha
but you but on on on gear one right
ya lah half clutch ya actually can what
is it
serious ah
ah
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know oh bobber bike kan that one ah the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country eh is it mutt ah
mm
confirm ah
ah
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred ah
ya lah that's why
bikes is it was it bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
mm
huh who
oh
sanfu ah
paya lebar
for the mutt the mutt ah how much
excluding
machine price
oh inclusive a'ah
last year's was how much
ten thousand plus
ha
that bike is expensive ah
zontes cheaper ah
huh the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening ha
sell out your bike first
mm
mm
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
mm mm mm
I think that you should consider that
there are many people who have class two bikes ah
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is ah on the roads ah that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred hmm mm
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
ah
is it
ya
huh
per two weeks
oh engine oil to oh you change ah ya that's about two weeks lah
sixty
oh ya ya ya mmhmm
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
mm
forty eight ya
for every
ah
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer ah get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
uh
it's nice
it looks like bro
eh but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger uh
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five oh but
fifteen I think sixteen litres ah
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
oh desaru
it's as good as you are dead because it's not cheap you know to tow the bike over um
I don't know how much ah malaysia to singapore lah but uh three hundred always eh where you are lah it goes by distance what
wah
then how
the risk is there but that's why I said
mm
don't know
ah
huh
no
wah serious eh
ha ha benny rios ha
with who ashik ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm

I don't know how he mount the kerb ah

it was when he when he took off
but when he mounted when he mounted the kerb
he was still sitting on a bike the old bike went up went up the kerb and then he crashed to the wall

ha and last time I ha and last time
the the chances of people sending their their their their slots like very high like everyday be lazy what
so
even when I was
even when I continued doing uh when in woodlands when I was staying at chinatown
it's possible lah
I remember three point two E brake ah
fail
no I think uh exceeded the line got exceeded the line
the back also
but the the pullback you will feel lah because your engine breaking is active what ah then you really feel the thing on the the whole bike were you'll feel the jerk ah
no my last was uh circuit division
wait lah
and then the second one uh no actually I took I took I took the circuit assessment twice
after the after the salem salem plus kan
I was I was I was joining ah
I signal
I signal I saw the lorry was there but was quite far lah
I don't know what happened I
what I did was I went to uh I went to throttle I think I throttle too hard or don't know what lah
because I'm on gear two what I didn't stop I want want to actually don't need to stop didn't ask me to stop but it's give way what it's not
it's not uh it's not a stop line
so I went to throttle but I think what happened was the the there was skid mark on the floor
so I throttle the whole bike went this way sia
I cannot turn
too fast already ha so just one thing slip so instead of the bike flying
so I fell out with the bike was on the ground already you know engine still on ah bike was on the ground eh no no engine like stop
then I remember I sat down I sat down I adjust my helmet I turn the lorry still moving
still moving then
and I look at the bike and I
then he you start to came out of the lorry I don't know what after that he say ah sir are you okay I say ya but you hit the bike not me ah I said I I fell off earlier already
I said okay
and then the instructor don't know from where he came my instructor ah I don't know how he suddenly just turn up because he was actually at the E brake side I don't know what he was doing here
he came to me he asked me like okay or not I said I'm okay
that was the that was the last one
I I don't know
I was not
nothing ah nothing ah
should be school what ha
it's a learning school what
then they need to have insurance for their cards to be brought in for lessons in the school
because not every not every
ha

they just there to give you ah
a'ah sia
three minute

I was she was still texting me ah I was telling you everything what
then uh

oh
really remember the script
wow
I think ya I heard I heard too
mmhmm
why ask
well this is my question to you but like okay I'll answer
um
that's the real life like this
that's what that's what happening outside and
you know we tend to forget that
we're not we're not the only one we're not
and we're not just the earth doesn't just come by of singapore you know there's other places but we're not sure of how they living the life
and how this these things gonna actually happening in other countries we don't see it in singapore
you know probably like
um serial killers there are some in singapore but it we never know how gore can it be how how how other people could like you know be be that crazy to do something like beyond humanity
mmhmm
um I wouldn't say I remember
but like what gets me is it was black magic kind
you know
black magic usually like from malaysia
like they will kill each other for it or or maybe like family
they kill each other
the daughter kill the mother
or the daughter kill the parents just cause power ya
or drugs
you know how like could be and it turned everything upside down
you know
mmhmm
right
oh ya
it's not there
mmhmm
anything
speaking of existence
um
how do you think human will become extinct
how how
how
yes we've seen a lot of um what do they call it
apocalypse
how human get become extinct
you know how how um how
food or you know mostly movies is like
they eat something wrong and they become zombies
and then they kill and then the whole country becomes
like
like non-productive anymore not not working anymore you know they just become zombieland
what do you think
mmhmm
sure
mmhmm
of course ya cause you're not sure whether you are you're still alive by then
ya how would human extinct how do you think we would extinct like lack of food or you think
virus
ya COVID
crazy

hmm
mmhmm single digit
what's that
hong-kong
or taiwan taiwan
mmhmm
right
right
softly
is that a song
mmhmm
a cure
ya
a vaccine
right
right
right
but I feel you know what I feel
I feel like you know how scientists are coming up with
there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS
what time is that yes
but you don't have to wear like a mask like a it's not mandatory ya
it wasn't it wasn't
mmhmm
true we're not taking care of our own earth
mmhmm
true
right the icebergs are melting the world are rising
right
so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
influential that's that's it
mmhmm
ya
mm
as long as it doesn't affect our daily food
what we have to care about it
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay speaking of which if you have
um
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life
you know let's say the world is not doing good anymore and all like okay we have enough for everybody first one could be but we only supplying this amount of food this type of food for you
for the rest of your life
ya for the rest of your life
I cannot
either meat or spaghetti
ya like
steak
ya steak
you know
we can cook like
we can fry it we can like
boil it
ya
can boil it
make it into a soup or something
you know it could be bland but it still feels like at least I'm eating something you know
you know
kan
that's a sad meal
that's what we have to eat for the rest of our lives
okay
okay now speaking of food right speaking of food
let's say I bring you over to a restaurant
named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
you get what you do
comes around
so if if if I were to bring you to that restaurant
and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
mmhmm
ya
but why
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
um
mmhmm
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
mmhmm
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be um maybe um answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if um I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be um
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody um ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
when we look down uh
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
um perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
mmhmm
mmhmm
why would you this is a
mmhmm
ya
ya me too I mean
right
mmhmm
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you mean
ya people would be like oh my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
mm
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually uh a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
mmhmm
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
mmhmm
it's bad
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
um eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
just health ya mm ya true cause
partner
oo wow
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause um you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
uh they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as um healthy being um happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like oh I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if um
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
um like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
mmhmm

or house
ya ya ya just only one
or house
is that what you're working towards to now
mmhmm
of course it does everything needs money
mmhmm
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
mmhmm
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know um
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know

kan ya ya ya true true true true
I don't know
the Seoul Garden hotpot
err I'm not sure I don't know how they cook it ah

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life
ah
yes
yes our wedding

be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow eh

just for the sake of
ah getting err
cheaper cheaper price ah kan

we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore

yes ah
kuta beach ah
it it is the way they set up the kuta beach
is like trying to follow gold coast ah so it's like this one is gold coast

the cleanliness of the beach

ah can click kan a'ah
ah
ah mmhmm
ah
malaysia ah
a'ah
yes ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
older lah ah older
but the penang one could have been better cause if not raining
four families cut down to three ended up to two kan ah
ah
if there is a travel restriction
ministry of foreign affairs will be alert
and they will say
ah advise people not to go there ah a'ah
yes
I enjoy the food down there
ah
home of P ramlee
penang yes
ah ah
ah
ah like very interested to talk to to us eh ah
ah
ah yes that one is the the tower
ah ah ah eh they say what
they emphasise as the biggest
the biggest curve
in southeast asia
ah it's the biggest
ah
ah scared of heights ah
ah
but if I yes
ah
ah that time the new attraction they haven't finish doing yet ah the new attraction they
you can be you can I think you can do flying fox a short
flying fox lah then outside the building
that one they haven't finish yet ah I think if that one already have I think you can forget it about raja going on it lah ah
that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah
a'ah
ah ah shopping centre
ya lah ah
kan ah disposable shoes disposable clothes then
okay so other than travel
ah in year twenty twenty one lah kan lah what would be
your wish your hope in twenty twenty one
mm
ah primary two hopefully he will do better than in primary one
ah
mmhmm mmhmm yes
family members ah ah
so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah
a'ah
ah
eh lah
a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application
ah
ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then ah
I think now is
ah
involved ah uh huh
ah do the best that he can be ah
enjoy enjoy what
ah make try to make his life ah
meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah
ah ah
a'ah
a'ah

but the funny thing is
my boss said that
um
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
a moment later you're there changing the
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
homework
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
torturing so
a lot of people
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
like
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay lah I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
oh ya I did oh my god I miss her so much um
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and ah I met man the house so so empty
and
and ya lah
and all that ya
but
I don't know I'm happy for her
ya that's like
I mean like
nowadays um
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not forced upon it
not
find it you know once you stop finding for it then things
come
ya that kind of thing
but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right
how long eh how long eh
oh my
god
oh my god that's really sweet
oh that's true
no
I don't
eh
every once a week
oh my god that's sweet
ah
but then my ex
err previously
he don't even remember
ya
so
I think he's called ex for a reason
mm
is it but are you the clingy type of person or like
I see
okay okay but like
I mean
mashallah I mean like
you know last long you know till
till married so wait okay
K
now I need to ask you important question
when
where is
when can I be a godma
okay lah I mean like we are still young and he is also still young he is in right so you get your freedom now
I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay lah take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
oh I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
um me and my family okay
I don't know eh I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have eh have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay lah slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
oh man
I saw this post and they said that um
the first child
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
um ya pass off so
but at the same time you you are nurtured
um
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third lah
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya lah are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
mm
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
um okay talking about sweet right
I scared leh I scared of diabetes
um
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
diabetic
his deserts you
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
oh my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high lah
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
mm
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
you save so much
one to two days
wah this is
is quite hard
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
her
grandfather
and then drove back home
and left him there
malaysia lah
singapore
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then um they receive a phone call from the dad um the dad call another lah his son lah another son
then went there
and he said the father said okay me home lah then then they say like oh it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good leh
because
of um
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so ah
how old is she now
but the around
oo
I think more the the the the over sixty five lah
definition of
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
oo that I like the question mm
um I
think kan I would
probably would love
love
to
just
um
around
okay ah
paris area
london because
is it so rushing
I have heard a lot of people saying that
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know um
ya lah but that's my goal lah
just
ya you how about you
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit lah
it's just too fast pace but
but
ya lah
and like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control kan
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
mm
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated what
in certain way
but
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good lah
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
like
eh okay
but like
ya lah
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
oh I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so um and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
meant to be
that's why I believe lah so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
oh man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
then I
kept up
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
wah a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
oh my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
intake
but inshallah
I mean like you can I can lah I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya lah you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can lah
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major what minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare what
why not
oh ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
eh I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
but
okay lah I mean there are so many expectations of us
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
but
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about lah
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
I don't know like
okay like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like oh
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
ah okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like ah rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like
like usually you Netflix
wow
wow I barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
oh my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
oh is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
oh I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
but like okay lah I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like uh
okay lah funny but eh quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
oh that's so sweet
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
I can't like I don't have self control
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright oh my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya lah I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely oh my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
eh the younger one
eh wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
oh are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya lah I
I mean I love four
but overcook is fun
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya lah I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
you will get
more
than what you save
hundred K
I mean it's quite
reassuring lah to know that
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it lah
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay
we should

what do you think of young marriages or arranged marriages
hit me
uh okay let's say ha
okay err as young as eighteen
child before marriage so you are saying eighteen years old is like a child still a child
oh
ah bad image like that ah
mm
mm
true true
okay then err let's see if err they are they are married already then after that um they they are not stable
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like oo got so so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
ah but they're not stable yet ah like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now
what are your thoughts
oof
okay
okay focus on marriage first ah would you allow your children to do that
mm okay
true okay
in singapore
oh okay
like agree
ah ah
mm
mm
mm
ya he's the one that kind of thing ah
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway kan
ah
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
uh if let's say like err you you get into a relationship already ah then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
ah
okay okay
mm
okay
play around you
mm
huh
they call it off for eight years' oh
eight years oh my the fact that you actually drop so easily ah the eight years
ah
ah
interesting ya
aiya
ease sia
ah I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future lah you know
yes sia
oo wah
mm
true true okay ah
okay we are
next year is our third year ah
mm
true true
that's basic adult things ah adult marriage things you know ya like oh we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at ah
but ya lah like what you say ah it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
mm
mm
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you ah to me ah because honestly being this old
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya sia actually true and it's workaholics
I mean people different err different mindset lah ah
mm
it's true oh my god that one that one is a major issue in singapore sia like money is such
money just plays a big part eh in singapore
okay lah I mean
okay ang moh err
mmhmm
mm
true ya ya ya okay lah it is
actually err okay when I was in kan everything there was so slow
like I have to get in if not cannot sia late for err late for work you know that kind of thing
ah
ah
a lot of people coming in ah and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
ya dead rich but the point is like
err very late very like um she said that
singapore's err healthcare is the best
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like err singapore is number one lah for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this ah
web for err what's that called
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like err this one is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this one got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another one is ya no lah I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then um I don't know lah a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no oh my god you know healthcare is so bad lah
is so bad
ah ah ah
I okay come on lah singapore is
err accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every err town area and then that kind of thing ah correct but in if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands lah it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore lah basically
so ya there are okay lah as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given lah
so
oof
ya hor
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
bedok jetty changi you know ya
so I guess this I understand lah why the government is building all this
ah we are we are not an enemy to anybody
to me it was like
true ya
that's true that's right
ah that one that movie
ah and ya and ya ya lau pa sat
oh is it it's true ah
oh I didn't know leh
oh

this month lah ya ya ya this month I remember it was earlier this month sorry lah
we visit should have
ya but I I saw like
they have very little stuff like um maybe like three at the counter they okay actually they have a lot of staff tau
and then they needed like people who do food food and drinks
so I saw like
then oh got wider go beyond they got to ah so err twenty then
a'ah
ah
so they have more people lah actually but it's just that it's very little like uh one each
but it's extra work
you know it's extra work
but I always go when there's the double deal the we buy fifty get hundred dollars
that hundred dollars that you know when the ya I'm always up to date okay I
ya I'm always up to date okay I love Timezone and I got so many points
ya
but then
ya speaking of that
did you see the one of the ministers suggests that singaporeans like they if they want they they can take second jobs seh
aiyo is not the east coast lah laila ah
mm
mm
ya
true
ah ya
ish woo woo woo chill
ya sia
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
but if okay lah let's say if err
even if we were to take this second job right how to okay for example we take you as an example no we take you as an example okay you work six days a week you know
where can you find time to slot in the second jobs sia
oof
Grab money come out more money come out what

oo right now ah right now okay lah like money lah money
being twenty three I have no time already eh okay I think if I'm twenty three and single I still have time ah

this is so interesting
you got like a a just mini celebrity of sorts with a niche following
ah
oh my god
oh my god ah
mm
corprate
ah
okay all right all right
ah ya
in some ways tiktok is like the wild wild west
ya

thank you
sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the um with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically um it's a K pop song by shinee
um ya so um so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny uh K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
oh okay okay uh maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called um um
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example uh
what what's the oh ya ya ya ya I know it's so true oh my god
eh nasha
ah I mean like that number ah the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so um like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
um because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily uh loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main um
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like err an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on uh any
uh any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
ah tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated oh I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize eh you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once uh once it realizes that eh this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin to see you
oh wow
oh oh wow amazing wow
grab ge</mandarin knows you but you don't know his name

mm
you want to try it out
then how do the other students like do they catch up or are they behind
like the first thing cause I would maybe I was to focus on like myself but I didn't notice the second it was fine because I was surrounded by jokers
oh right right right
something ya
just breathe what's the studio called by
oh right so I'd just
ah beat factory

ah
mmhmm
aww
do both right right right
so like one phone is like watching his live and the other phone is like your maples lah
hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching anime
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got saiki
the disastrous life of saiki
oh that's good
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like um slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called saiki um
like exploded
strength ah yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also uh teleport um
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole anime
ya it's just him
the whole anime revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep uh people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole anime he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
um you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
um I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like wow
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
oh ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
oh
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a gundam series on kids central
oh
ya
mm mm
yes yes
yes
mmhmm
ya
okay okay
mm
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact gundam I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
mmhmm
oh okay okay
hmm
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into gundam and you're like no
gundam
ah it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now um
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet lah correct
um so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
ah no I think it's still with aisyah okay nevermind that's fine
ya so um
I I told her like eh sorry ah I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would um
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch um
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw ah I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya um it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze um there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends lah or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is err five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really um topics that you don't understand like uh explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because um
I like to read like I like tea you know to um
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their um comments is always oh this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad lah I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
oh ya so back to ah so um so I asked her like uh can you give like uh
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere lah and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
izz can easily catch up eh
ah okay lah not bad lah
oh yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
mm
ah
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
oh okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
oh my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
um this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with sha it was after A levels
um I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about uh this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
um came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian um
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this um spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
wow really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was um a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and uh so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like oh I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you um
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
uh huh like nudity or sexual references uh ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending oh it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
mm
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like oh okay wow
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it oh my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya alah
ah right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
um this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya wey or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with haikyu she was really into haikyu her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that um but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance uh series
when I was younger lah when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
a'ah
it really impacted the way um I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so uh so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like uh thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out um it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial um like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like oh my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have uh this kind of like
uh ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
uh fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like um
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so tup tup they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so uh he was looking for her
a'ah
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like um like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like oh my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay lah when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything um
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
ha it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean um the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with uh starting mira filzah and if you know adi putra
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first mira filzah was twenty four seven
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult lah logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head ah ah
the instant ha instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid um commercial shampoo commercial

mmhmm
okay I can recommend you

among us among us
ya you said like that it's among us
I don't know eh I feel like this type of thing ya obviously
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya he's he's a very soft guy
which is good but sometimes not good because
ya exactly
then I feel like it's pointless lah honestly I mean I don't mind giving him advices so that he will be aware of like whatever that is gonna happen that he have never experience before but at the same time if
a bit tiring lah can say
cause I know that he will still love me even I look ugly or what
dress up a lot and I wear makeup a lot then
think four
four fifty
about there lah
ya
I feel like that's why ah
and like I don't know why I don't see the point of
oh like that okay lah
mm mm oh oh
a'ah
okay okay
oh ya
light light festival ya
scare khine
I don't know and I was quite shock that she actually told me eh oh really ah oh ya ya that one I told you right that was quite good eh good acting girl
oh my gosh damn I miss being in the same class as you sia stupid
I cannot be friend I cannot like someone when that someone is my friend
ya
but I really like our friendship sia it's really quite unexpected sia honestly
honestly I didn't really want to make friends so with anybody because every semester I have to change class do you think it will work

okay
ya okay okay got it
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing lah once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
hmm send it to her
you name it lah they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a sham day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
ah guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got ah and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
eh I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like um if you want me you know where to find me ah then we can hang out
ah I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing lah but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is ah
ah
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move lah
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got iskandar is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big err when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
to do with the two of them yes yes
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
they flocked to her ah all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah ah ah
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
fuck lah she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
okay
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with tini what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
yup
alamak
uh huh
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with tini
she didn't know either okay got it
ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was tini first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
okay
ah
ya ya ya ya ya okay
then she come down for what
ah ah ah ah
right
ah ah ah
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions lah ya ya ya
ah that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause tini was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but tini felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him ah it sounds like it like like tini really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
mm
when there are friendly things you don't reciprocate ya
mm
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
okay
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this lah ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful lah when how she speaks lah
yup yup yup yup yup yup
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down lah it's like that lah sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes nisa likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how nisa does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as nisa but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
I I really think that's missing ah in schools ah how to politely draw line you know
ah ah correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
ah ah ah ah
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then err then continue lah but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
err
oh okay okay okay
oh okay so there is a possibility he might come is it oh okay cool
ah eh I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording ah
oh oh ya dude we were just talking about you
or maybe he has left okay
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad um but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this sia I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
huh natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
huh I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank sia
like steamboat ah oh inside the tank got aircon
singapore
as long as I got my aircon
okay ya so I saw all that but then I think later on in the day I saw one facebook video of like tank it was quite surreal the tank go past but the the guy whose job it is to kill people with this tank is just waving very happily I'm like wow this isn't what I'm paying my soldiers for you know who ask you to wave
ah okay but can't see it ah
ya ya ya ya ya
oh that's cool
I was working that night mm mm
err
ya I don't know why cause ya it was interesting it was just so uneventful
err if you could
oh god I completely forgot all the questions I don't know what they want
memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in bali it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story ah from start to end and then at each point for each dish
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head
okay
oh
ah
ah ah ah oh my god then you just take the whole thing ah ah ah
ah
don't break don't break
yup
and wah
yes it's the moments ah saffron ah saffron
ah ah ah
ya ya ya
I can imagine
I have a direct bus to tampines here not even at the interchange you know
one two seven
could be yup
ya ya ya
tampines ya got
so that's the end station in mind
ya zoo is ang mo kio lah ya ya ya
ya that used to be my commute wah and another way that I used to commute was how ah oh no this one is when I go home time I take from the zoo but then I stop somewhere along thomson road upper thomson there then I take a bus down I walk there I come down to braddell braddell view then I walk home ah
it was a nice walk home
today is
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
accordingly lah cause I will be putting in a lot more work um then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this kan
I want to lie in bed and watch
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently ah not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood ah
then it doesn't help that my stupid boils keep happening
and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal
that took awhile
okay cool
ya also I provided an update about my current job hunt tight situation
oh um
I I don't remember one
oh if people didn't have to work what would they do right
okay so this is
ah actually it is I like this things
like I I if I really had money right then I didn't have to worry about food then I would I don't know then maybe I might be asked to cook cause I know I can buy whatever ingredient I want for example you know
an issue ya
ah ah ah ah ah
correct correct correct exactly
ya correct the info is all there and we know it it's
correct
correct correct
ah ah ah ah ah
ya
yup yup yup yup
doing this sort of things
ah correct correct maybe finally have a ant farm
don't know leh I mean if if I feel like maybe not sure or what I got questions then maybe I can call ryan
hi ryan ya his name is ryan so beautiful
I could see all the other mums over there were all like hyperventilating man
coach her ah
his name is ryan and he works at the ant museum at katong for little while he was the favourite of all the mothers
mm mm
so confidently
ya he had a very good err speaking persona unlike unlike his other there's one other colleague girl I think was quite good
but there was know there was one guy that I was like like making serious enquiries lah about how much actually is it gonna cost me to come up with my own anterrium and all these and he was
a bit like don't really answer the question and will roam the point a bit before getting into it be like oh okay
of course
but of course
you think he knows
okay
ya I think it's no more it was extended for awhile but I'm very sure COVID would have closed it lah it's too small and too um
ah ah ah ah
oh okay okay okay then get into it like damn obsessively and do terrariums that are like artistic
I think those books ruin a lot of young women you know
I don't know they were fun haiya I definitely went through a period of them I even use to shoplift them these romance novels ya man but then you know what I do or not will take out and then put the ones I took the last time
I don't know why I went through a phase in secondary school ah it's a bit punk I supposed property is theft um
yup
party eh
got sex one ah
oh specifically ya okay okay okay
okay okay okay
okay okay okay ya I've heard it I've heard it for sure I just wasn't completely sure
code words ah ah ah ah this is like codeswitching within codeswitching
matrep ah ah
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah
right
ah ah ah ah
yup yup
oh
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
oh
oh
ah
ah
ah
oh camouflage ah
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya yup yup
to make it more obvious right
right
yup
right
I never knew marsiling was okay okay okay
oh
ya ya ya
right okay okay
there's a lot of looking ah
ah
ah
oh my goodness what an experience for them
yup
yup that's very nice
true true true true
correct correct
correct they grow up in a very different world ya
yup I think they are more open to new things they don't have prejudgements as much as us ya ya
that's so cute ah ah ah
ya
right okay
yup
yup
yup
these kids ah
ya how beautiful what a gorgeous story
ya ya ya ya
so a lot of brown people step forward lah as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying ah sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
had it right but no lah the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know
sundilah
ah
that was really weird and and tone deaf I thought this this election got a lot of things that were tone deaf ah from the side
firm that may not have I don't know many people that are representatives I don't know man
people's voice kan
ah ah
I see I see I see
ya ya ya ya
your vote now
ya I don't think it matters
for singapore supporting the government cause of covered walkways
sundilah it's one hour
okay then one two three

I'm planning to lik
two lah because the um the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle lah early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before lah ah
err so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
err
so it doesn't make sense lah to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
ah the one definite lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take lah bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first lah it's either my side or his side lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern lah
um
oh it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
chey
err they have catering they have decoration with including the err plumbing also and then err they include the door gift
and then err tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford lah if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off mah so like err very proud you know finally you know somebody err my my child is getting married or whatever but the
alah they don't know the the cost to get tha
err there's no need for any vehicle lah I mean there's only just need one way lah just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
ah that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that ah want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum lah like come lah to meet me and give me advice lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity kan because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
uh manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west lah so uh it's not a location that is suitable for wedding lah it's more to like education wis
ah so err they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so um no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
ah so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that uh
became because of that also one good thing lah I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore err
ya lah the week after the wedding lah she will do that means like I think mayb
within december lah she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know lah as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift lah to the bride side is i
is it err oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
err so is there a magazine is through Facebook lah so this lady was cheated and um you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing lah and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically kan you need to have okay ah for example like that that that particular location at orchard err it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that oh if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people lah ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course lah about thirty dollar plus plus and then leh I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like oh asia's err hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company lah not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then uh there was one time err the package includes brida
you compared the price of each eh to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
um we will only book one event for one da

if your job is just that you you also would do it what like looking forward to it
if no money
if no money

sia ah
so it's all about you
want to
disrupt other people's family or what then you know their plans
but still
then
eh then then okay then if example eh
then imagine if papa want to pass away then she then he have to pass down or whatever shit
if have to pass down to females we are the only two
I don't know
male female
then would you take it
if it if they have to pass down to female
then that means I have to take it
why
why can't you sacrifice for me
why can't you sacrifice for me
half half
no should take like
on
on even weeks
of the year follow me on odd weeks of the year follow you
ya
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places what
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when um they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
except for me
then after that
a veranda
out on level two or level three then we were just there sitting to smoke first ah before going down back because the place was like super horrible with a lot of broken glasses and such
then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung uh
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
no eh they were asking me black figure then I was like no like it's you can't blame me there's two other
people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh
I don't know
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
eh no he got nine wives so so I you be ten then I'll be eleven
no the lina's cafe is not his it's one of his wives
I don't want to
number eleven is more prettier than me
marriage
they can only stare at you
because I can't help you
why I don't know ah

later they google aqilah great figure
eh uh
how old nineteen years old
and she's not even plastic excuse me not like kardashian

mm
really meh
no they said there's a reason for that because of the underwear you use also

lucky we got one spare box of mask so we give him one
this chilli it's
it's too hot
then the japanese man was like sweating profusely already and he was already so drunk he can't even walk straight anymore
because japanese is known for their wasabi what

so
so I ask you a question
okay so nabilah how was your day
nice ya talking about it right
like I totally forgot about it I was like
resting
then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it lah I was like
oh the is still trying to convince me to like um for her
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
we're going out at one
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
then I fell asleep
freaking six ya
busy you know cause okay
family members kan
then
err
but my another
dress patterns lah the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
kan
so
the first thing I did was
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and err and then like uh I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was
no one was attending to me ah so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it lah
ya
ya
hello
that's call cheat
ya
small kan
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
like while I was
bathing
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that kan
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that huh like the the motor and the and the cars are like
ya
ya
mmhmm
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
mmhmm
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with irfan zahidah
once every
twice a month or something
huh
oh ah
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
yes
like it's quite
like hats off to them lah
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay kan
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
it looks very
you know some some sets you know that it's a set kan
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
err
it's really
oh my god uh I cannot uh my brain is like fried it's really impressive lah
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big lah in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
mmhmm
mm
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
mm
mm
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts lah hor
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
eh buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
mmhmm
ya ya
makes sense food
ah aiya okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
so the reason why it's
and then
one for one specs lah like at at that point of time I was like thinking
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free lah for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so um
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
err
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument eh discussion between me and my
like we were like
like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that lah but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
I don't know
and
it all
like
ya
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures pe ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
err
if you see ah the people who who buy glasses from owndays kan they also keep on changing their glasses
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
glasses um spectacle shops are following following it lah
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that kan usually ah specs
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try lah so that they can sanitise kan
and then
I was looking at like other customers ah and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know ah
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
mmhmm
a'ah ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also ah the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also lor I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
mm
ya
oh my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
oh ya talking about it
ya
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you sia I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like oh my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
like writing
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it lah ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype kan
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing lah like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like huh why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
mm
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual lah
and their self control I guess
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
huh
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised lah cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into lah to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
mm
uh huh
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting lah cause like
they keep on
giving you
different um
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing lah
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
mmhmm
wow
uh huh
maybe that's why you've been seeing jufri
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like

mmhmm
ya
also cause I go post

an idea of like what
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
ee I hate guys like that
uh huh like
ah
mmhmm
ee
and and the thing is
each like
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
ah
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
mmhmm
like even if they don't have
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
oh or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like oh you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that lah ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
about himself
no lah I'm pretty sure you will find someone lah
maybe maybe not a muzmatch cause like I get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
mmhmm
oh my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay I say I say that that's shallow right but I'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height
like
did I tell you
did I tell you
when I when I moved to telegram kan
ah he asked me lah oh what's your height
then I was like one six three you
and then
he was like I'm one six one
then me
his height in feet I forgot how much is it ah
then I then I calculated
and then when he said he was one six one right I was like oh
okay smiley face and then
and then he was like I'm joking
then I was like ah
and then I whenever now like
now now whenever like we go out like sometimes we will talk about it then I was like I can't believe you lied to me about it then he was like
if if I was really one six one what what would you do then I was like
I I I don't know
I mean I will still talk to you but then like I will feel betrayed because you you lied about your height
ya it's so funny
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya I know how it feels
legit
ya
maybe like
other girls
ya other girls did it
ya
oh my god it's it's a technique I use to like make myself look smaller
but mine isn't bottom up because bottom up will make me look like super tall
so it's just like
is like that so I look slim
ya
oh my god remember what happened where we were trying to take your
photo
ya
uh huh
hmm
that is so me
ya
thank god
he
thank god he's really one eight one
if not I'll be like I mean
you know just now
so it has like platforms
then I look down
then I was like
mm I wonder how
I wonder if this is how aryan sees me
because like the height was like this
then I look at her
then I was like hmm and then she was like
then
and then she was like
she was like don't do that
then I was like why
then she's like
double
so she's like who are you
ya I should
that's how he takes my photos and then I'll look so fat and short
ya
hmm that's true
what did sarah text you
oh
ah

wow mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
ah yes
ya lah we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya lah
ya so I think what we can do we don't go uh we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual lah we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in ah
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay lah uh we can take the the voucher ah you want to buy the voucher ah meaning we have to go uh the
err
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course ah
no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya
ya K lah can we will
tell that to the
to the boy tomorrow
ah
okay lah so at least we have
so if let's say he okay

when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump I'm like oh god okay I'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
oh my god they can
oh damn damn
ya I think I was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when I look at it the alligator like the biggest thing I've seen in the tank like super huge to me
I was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and I will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause I didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now oh there's where we feeding the alligator come down oh no cause I was like run back down
mengheadache
err
chey
hmm
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in pulau ubin or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
ah there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
mm
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode
ya so
I just
so one day when she's going to macritchie I got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
pulau ubin
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no eh
uh oh no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
because he's very sneaky you know I assume it's a he lah I don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
so I'm just going to like okay I just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bottle water away
mmhmm
okay
alright
oh
mmhmm
mmhmm
what the heck
okay
alright
oh
oh my god
oh my god
ah ya ya ya
mm mm mmhmm
it's crazy
oh my god
oh my god
what do you do
wah this teacher scold
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
ears
okay
uh huh
ah
mm mm
uh huh uh huh
to whack ah uh
oi
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really ah
I went I went ostrich farm
then
ah
they don't really like um sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
uh huh
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have leh
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
mmhmm
oh
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous ah
now cause
oh my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
oh what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve sia
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else ah food err shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
mm
mmhmm
they have the
assertion
two weeks
mm higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know lah what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was ah
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself lah he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
kan
ah
uh huh
same ya
phase two
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think the annoying part is like okay ah aside from business lah like how the work function now is
so um
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment ah rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible lah
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course err because of your work function ah but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office oh
it depends on your work already mah
ya
ya
mm
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings ah weddings most affected ah
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
err but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective lah who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person ah that kind of thing ah but also she can't be very
restrict lah about two who would potentially can be invited
um
it's just err sad lah didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
yup
mmhmm
ya
um hmm
ya must come to terms lah
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth eh it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
it's the best thing for them lah
social media the next thing ah
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
I'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on Facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
kan but okay what do you what do you what do they normally watch
old songs
me watch

oh okay
oh okay
mm
ya lah
not really
mm
oh okay
ah
I see
not really ah
so far was sam willows jer ah sam willows I I hear
and then after that
that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah
oh why ah
wasted kan
medicine also medicine what
oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
al-azhar lah
then
mmhmm
oh really
okay then
okay
how come it's like that ah
okay then how about
oh
if it's not recognize then because she she don't want to take
and then the the mother wants her to take right
but now after COVID after COVID she
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's actually quite
quite sad lah
cause the amount because there's some
ya I mean that's quite
unfair lah but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end err she should've finish already right
uh why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya lah I mean
mm but
it's kind of sad lah that that wani that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity lah but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good lah that you know
huh really

that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system

it's like you know like the survival of the fittest lah
ya ya he say err work hard or work in mcdonald's
understood understood understood
ah
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay err honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's ah we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly um
K initially err this is like my third err application to you know ah sorry should I should not mention the name lah
um
almost to like a nine K eh err nine K of err school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
when it comes to studies wise err
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of err I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ah
so and then I saw in err semester three I told myself no I cannot
and then my my results was alhamdulillah I mean I I was quite surprised ah that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten lah
and then err I remember sitting with this err with this lady lah she is err from penang you know she no no I I I went penang sorry ya I went penang and then I was on my way back from penang to singapore via flight so there was this err lady that I I sat beside and then err
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say err excuse me err then err then so when I enter err and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me eh you singaporean ah
ya you can tell ah you can tell from a from a
yes it's it's different and then um then she was asking she was telling me lah
err every everyone is kind of like taken care of lah I would say I mean I do not know I mean I I I've been staying there for like almost err three three three years plus now err it's good ya it and err I find that
I want to stay in malaysia or not I tell you
provided I'm earning a lot in singapore then I will stay in malaysia
understood
yes yes yes yes
yes it doesn't make sense for me
ah understood
and they they even say it like my malaysian even say my malaysian friends lah even say like is a expensive city to live in
like if you go other city or other states is much more cheaper when it comes to the items and everything so you got me thinking lah oh
ya
understood understood understood
but at but we never have anything to begin with
or also known as tanned
err he ask me eh you go kedah
ah
I mean err I did visit my friend lah in kedah lah in one way or another lah but this that that part
the almighty you know in the other life
but
but I always tell him lah like eh you cannot you know so back to my err double life so ya lah I mean at the err
and then
I am planning to do my internship in singapore because at the end of the day I'm going to come back and and work here
yup
understood
yup yup
err whether I want to go into teaching whether I want to go into academics or whether I want to go into err media I still haven't decide lah I mean
so I will say lah in the next err one and a half years start starting from october

wish eh
then for you
three months
oh like how is it
twice a week
ah not bad lah
oh you met the the mum
okay
ya lah
uh
mm
eh
right
oh okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that lah I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your um
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet ah
but for you
mm
uh
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive kan then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare ah
oh
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
tuas tuas
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow uh uh seh
clubhouse
okay
oh okay but it such a weird place lah to like get a get married at uh at tuas
ya I mean if you're up for pulau tekong kan
like I'm if you're if you're up for pulau tekong you're up for pretty much anywhere seh but I think you don't want sentosa right sentosa is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
oh ya you just book the cruise lah you just get one cruise uh uh
then you get married in the on the water
uh
uh uh seh
like like go all out lah
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
uh mocktail lah mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
uh huh
oh nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
oh okay okay okay
mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh
brunch menu mm
mm
okay lah best lah
mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

I've been doing well lah actually what about you
wah actually it was not bad leh like uh at first
uh I thought like I'll have a lot of problems but actually it was quite smooth
Law and Literature so ya very interesting
then uh you in what school now
a'ah
oh so uh what course
oo that's interesting
mm
mm
mm
true
then
mm
um floorball
ya it's a very interesting sport
oo then what type of sport do you prefer then
mm
mm
hmm
alamak
eh
mm
mm
then
mm
it's a unique course I would say
ya and err this course is like it appeals to me lah because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
mm
oo so
oh so recently I just uh finish my semester one so some of the courses I sorry I mean modules I picked was
I did was uh design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also uh besides coding I also learn uh concept
oo that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship eh
oh
true
oh
oh
wah
like during that that test
oh right
mm
oh
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well lah
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
ah
mm
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally uh do uh my hobbies
yeah
yep
go for the trials err because I um I'm actually afraid of rejection
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then um so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
wah how was it
yeah
oh for what
oh
mm
ah
yeah
mm
oh
wow
ya man I can't imagine myself
wah all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
then
uh other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so uh how
oh
yeah
I
eh then oh
eh you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
ah small business
no no no you you meant ah calligraphy is it
oh yeah yeah
yeah eh
mmhmm
ih
oo
wah wah tell me more
yup
list them all
oh
oh
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
true
ya
ya
ya true true
wah for me right
yes
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
wah I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator eh with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
oh
mm
ya uh me also like most of the time is always like cause I
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
uh it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design kan so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm uh ideas together and then come up with like uh a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting lah because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
uh how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you eh
mm
why kay you tell me
how rabak
wah I legit also don't like this type of people leh like they really make my blood go up eh like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to ah take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works lah
mm
oh
oh I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
oh
oh that's interesting
ah ya ya
mm
oh that's good that's good
yeah
oh
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app ah because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good um for me I think your app is very beneficial lah for people yeah
oo that's good
ya ya ya very interesting eh
mmhmm
mm
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
wah
that's cool
mm
wah
ya ya ya very interesting
oh
oh
ya
mm
mm
ya ya
mm
and what are some of the
the like
oh ya
ya
wah actually I make friends very instantly eh it's like ya because err okay the good thing about technology is that err
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school lah so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya
you eh what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
wah my one don't have eh cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad leh
oh
huh really ah
oh
oh I see I see
oh
mm
I I think not bad leh the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time um my I had I had this uh program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours lah then you will get the
it was so hot
ya
ya
mm
right
wah
ya
really ya it is
oh ya ya I've done the morning shift one before it's very very tiring
ya
oh maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad lah this COVID there ah spoil all the plan eh then like legit man then ah spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
mm
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

okay
so
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
okay
why it is sad like
like ah okay
oh
ah
oh
oh
ah oh
wah
but then how ah like
ya
why so weird
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
oh
uh huh
uh huh
what
but that's really your favourite movie
wah
err
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show oh then ah my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
um they suddenly
um
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
all of them I think almost all of them get married
ya
kan like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young lah so the thing is like he's err like professor in this like
like um over the years kan they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like ah people who are like basically like
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met ah through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
um you know like straightaway
like realise eh tomorrow you gonna get married this person
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world lor
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing lah that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool kan I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker lah don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
oh
oh ya you told me what
oh ya ya the cafe thing then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh
wah
oma spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
farrer park ya but the thing is
very circular
actually ya
uh huh
like tough what
but you know
ya but it's not
ya
eh
ya
maybe you are just like picky
tea without sugar can but coffee oh because of the bitterness kan
it's just weird
K lah okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
you can fulfil lah okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so um out of these three kan like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay lah have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
lee kuan yew no ah is it you can be rich I can't remember
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know what
what
okay I think that's a bit far oh
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
mmhmm
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries lah our neighbouring countries lah
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries lah if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore ah no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
like you know
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun kan
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case lah
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot lah hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is eh you know the train one
oh my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay lah um
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
no but maybe maybe because like
what you doing there huh uh you never read the sign is it
eh ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like oh my god
like ah like the maid was shocked lah when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya because it's okay lah but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
um you need to
like you can achieve now lah I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy lah to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
huh
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and uh cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia ah and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya lah but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary ah
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya
so can use that
err if it there's one country my wish list lah
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young lah I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like naruto like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing lah last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly naruto come in ya ah pokemon all this you know and then I was like
oh my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
wah
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like osaka kyoto tokyo
and I when nara I went like kanazawa then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no lah I went with my friend but I went um I think I went hiroshima alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter eh wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing lor
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like tokyo and osaka they rarely snow I think
tokyo ya tokyo rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
oh you didn't know I went korea oh my god
I showed you ya
oh my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only ah it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have ah thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no lah I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
wei you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition mah
ya
no lah um I think K because
most of them lah actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so uh it's their first language lah english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
um you know the seoul tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya wei you didn't know I went all these wah it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also lah that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper what
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in temasek my microsoft
korea bought my bags mah
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
ya
oh you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
huh
I feel like going with your friend kan
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went batam with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like oh no I cannot eat it's oh no like this place is
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
oh ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage lah
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment err one star price then I was like
alamak why you like that
and then um
then then I was like
ya then okay
so okay how about you which country you would like to go
korea
I I'm looking at cause you cannot run what unless you wanna join like fun did you
but korean got nothing much though
eh yo yo america
there's so many things
okay lah but
but you've been to europe turkey was in europe
ya but it is europe
it it they are part of europe
they look you know you know you went to like turkey and then there's they have like the greece infrastructure and everything it looks exactly the same
you know right like you the whole europe have that same infrastructure that you see
ya
but europe is
I think for me is quite boring unless you go like paris
um
yes sightsee
drink coffee
no drink tea you don't like coffee

I think afal entertain you
ya right he will entertain you like
cause of school what you also will be busy next year after you know I don't know it depends where you go

very difficult
ya
but it depends lah if you think it's fulfilling then you should go for it
no but it's not easy
but it's stable

you talk with gibberish you just talk stupid stuff
oh I always do that
no really like sometimes I for me right I don't go out because I feel like if I go out I spend I'm not even close with them then like and then you
ya
cancel
what time

real friends
so it yesterday they are not real
eh when you will get your result
thirty first
wah it's so long eh aren't you scared
when
oh my god
I remember the first when I got my O level result I was like okay I could have done worse you know like I was quite shocked that it's still good
ya
cause I didn't study
you mean what
no I didn't study
ah
ya
but okay lah
actually still enough time lah
ya it's quite fan</mandarin
then you get like like small allowance
huh she's paying fine
like really fine
huh
ya but you will care about money soon enough really
like what
oh
ya but
oh I get it like she's
doing something in your life
no lah maybe because like they are like old thinking you know it's like when they are younger they they rather just stay at home then cook learn how to cook ah that but now is different mah
wah
oh that's nice
I like beef boat noodles
oh ya we've been to thailand also
you went with your friends
only oh chey I thought
how much is it

ya
I thought it would be more expensive
ya I know I know it's like
I know I know they have that like they have that malaysia mah but malaysia one super cheap it's like one ninety ringgit eh
ya
I also never tried before
no but you have to know that they are old
you know like they don't
cause she likes spicy then K fry also spicy
ya so she don't really eat the cheese

mukshidonna

it's like a lot of is it
she's not really busy
nonsense lah
okay so
ya
K K K
then last okay okay it's like oh my god it's almost like one hour eh K maybe okay we ask one last question K one last question time to sleep
ya
but okay okay let's let me think of a good question to ask mm
if you were born rich okay if you were born rich singapore
then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no ah we're talking what
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail what if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting lah
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other kan
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between kan ya
mmhmm
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a suria actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
mmhmm
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no lah like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that I was like oh my god I found a website like no no not not no err because like I my friend bought the whole
I think ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me lah then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you ah like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never lah then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone lah ya I very independent
you know I have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true
huh
ya I know
why
no but the air cooler
but it's not even cold

like even if like it's it's like I I live with my army friends I will make sure like everything is in order unless I have to do work no I'm not a perfectionist lah unless work right you see so for me right I have like a space where I can be very messy
but then I will clean it up at the end of the night
ya
like it makes me happy to clean
therapeutic
ya
oh
wah
ya oh my god okay
so late
still early

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
oh ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right

just to be safe ah
job finding not so good lah still finding hundred plus going to two hundred jobs already rejected funny thing even temporary job also they don't want what to do
then
ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology
ya
it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree

ya the the the japanese wave shit then after that it's always like a koi fish going up and then after that the koi fish is at the forearm
seriously I
why do you think I saved up money for three years when I wanted to get tattoo

ah cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast lah
ya
I almost got a tattoo there
no I was planning it
and then after that just when we were there he
so and then
so I was like fuck it ah like
and when you come back we talk about it
then after I googled do

ya
ya
no lah she know lah uh
I I stayed over at her friend's house of course she know
no
it's just
me
like I
ya I mean
one time I literally passed out
on the living room
yeah
I don't know ah
I I know at one point she she she didn't
yeah
ya never again though
yes
throwing up
no
yeah
ya
ya I did it was like one of the first few conversations we had
cause she asked about halal haram ratio
then I said oh ya I I I used to drink a lot and stuff
ya
cause she said
ya uh I stopped already so okay lah that doesn't bother her
that kind of thing like that
ah
what
ya then happened like three
in the same night
and then after that
no I don't I don't remember
ya
that as
ya and then one time
then after that
then after that you know like they dance very close one
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
that one I remember
I I was so angry at myself sia
ya
I mean I feel kind of bad but
also kind of
good
ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
uh huh
mmhmm
ah
ah okay
action sia
I
oh
ah
hand over shift
reservist
actually not really lah I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
mm
mm

for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning kan
ya
last time my rota quite bonded ah
ah that's like fucking eight bicycle sia
mm
oh ya how was it cardiac arrest right
ah
cannot sia
mm
dah expect ah
mm

ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
ah
mm depends ah depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
oh
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
oh
why sia
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
mm
ah
that's cool
the this captain from
err division yishun
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
ah
ya
err they started right after I
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also

like to turn to lah in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels

he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think err that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he um he is he intends to go uni ah because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it will be a very rewarding experience
education ah
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity uh to have to access err to access uh all these various uh resources I think it will be nice lah for everyone ya not saying that err the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools lah I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do lah
mm
ya
in their head ya
equality versus
equality ah
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
oh if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
err
so you want the world to freeze the time

I don't know

I don't know if I got tell you before like I keep forgetting I think I told I told #Wati#</P2 or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in um
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like I think her brothers like ninety eight I think but then we are all in the same class so I'm just like so confused like like I ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say oh cause like
then
then I knew
I don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
the in Tampines
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
oh um this girl her name is #Aisyah#</P2 #Aisyah#</P2
Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2 we like
grow up together lah like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three
eh ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like I think you know eh it's like um
if me and
oh it's like if you and err
how to say ah

they have like the macam kids alive teens alive tweens alive
like
ya ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus lah then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session lah yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years #Aisyah#</P2 was
um
cause you mix class every time what so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
uh you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2 inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
yeah
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay meh then he said
yeah it's basically ya food related
but he listens to Malay songs now
okay so so this Camila</P2 girl right okay the chinese girl is named Kayla</P2 then this Camila</P2 girl she
um
um
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever lah then
then me and #Aisyah#</P2 went to

until like secondary school
I think girl girl
ya okay
bye

currently I haven't get my letter lah but
um
err
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me lah over good looks but
err
if I had to pick one then
how about you
err
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body lah but for good looks err if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it what so it's all down to genetics
err
err to fit body
err hopefully lah can you know live a healthier life and err not have any like
err
wah your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries um a bit more difficult to control lah especially if the country is very big right and
err maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason lah if let's say like scientists err cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this err
hunger and starvation maybe like
err people will like the population will eventually get reduced lah cause
um
if if this I mean don't know lah maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa lah of course other countries also you see the
mm ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
oh
mm err
I mean
better like not say change myself lah but like err how to say like relate to them and like
err whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly lah
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level lah
then maybe another skill would be like
err
like the kind err it comes together with like
err performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like um
err that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence lah I mean is err it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
err then
it's it's good lah in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards um
like
err
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just err accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said lah in the condition given is that
so like
err
increase my wealth from there lah whenever the stock market go up I can just err sell it if not I just hold on to it lah until the value is a good time to sell lah
ya
ya
for me ah probably
ability to teleport lah
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time lah like
even then like
is is not a problem lah you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower lah I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like err maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing lah that
err would would benefit like
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
err
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say lah with great power comes great responsibility kan so like
um
um
I feel like it's beneficial lah because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this err insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
mm
I mean
err I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
err whatever the case lah basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest err performance lah
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this err strong fit buff guy then
um
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be um
will come after you lah because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down lah like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then um
err just lay down in bed just like
like
um this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look ah like good like physical look
all err
they just err placed on me lah ya
okay lah
that's one but
um of course devote some portion of day to the person lah like
err partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
err going to work and all that then like
err I I still like to keep fit lah as I grow older so um
if possible
err
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
err athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing lah I feel like
err
very very important to you know err commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost lah but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person lah so that would be that would be ideal for me lah ya
err ya then
I feel lah that would be ideal for me lah because it's something I really enjoy and it
err
ya
but
err more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine lah ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
err
especially if it's like a a decently long ride lah
it takes time lah so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in err
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
err girlfriend lah ya

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where

what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review

is one thing that err can I ask err what is one thing that err really will make you feel annoyed like you what do you
ya
consider okay okay ya ya totally ya
okay
err ya of course I prefer err advanced planning so I don't like it when um err for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
err but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel um annoyed is when
err actually someone lied to me you know like um behind my back it's just really annoying
so um ya
err that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
okay
grow a lot older now we just err communicate through err

um over and over again especially during work working time or working hours or when I'm about to go to sleep that's the best time for me to listen to music ya ya
okay
ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true
actually
orh okay not that gore loud kind of thing lah okay okay
oh okay
okay
orh okay
right okay okay
I I saw somewhere
small service
oh
uh huh
oh okay
ah

okay I
mm
you know like start err and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
ya
ya
yes ya
ya right
ya and and
ya
yes ya so uh I mean twenty twenty eh to be honest has been such a tough err year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but um this year is like um very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like
ya
will that be your destination to your honeymoon consider lah okay
mm
okay
oh okay
okay
okay ya
ya new zealand new zealand
ya
cause I see like err
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
mm
okay
mm
oh okay so
correct
err I would love to err try out like the different kinds of
like um food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
okay previously kan err I was studying overseas kan so err it was such a
still prefer to um to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
oh okay
ya
autumn okay
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to um
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
oh okay
ya
mm
okay
oh ya
okay
have you tried
bullet train okay okay
I see
but ya
but it's okay um
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
but okay um
uh does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to err having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
err
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
um ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
okay
okay
mm ya
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
err you know I won't be scared of it but apparently uh ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
but how about um
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
mm
a bee stung ah
oh okay
ah okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
oh
did you shout
can you can you try to err you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
oh okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya oh no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
mm
ya
so um
ya
carry err
okay okay
okay
you tried
oh
huh in thailand
okay
mmhmm
cocoon
okay mm
because err some people always say that okay obviously um the
err obviously is like um the the the insects that is sold um for you to like can be consumed they say that it's err clean but you know it's clean um
but I still find disgusting even though like um they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to um to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
err you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
orh
ya
ya ya ya
oh ya maybe probably ya but um
very interesting to see like uh maybe you you know err like like even when um when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
err is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a um they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them kan the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically um I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get um halal food because mostly err they eat like
yup okay
so I mean err
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that um I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have err been jumping a lot of topics but it actually err
you know connects us our conversation to to speak err
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we um when we we we talk is always on err whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can err do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
um
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person kan so probably you might want to ask
oh so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it oh it isn't the latest lah the latest kan is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay err ya I mean err it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
more to the back
ya
oh okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung um err like err nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is um
the music err have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
okay
okay
that's that's uh that's good
oh ya I think um ya that's quite ya the downside of it lah I mean we we've been paying
quite a hassle because usually the normal kan but then ya

one eight seven
I don't want to like rush myself so I was just like okay never mind just take direct bus
one eight seven kan normally is the single deck right so
like there's no space right even if like the seat is very crowded
but this one I got like the double deck one
cause you always Grab here is it or you don't really have a purpose to come to jurong
uh huh
side lah
mmhmm
so what you just have to take the train and then you take a bus or you still like you have to switch buses
some more peak hours right I cannot sia like there was once I worked at at like I think
like it was just tiring I was just more tired I dreaded going to school I don't mind being in school but then like I just dreaded being in like going to school
like my makeup gets smudged at the mask and all that
mm
mmhmm
honestly yeah I can understand
what's your plan I mean like err I there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day
but uh I forgot
to I mean like I had I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
err like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
mmhmm
yeah like uh I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like err I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like um
you know the good vibes fest at um genting
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
mmhmm
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road oh my god I miss that you know it's always like
eat at night
mmhmm
oh yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left um indonesia
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money lah like me and my
mm
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like um during
because for them it's like
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here lah we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
yeah
mm
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
hmm
but like okay lah I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
mm
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
mmhmm
mmhmm
hmm
like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
oh
mmhmm
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said lah it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september eh september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
is I think is in England it's here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments lah for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
mmhmm
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel lah like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
mm
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
mm
mmhmm
yeah I mean like same I mean like I met
err rifky in the morning because like
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
rifky err I called rifky in the morning I said like hey do you want food
they were just doing their roundings ah but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
like
late at night lah
like it was so it's super nice it's like um
very innovative in my opinion
it's nice
mmhmm
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
but it's okay lah I mean like I still like the atmosphere there lah it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
oh I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
mmhmm
yeah that's what I feel also like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
um but yeah lah but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
ah you get it lah
you know ah there's this place I like to eat also it's called um indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
ah Indomie then after that they have like for example like
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as um
like um malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this ah I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
yeah actually same lah the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
uh applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
mm
they will say like oh we'll get back to you if we need you something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like I didn't get the job like
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah lah I mean like it's just
frustrating lah and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
mmhmm
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know lah hopefully we'll get a job soon lah hopefully
actually ah I also under like over underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got mm like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole ah
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
I like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
hmm
mm
mmhmm
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation lah like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
err they were err the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
um the right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
oh if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
oh maybe uh we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were like you know
hoping to not get the uh virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
I don't know ah cause I feel like
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it lah like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
um way like in like january like before he was
like before it like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
um the err the or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then ah before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't err they didn't let
the uh the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the mm
president can uh enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
um
most of the things are like you know like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
uh most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense kan apparently common sense isn't not
who
I don't know dinosaur
oh okay that is so stupid
what's his name
yeah lah I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also lah but then like yeah those like
yo and boring one like okay lah maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention lah like
okay err there was ah
this person said
uh what did the okay cause like
um what did err what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
uh the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
mm
hmm
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
oh okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
like for example if I uh if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
uh I mean err for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting lah but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
yeah lah like
dah
dah dah like COVID eh so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing eh
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but ah there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like eh not sushi sorry um
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay lah for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
mmhmm
hmm
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
um
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to like at night
and then like you know just
have fun lah you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at or something right
mm
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
oo who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
I mean it was fun uh I mean like err I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near right but then like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like uh
to communicate with like our other uh relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
but yeah cool lah then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my uh my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice lah like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
hmm
mmhmm
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
my family members you know I really miss it too
yeah no my aunt's um cousin
like from her other side then like we
err an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
I love it
ah
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
I don't know
yes oh my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some um the other time like I had an aunt
okay lah I mean like for mm for me for for you like you want to do anything like
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
there's such thing
like your focuses are wrong seh but
you know people want to like you know
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
mm
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I think about it eh it's like
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
mm
hmm
hmm
for me like
cause like I come my parents uh my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
to make it like stand out okay lah maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
hmm
I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like err got aircond then you know
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
oo ee
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
mm
it's okay man like I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
yeah I mean I have err I have names for like maybe my future children then like uh um
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna malika
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name maliki
and I don't know I like the name like
ayla like A Y L A you know because I feel like
ah it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting lah obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
mmhmm
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so ah it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
mm I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm oh I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean um
I mean I don't understand ah for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
and
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn a new language and stuff but then I thought about it lah like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better lah cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad lah cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
mmhmm
yeah oh my same lah cause like I my my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying ah like
oh my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
and then like my mum was saying lah like
um ah my mum was saying saying like ah like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
for sure cannot help them with their malay
mmhmm
mm
oh
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
even though like growing up like you know
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad

eh
um okay I was suppose to start my day at ten but it's already twelve
so that happen
so that every okay okay it's recess week you meant to take breaks right ya that's
ya that's true but at I have an assignment due tomorrow
yes yes
yes we take the same thing
ya
oh
cause I woke up at eight thirty then I just like took my time
and then like I eat at home
just told me that she is coming is coming late so I was like okay lah
she said that she was thinking of tumpanging with
his her parents cause the parents sending the brother to school
no just some eh primary school I think ya
then in the end she said she couldn't wake up I mean that thing happens to a lot of us sia
ya
no she stays in choa chu kang
ya
mm mm
busy uh ya so that they can now set a target put in your schedule as well
according to her they are not going to do a department photoshoot more of like individual photoshoot
cause like I don't know I think it was hard also for them to come out with department photoshoot
no idea what they are going to do I guess we shall
um see how is it going to be like
she is the ya she is the head
ya she is head she is head
acap
ya
ad hoc ad hoc me
I am so happy honestly
I'm I'm loving my life
next sem no they said that this sem I feel won't have volunteers
ya it's more of online stuff
haven't right
members ya
haven't open yet
oh
don't know whether that's slow or not but it's not my problem also
yes that is true
a'ah
all the best to them I remember during my time we did both at the same time
like finding the heats and opening up the recruitment
those were the days
good thing I'm not FOMOing I think if I miss it I will FOMO and will join so
no I don't think I want to join I don't think so
are you planning to join
ya
that's true ya you don't need to like try some more
ya
yes last year best year there's right so I'm doing other shapes yes instead of doing school stuff
yes
yes what is the other things that we should be doing
oh my god I always wanted to see
ha okay K K
ya
ya
oh okay lah and
oh
cause other dating apps you need to upload a legit photo of yourself right to make sure that
ah I've been wanting to see how it works
oh is that
oh
ha
you cannot like delete the profile ah
serious then what did the guy do
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think oh
oh
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me lah
Muzmatch
uh
mm
oh
cool through half of our deen
ya
ya
oh
oh
oh my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our deen instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our deen also for muslim
oh
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
oh
interesting
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray oh okay
ya
oh
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
oh
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
um people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that oh my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like oh okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
oh
ya
that is so sad
ya
hmm
that is sad
oh well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
ah that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor lah somethings like trekking oh my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like um sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
ha
tricky question don't know eh I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
oh ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
oh okay okay sure
few months okay
oh ya then the first one eh
oh my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
ah
kan like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
wah
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen lah
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
oh that is super rude though
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
mm
oh okay okay
ya
oh
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
oh okay
uh huh
ya
oh okay that's so fast but that's so cute too lah
interesting
oh
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
oh
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
ah
oh
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
I don't know lah you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
mm
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
oh I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine lah
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya oh my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
a'ah a'ah my friends also
at first I was like ah I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like ah but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems a'ah and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
obstacles challenges you will go stronger lah and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
kan
I mean like in other countries you will still be a minority too
multiculturalism whatever it is
I don't even know what that is
uh huh
ya but she's like oh okay
ya ya ya
you just one way
ya have you watched enola
neither have I I thought my sister and my parents watch it last night
girl this lady asking sherlock I think asking sherlock
do you saw it then I was like oh my god ya
ya ya ya
fits you perfectly
I was like bro damn that is like I don't need
mm okay ya
ya
ya that's true that's true
nah nah
then like mm okay
that's weird
it's so jarring to us maybe but
which suits them perfectly
it's so sad
does he saying that it does not exist oh my god
ya
that's quite sad
then we should step up more so that there will be more representation
otherwise they wouldn't hear right really meh
even if I step up will they hear
do they want to listen in the first place
where is the empathy right
people's action
hais
ya like other countries aren't any better either
right right that's the thing right
then like okay fine I am very grateful for that but like
why like why are you comparing our country with other countries who are even not even on par with us like we are
I don't think we should just compare countries across countries like that
ya ya that's the thing
ya
like even if they allow us to wear is like there is still this line
which is sad like sure like he just like I told you to wear what
then like you still treat me so differently just because I wear a hijab
ya like what you think I don't deserve those rights only some people deserve the rights
oh my god why is everything so funny
ya
kan that is the sad part like in retrospect I feel so
sad that why was I like that it was so gross and disgusting
hais
it's okay to be void of
ya sad life
sad life

so like are you working from home now or what
mm
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring lah
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like alah online jer pe
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya lah but now um it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
ah ya lah ya lah I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
mm liho
kan
eh but I've been doing this err one cardio tau
err this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then um
video
oh no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
ah ah
because for me like
be consistent ah
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ah ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
um
okay lah maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it lah
oh
we met in err
primary school ah
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
oh my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
oh my
eh but actually kan
but actually
our friendship is like random
kan because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other kan
close
yes then
wow you know I'm an introvert kan then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
oh my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay lah okay lah let's not go that direction
oh about my boyfriend eh
okay lah okay ah I think
mm
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay err what was the last time that I told you about him eh do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
err eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because kan he um because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
kan so like um
his condition kind of worsen tau
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him lah got worse
he
something wrong err there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole um
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
mm ya
ya because
like
mm okay
okay actually kan that time he asked me tau
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know eh because you know my soft spot for my ex kan
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to err my friend
that guy
ah like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
kan
actually kan to think of it I think he was like my only best friend tau
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit seh double blow ah in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
um like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay lah I was a shitty person
then
ah
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him tau
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
err it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
oh wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so lah I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
err what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said um
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again lah
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me um
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious seh I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day

oh
mmhmm
a'ah seh
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
oh okay
is
oh ya ya

my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these leh I don't think this err all the researchers I think it's okay lah to all these to talk about all these things ah I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
a'ah
mm
mm
mm
uh uh god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks err assuming one game a week lah
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per ah for the whole tournament kan then we take just ten percent that's uh between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour lah outside lah now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out lah but whatever it is at least eh the whole tournament um one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
uh I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
um I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
ah
ah
en
mm
ya
ah
mm
mm
a'ah
a'ah
ah ah
mm
mmhmm
ah exactly exactly ya
mm
ah
ah
mm
mm
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point lah is that social media aspect lah so
but um the social media aspect of a one off thing eh
err
ah ya
ya
ah
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and ah we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio eh how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not ah
mm mm
hmm hmm hmm maybe maybe who knows maybe
mm
mm mm
mm
I
ah okay all the tournaments then
you know so
ya so
mm
mmhmm
mm
err five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know err so err or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that ah we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool eh wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off tau this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
mm
mm
ya correct
uh huh
ya okay
uh huh
ya
mm
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say eh we do everything for every
let's say every saturday lah eh every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get err thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have um four four prize winners
each of the prize winners err okay and then at least err total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright um
or we could just put it every every week err the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number lah K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay a'ah and then like this ah we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool lah basically lah alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say eh thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that lah so let me get up my word pad my notepad ah so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
oh six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually ah we can't do that maybe top eight ah top eight get five percent lah
yes
ah
ya get a wise five uh eh
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
uh huh
a'ah
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent ah
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great lah okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
um
ya
eh of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is lah whatever amount
there will really get people to like eh siala if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at eh I only pay five dollar registration fee tau I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
a'ah correct
so that's it we need to have at least
um
um
okay but that's why okay you um then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
mm mm
mm true also true also difficult ah
mm
sixty four possible
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
en
mm
so this idea eh is basically if I were to go to N
en
err but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them kan they're all out for it
his words lah
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
let me
ah
let me try and see if I can find err
err what's that called lah
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
err basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations ah
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then err this err will have err the our
what I'm afraid of eh is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about lah like
err like um even when I I told her the idea look ah why not err we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these tau she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event tau
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african lah
that's the number one thing ah
yes
ah
ah
mm
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor lah
a
ah
ah
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible um you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all lah you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
err potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
um
ya ya correct
a
uh huh
a
you will have your own you know shout out lah you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising ah a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events eh is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they err how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer lah in a way lah
it's the same as advertisement ah so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
mm but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head eh I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay err so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us lah okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
mm
yup mm mm mm
so
ha ha
a'ah sia
alamak
alamak
okay
okay
ya
okay
um
there's another
ah correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports lah
one play E sports
pure err pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
mm
ya the singapore premier league a week ago err three point eight K views
mm
err what's that called
okay E singa cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
err E singa cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs ah
for the one V one E singa cup
one V one E singa cup
oh they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands ah early thousands
you know so ya
oh shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
ah
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel err you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because eh if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just err aiman giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then err what's that called ah ya and then like this ah people will be alerted
ya
exactly
ah correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because ah I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
ah
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
um
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want eh it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can uh we can get lah we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
ah ya so
mm
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who sekaiichi is ah they just look at pure viewership numbers ah we can talk about them eh we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
ah
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because um and you know really likes to work together with me lah basically lah
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA lah so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm ah
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
um so abu um
so how ah I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend

I won't be able to sleep I need to eat
ah
really
the long
historical korean dramas whatever this one long
yes
only if I if my eyes loop
I only realise it when I saw when I met haziq yesterday I don't know if he saw my Tik Tok or not but I was like no one saw his face and ah now I know now I know what is dark humour

later on later on I think so after that fight with the eight tails then they will be like a
um all the five nations no all the five nations will meet together
to discuss on the upcoming war
and then after that a subsikey will just appear and then say I will I will declare war on everybody here
ya all because
his battle naruto

cannot oh my god I just realised I spent
oh the the filler episode I will always skip one
the you always can check um
is it easy
page right just search for naruto then search for the synopsis part and then you see you scroll down the moment you see the words filler right
then you just skip ah you will know which
the owner like get surgery on this its actually because
one of the ways to make it look nicer is I have to go for the surgery lah ya basically like cut a piece of the skin off and then stitch it together and make it like but someone do that but just double surgery on both
make it look like right
serious ah

if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
mmhmm
uh huh
oh
with roti or nasi like
if I want to eat rendang I rather choose
then
it's like fantastic lah

mmhmm
okay lah okay lah I kind I kind of understand lah
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
I think I think right I think
and then
we don't need to worry about
you know
so if you don't have to work
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think for me
um I only risk
failures lor
oh I risk time
side is time because I feel like
because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically lah
so macam like
like ugh
it's so sad right
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
not everybody is that lucky I guess
mmhmm hard work is also another thing
mmhmm
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like eh you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
mmhmm
true lah
at the same time also you feel like like
err there's also there's always new things to discover I guess
explore and try
mm
mmhmm
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for

we may be looked as equals
yeah basically
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like oh ah
like he's the only child so
you know
hmm
mmhmm
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically ah
like their requirement to like oh for women to be considered
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
uh huh
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
mmhmm
mm
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
uh huh
mmhmm
uh huh
but I think for me leh uh
so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose lah
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story lah
is a is a lesson to learn
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
ah
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices lah for me to to
uh one

whatever I can get whatever I can eat and not worry about the what not worry about the
percussion
repercussion
isn't percussion like a a music instrument
oops
ya repercussions later yes like diabetes or something like that I mean like I won't eat so sweet lah
what do you think about bubble tea
can you do you think you can live without bubble tea
a need
ya to me also like I can like live without bubble tea
ah actually also it's been like
two weeks since I had my KOI ovaltine macchiato
bubble tea
oh damn that was long
yeah I wanna eat
now I feel like drinking
yah
you weirdo
you need at least one bubble tea a month
that's fine
yeah especially the gym junkie cause you got protein
I like the protein
uh huh
uh huh
ya lah cause of the protein
I think this is where my extra mass also come from
but you know sometimes I like to just buy the kid size
because like I feel like the original is too much
want to buy boost tapi I don't want so big because I want to go for the interview but I want something small enough to like
drink it so I bought the kids one
and it was so nice it was so cute I like cute stuff
okay baby I think I want to sleep
yay
okay bye lah
bye

woohoo
let's go hello
mmhmm
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
mmhmm
oo
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya um I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
a bit of both
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
how do I do
oo
ya
that's a good superpower
oo
saves time
ya
wow
I've never thought of that
unusual
oo
then I think
uh first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
ten years ago oo
right
wow
wow ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
mmhmm
ya
I think that is peer pressure
kan
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
oo
oh you call it monitor in your school
class chair
mmhmm
mmhmm
they have different ya
mmhmm
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I oh ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it um have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two uh different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic um just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student um leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had um the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
and we are good with uh literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
mmhmm
of course
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like a stable right
ya
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat um sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
ya
mm
in school
oo
yes
something else
wow
the best
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
chicken wrap
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
ya
kan
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
oo ya
ya
fragrant
oo
ya
the ramen the japanese ramen that's my number one
ah that's good ramen there's the
end stall that's why
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also kimchi ramen
the beef
ramen
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
I mean
as long as halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
oo
we're sticking to that oh my god ya
ya
sensitive
ya
perspectives
mmhmm
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
um bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
oo don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
ah
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
um which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
uh and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same what like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies uh I remember one time
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like um she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
um
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like huh what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
council you're the thing you're popular but
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
ya
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
wow
orh
wow
one wish
I would say
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
I will go through it you know
ya
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
mm
mmhmm
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I've been talking
oh
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
oo
ya
mmhmm
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right oo
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but oo
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay ah I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
uh plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
um you don't have any commitment to something
mm
mm
wow
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
cause bali eh bali balling okay
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm jumeirah
ya
ya
yes
that's why I want to go there
like scared
level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
oo
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
the floor kan it's not like the straight
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me
yes
screw secondary school
screw bullies
a'ah
ya
mmhmm
ya
okay
ya let's go
for free
it's free
but what
ya that's all I think I will go
imagine being a traveller
like working as a traveller
how risky not how cool how risky
it's up to the producer tau
that's risky
okay
mmhmm
in specific
mmhmm
generally
drama
it's you I
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
I like romance
oh you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
ya
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty kan
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
mm
that's the thing I don't like to watch
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
mm
but something that really shook you up
oh ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
money
ya
mmhmm
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
you know what I mean
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
apocalypse
how
ah
ya
infected
um
wow
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but um how would we end humankind
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
but like how long could that last
and how long could this um virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly wow
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
oh ya ya
oo fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
mmhmm
ya
and find ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's not mandatory
ya although even uh during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
um whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of um like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
is
hmm
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where um
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
mmhmm
for the rest of my life
wow
um
okay
shoot
meat
steak wow
everything
ya
boil
oo oh ya
ya
I think
a'ah eh
okay
karma
ya
what goes around comes around
we always tend to think the best of yourself
oh
oh karma
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think ya
yours
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
oh you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oo
oh we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
of course
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
what's the point
what's the point ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting jer
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
wow
ya
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
yes
really hard but ya
like it's just cause I'm small
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like um the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious lah
mm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
wow
wow
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
ya of course
mm
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
mmhmm
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
mmhmm
ya
like a space is what you need
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence

ya
irfan was like an outlier lah he's
his situation is I've never heard of
he like
ya
can safirah fall in love with like some normal guy
kan
a'ah
ya
ya
we would put it in like one basket
great grandmother
sec two or sec three
she was she was the seekers she used to take care of my theatres all the time when she was
if like a good education

eh amshar I'm doing good lah how how about you
you mean great and just
what's up ah with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life ah
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do lah like like for example
weekend is the only time I got time lah to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of err measures that have been imposed ah that we need to
you eh what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
one hundred is it
hundred people ah now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
oh so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures lah
then I got wedding I need to go to lah next week then is
err from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
people per like per time ah
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
then there's no like what intermingling lah between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts lah
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this ah is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially lah it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful lah
ya
oh no serious serious like my uncle's
err wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay ah
eh then that time your I remember you posted something about err
ya that one I'm not
ya
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like err a bit of a
contention here right because uh
some people say that err
or poly or something ya ya
something like that lah from that's what I understand lah but I haven't really read into it yet lah so
okay
oh
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
err will also affect judging from err taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well lah
ya
speak
ah
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us lah especially
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good lah ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly ah do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not ah
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social lah
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas lah
can or not
ya
like your own circle lah ya I I agree with you about that lah I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
people outside my own social circle and
err I got to make new friends ah which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
err these two years err
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya lah I mean we all have our different opinions about lah but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it lah while it lasts ya
mmhmm
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go lah because I feel
like err
I can err
well when I'm outside lah as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
eh I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents lah now is like the best time for me to after right
um you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else lah ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay ah now looking back err
it's not such a bad deal lah
mm
really meh you think it will really
help us meh like cake
oh okay fair enough
yes
mm
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I uh I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go err amshar what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say uh you're going out with your family
I think those kind of places really got the vibes ah ya
you really just feel like uh you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones lah
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience lah then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
err free kan everyone got uh no plans so we all just go err at least have a meal lah together
and most of the time err my mum will cook and then err
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat ah
you worst comes to worst is err
how you call that we just order in food lah if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays kan
so
even though err we then we will go out like
ya so
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore lah you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones lah
ya
I think for me I like to
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me lah
ya because friends are what uh
has made me like uh what I am today for the
how could I say ah for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends lah
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely err
uh enjoy spending time with them lah ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
so the
so it's all about err that
what you call that
balance lah between err spending time with
err your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on amshar
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father lah right they talk about
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation lah having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together lah like they say it's err every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that uh helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad lah ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january mah
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours lah
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
what
ya cause err I don't know people had extra then they just give me ah
so the five of us just went in together then
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday lah ya
and one of the worst workout days
ah first thing I went back to bunk ah I just
like wah what am I doing
far away from my family in in awhile lah doing something that
I didn't uh explicitly choose to do lah
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause uh we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole err walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that lah but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends lah and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good lah then we'd be even closer ya
ah the most recent batch they did twenty four
err oh changi food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that um
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all lah ah you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself lah
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training ah
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone lah bro
oh ya ya that's true
mm
okay
okay
mm
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
I spend my money on lah so you know the money that I get I just
it's already like this much
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier what I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late ah ya so
what
oh the the amount of money I spend on
transport err food
and then after that err miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
err
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets err what you call that you don't really think about it lah
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want lah
so that's when you really need to be more
mm
mm
honestly correct correct um ah
mmhmm
ya lah
slightly more lah ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
you're really getting um
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes ah I understand
like what you said lah like when I first got it also I was like wah I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
err I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize err actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them lah
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now lah
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money lah
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand lah maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
err a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to err trying spending their money lah feeling that
I mean trying to err not to say like enjoy now lah
but err saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future lah ya so that we can always err
like help our family out lah or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others lah
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable lah
ya
mmhmm
four lah four
ya okay
mm ya
ya lah ah ya I understand where you come from lah
ah ya
mm
I think for for our generation it is like
ah no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors lah
since they're all what you call that ah
cause you know that that err we have that break routine um
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money lah for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
err fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
err throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job lah
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have err financial independence ah
and um do what you want with it lah
mmhmm
uh huh yes
ya
ya
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about um investing but
uh what uh I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship lah that's something I would like to work towards to lah
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say ah they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands ah
ya and really just err be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out whoa
maybe I might even consider signing on lah
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's uh realistic it's realistic it's worth especially um
err you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
ya it's acceptable lah ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain what
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education ah or in my case I guess uni lah so
by doing that really
um provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we ah
I think was about being like um financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
err responsible in that particular aspect of their live lah
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it lah because everyone is um
how to say it's not about
mm not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to err
take your ah carry your own weight ya and really err feel the sense of um
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from lah over these past few years lah
ya definitely lah
can we talk about food now amshar please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
ya eh so amshar ah what's your favourite food
huh
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
oh oh scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no ah like it's something that helps me
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being um
ya for the taste of it lah and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any err preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food lah
comfort food
hajjah maimunah bro hajjah maimunah expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
then I remember bought um
eight dollars for one head
wah that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it lah ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
a'ah
okay lah okay so we're talking wait ah so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards ban mian
ban mian
soup is like really something that wah I feel like ah tom yum also but tom yum is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat tom yum right the maggi one it just hits different lah I think
would definitely be instant noodles
then it's also quite easy to make lah then like that I also don't have to what
err wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
err for sustenance per se but it's all about um
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also lah
ya
okay lah
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth ah
oh swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
oh ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
wah I think now is like really the best lah
wah is that wah then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said lah I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
oh bulking season bro
ya
ya
oh ya
I think eh two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels lah and food was something that gave me comfort lah
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
so right
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling lah ah ya lah so
that that that the break time right was really very precious lah
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance ah but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying err the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring lah
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
mmhmm
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
mm
mm
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
um what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also lah
ya so it's like
ah they had they had the only they for the roti prata which is like not even allowed
oh so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking eh bro what's this ah what's this then after that
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this err
it was like wah really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories ah
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing lah because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
ya I mean if you're awake lah
that's a
prerequisite
uh
eh but speaking of food right do you cook
ya lah
ah yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like uh you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
ya wah that was a absolute err logistic nightmare
this one can make forty then come out wah twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
um wet
then I have to oh err ask my mum eh what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay alamak just add more flour lah that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
err usable lah ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like eh actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
err know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya lah ya lah
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control what
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like eh why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away lah
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun lah I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then err slowly drop off one by one
and you know uh
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
that trip was just for you bro
that's quite nice also lah ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
cause it was the COVID thing
no no uh
ya
and you had your interview
ya lah
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
err err ya
is not bad not bad
ha wah the things I do huh for my friends
uh
no lah
ya
mmhmm
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it lah
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
so I might as well just give it away lah then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still err like a blur for me because
the thing is um how to say this ah that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
but then err she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help lah
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time ah you can't help but
notice that eh you're kind of holding up the queue lah so
I should probably make you go a bit faster lah
but then I um feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how ah
ya
yes eh definitely
mmhmm
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
mm
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help lah
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it lah but at the same time that's when you guys come in lah when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience um
you know that um
you have to be sensitive lah be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone lah especially elderly person
ya oh my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat eh helping your friends oh talk about friends right then you
ah then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
oh my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
sedap then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
mmhmm
hmm
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like err more to being uh okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like eh you're
how how do I say this mm like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing lah huh
cause like let's just say eh err
let's go eat ah din tai fung you know obviously that's a no go for me
um make us feel bad so they will just err go to somewhere we can eat lah
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's err slightly limited lah
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
um let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
um
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go uh there's a lot of cheap ramen stalls
ya lah let's just say ramen stalls but they're not halal
cheaper ramen stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then wah the obviously the receipt be quite expensive lah
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
I don't want to make them feel paiseh also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind lah but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also lah but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk lah because at the end of the day like eh actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that uh but I've no no what's that err
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one ah
ya eh that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know ah there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
take to the edit ah there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places lah
ah like okay I meant bugis paya lebar or bugis bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat prata every single day bro
prata is not I can't live on prata bro ya
mm uh mm
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
they've err they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and uh they're slightly cringey
err what you call that national err health promotion board ah
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay jamaahs right
err coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like oh actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it lah and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same lah
like cause it's still the same dish mah
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya huh so
hmm
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of err will always comprise of
that lah of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but uh you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's err older right it's definitely something very difficult to
err change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages lah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ah bro then when the teh O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
eh ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
ya ah that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food lah
so the
but we only go there every week lah
that's when we are all are free mah cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend lah or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
err this kind because like I mean uh for
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool lah that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
mmhmm
ya lah
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya lah
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family lah because
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to lah quite close lah
she prepare less lah
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to err weekends is definitely bubble tea ah
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate eh
ah
oh so oh you're more of that old school bubble tea lah so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
and then got err sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
huh
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you wah you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars lah at least
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends lah something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely ah my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract lah you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya lah ya lah definitely lah I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else lah
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference ah
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

eh long time no see bro how are you bro
oh you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
wow six months eh
so uh what's your favourite country
serious ah
saudi arabia
mm
and then they have a lot of uh weapons uh
a lot of things ah so I don't really trust
spain
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get kan cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors ah
wow so they really suffer eh so all industry are affected by this eh
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
but then I decided that you know uh I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since ah
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still uh no choice ah what to do kan
ya so these things are are the same ah so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't ah allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant ah I can tell you it's actually pretty safe ah cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
mm
people who try to work as grab food deliveries eh
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity eh
I think ah then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity ah I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well lah I would say
mm
bro that one I think really depends on on the family that you're living with ah if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
then both of you are working then should be okay ah
you know
ah have a lot of kids for our parents you know
mm
mm
ya that's true though
um actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry ah if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think err the new families are more worried to even have children
they will definitely get it back
despite the circumstance that we are in
bro mine I think around six hundred plus ah cause I have a siblings in the house kan
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult lah for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way ah I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine ah but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle ah if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise ah
exactly
I think ah a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but err you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members ah so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then err you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health ah so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves lah cause they cannot take it already what
and then so this why all these things ah need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do ah
these things this ah period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up ah
we
suffer bro
mm
mm true ah true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health ah legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced ah ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do ah with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being ah no choice bro this is the hard time ah then
I really hope that this thing will go away ah seriously
ya of course bro
mm
mm true true I agree ah
but ah I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
um with this situation going on
err people who's been living
so I think is very difficult for those who are
ah who are well-off ah as compared to those who who who has been living err
but this is their difficult times
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims kan what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
oh
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states eh the ah ya uh the whole
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
I'm not I'm not
ya it it's so sad and so sick ah to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing ah I think it's it's too much ah to be honest
but like like like what I've said ah I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business ah sector that's why uh most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them ah
it's ironic ah we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change ah to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know err what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
mm
oh that that's
that's another actually interesting uh news ah
the this black people they black people kan you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those ah big uh big leaders last time err like muhammad ali the famous boxer and then
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know ah I don't understand what
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour kan why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased lah but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself ah but
it's just unfair ah cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid ah
mm
perform ah
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted lah in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of ah in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter tau so it's really sad ah
ya
err
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter ah
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges ah eh in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different ah
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays ah
but um
ya when you look at these malaysians eh they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays kan they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
or
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but uh
but then ya lah you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed ah in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things ah which doesn't really ah help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
ya mm
eh I I actually agree seh cause ah when I when I watch ah the parliaments in malaysia eh
actually quite jialat eh like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's err a person in-charge kan to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control ah to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
ya speaking of which err I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic uh
basic err
ah basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries kan cause you are representing you're representing your country what
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh ah which to me I find it very very ah interesting cause how can someone
err who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think uh it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia eh you can get away with all these things
um
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
mm
ah that's true eh I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes lah eh but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know eh I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense ah but speaking of I mean in regards to your question ah kan
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything kan so
it's not that err
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice ah and then probably err you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays ah
so ah I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes ah I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia ah cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money ah
mm
um how you upgrade yourself lah as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things ah doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education ah or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
err ya it's tough ah but I think overall still again it's all about balance ah if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily ah which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
serious ah
I I think it's uh I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
mm ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really ah
I mean I I I understand that some people some um
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent ah the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner ah
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work ah you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow ah
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have uh have with your child ah
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there lah I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad lah but we have no choice lah we are living in a country where
money is our priority ah over love ah
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time ah you have to make sacrifices ah
we have to make do with what we can ah no choice
so really ah it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide ah
uh both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
it's all priorities ah eh
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye

hello shita how are you

at all
not go work but um ah
I don't know leh I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
oh like a depression ah
wah man I don't know man
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything lah whatever people need lah
ah you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek

but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine ah cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
ah that's true lah
ya
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know sial
how is it going to be
of course not lah it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever lah got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think err global warming
would ya either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren lah
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know leh
oh because of the pandemic now

how about you
theme park that one got the universal studios singapore
mm
women who who who
oh
ya actually that one sia the
uh what work uh work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard lah because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
then you can
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like what or they use Zoom ah
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward ah because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say eh teacher how to do this one
you know
oh god but then now that at home right
during class all I keep watching Tik Tok ah then
ya got the that one the
when dissolved then thomas super previously
oh my god you know but then kan
like been able to like cycle even more
then that time I go cycle for like
almost six hours eh brother I go to bukit timah Zoom Zoom

there's two ways that's the way tick
the
oh my god just now I saw this one Tik Tok
what about you what kind of super power would you want
oh my god but actually I would I would want to be invisible also
ya I can go inside the toilet
no no like when you go inside toilet then when you pooping like that no one can see your legs so you don't scared
like it's a it's a very stupid question to ask
ya I think so I don't know I never see who it is
I just hear the voice
um
annoying but then actually right flying would also be good superpower nowadays
because breakdown then got jam
you can just fly to your destination
no but the thing is you got
your superpower is flying not super strength you cannot carry anyone
oh
you know
true true
you can fly but you cannot carry anyone with you
ya people see superman fly also but they don't care what
you know like there was spiderman one then toby maguire
then he was sending the pizza
then he wanted to send the pizza in like five minute or not he get fired
then after that like he he go behind the ally the change to the spiderman outfit
then after that he like fly out from the ally lah then after that like with the pizza in his hand but he very used to prepare costume
then after that people be like
the spiderman stole the guy pizza
like they they they never they never think that the
he's not the that person is spiderman
I think he just need a secret identity that's why just like that costume
yes
cannot I don't think you don't need a costume can just wear
a like fit that is like fitting to the flyer just wear like a
then people will like
ya
ya
ya
nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
oh my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much ah six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three
ya but then like when I play when I buy only after that I never play you know
I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times
like fifteen minutes fifteen
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad lah but then
damn you should play it
oh my god you just now just saw you say miss bae right like miss bae from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school sia I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the one I was I was the one I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first one
okay ah I might be the worst ah but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no lah he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister irman
that teacher
then after that like uh I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his uh attitude ah he's like he would prefer to like uh uh give his attention to those who are better you know
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like uh
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
um
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
uh what ah it became like
I just did a photoshop lah of people like climbing onto the that was very old
oh
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene lah so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya eh I remember you were doing also ah but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
oh my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
uh
trail
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic kan
ya
tired
even in english also I can say like tired lah
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me ah in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
it's
ya
but
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army ah even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because sui sui in engineering
mm got chemical engineering
you know
ah
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you oh we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like what five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst one is the people who who already have high pay lah because their
their lifestyle is already like uh I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard lah
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
eh why gym close ah cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
oh my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
uh
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase ah then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good ah because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay ah obviously there's some limitations ah
but
ya he went to the extent
no ah because his house was too small like he he he showed uh showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
ya
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
savage love ya I don't know but then like
it's quite cool ah because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun ah
oh my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren tan that one or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like eh you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside ah like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable sia but I like the concept
it's like
yes
ya
mm but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
oh my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during eh during primary school
um
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like uh they showed uh around lah like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube kan
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
ya
a'ah
ya
more thick
to make it more thick
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything ah
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant ah I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like uh
actually I saw this one whole circuit
oh like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect ah
ya question ah
oh my god
bicycle
excursion ah
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
oh my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away sia
ya we'll be fourty then like also like eh oh my god eh ti you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand oh the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the
uh if you never bring your own bag you pay ten cent for each plastic bag that they use
ya
ya sia you know like especially all those aunties right
you know like you tell them eh plastic bags cost fifty cent now ah they they'll be like oh my god oh my god then they will like buy their own bags one confirm
because right especially these aunties right I see some of the aunties ten cent already they don't want to spend extra
then
ya sia they they will like be more inclined to like confirmed buy one
um
oh my god then that time right I was so proud ah
ya
change the world make the world more better
I never listen ah michael jackson
ya
I don't know your auntie but then your auntie like like what kind of things
oh
ya
ya
they always flex their Adidas Fila what what other shop Nike also
hypebeast hypebeast all
ya
ya but then anyways ah so what what you planning to get for your auntie since anyways like everyone like buying their own thing right so you cannot buy anything expensive for her what you gonna get
mm
ya
ya you guys should have like coordinated earlier
later you all later she get like ten handbags from like ten cheap brands later she don't like
but what do you think she would like
what what do you think she would like
mm

it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say ah
how's your day
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday kan she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
oh miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already what what's happening
yesterday right
then cheng san was like oh I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and ming gee that's six people okay
and she's like oh some of them say they are open to it
um and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say oh they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group lah if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it oh so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her lah and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else ah like
you got your own issues then
ugh okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time ah
then now she go
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny ah
oh she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
eh
do not off
mm
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim boon lay kan
man it's just generally quiet lah also
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was syaza's syaza's shoot
but syaza's shoot jingle was there
serangoon but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
ow
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion wow
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
ah I don't know lah it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one uh huh
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say ah
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday lah in school so ya
ah ya
once every twice a month
okay lah
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
eh but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
and I'm like
mm I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
but it was quite cool lah
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel del luna
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
mm
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool lah
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like huh
maybe I should do that duh I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like ho
ya
but
it was an option ah
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
mmhmm
oh okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first eh one for one eh
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent kan to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
huh
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation kan a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like oh you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty ah
I have nothing to say about that ah
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility kan
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not kan
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
migrant workers and community cases like as if
like it's the same thing both is humans
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
obviously with everybody what with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
aiya it's so
shady
but we know that lah
but
but just what like
mm but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like wah I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad lah like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
mm just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere aiya it's just
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
oh okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like oh I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
I don't know lah
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
mm
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
yay we love grey areas
aiya and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
you know
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
because this is
islamic law kan but it's not like
until the scholars were like hmm
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like hmm we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
then it's like hmm you know
culture changes also so it's like ugh
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change ah but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
and not
whether
thoughts of this so deep
moved a circle
really ah shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
eh I spend a lot of my day talking err like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes err sometimes I never notice then oh marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
oh all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you what all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them lah and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
mm
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
wah I don't know man
are you saying me and jufri have the same face
attractiveness level
eww
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like err so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app kan I I
at first I put my name
kan like my whole name I'm nabilah
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private lah and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like whoa people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
ee that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
ugh
oo I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already lah to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable lah because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
ee and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly lah actually he's worse than jufri
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
like
are you okay
you know and then
uh but his
he's weird lah
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny lah ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child lah
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
but it was like damn disgusting
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like eww like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
eww no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the ah the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
oh my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
it is funny ah
mm
I think he
he's crazy ah
oh my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
mm
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like oh
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
oh my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I ah ya
it's like I get it lah okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like oh I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like oh
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
mm
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know ugh
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
mm uh you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
aiya and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
that is just not my style
aiya my worst match just for ego boost lah lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life mm
it's quite funny ah
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell lah then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
err
I don't know I think I will still talk to you oh you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
ah that's quite funny
I mean
mm
actually I'm the same lah
but I short lady ah so good for me
mm
I'd feel iffy about it lah but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm eh I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like huh
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket lah bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so aduh it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
aiya
I lazy ah
ya
higher angle eh
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
oh
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad ugh
ya
I have so many selfies
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid lah
okay lah at least I rent a smart eight one lah
but he's damn tall sial
he's damn tall to me lah
you talk about him I'm like oh
ah
ya
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay lah he sees you like that what and he still like you so
that's all right right hmm
you you you know it's it's legit
I don't know I never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing I know I think it's about me

you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish

on that day

um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct

then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course

oh this is so interesting
ya
wah these boys boys babe eh sorry sorry not my apologies hwa chong institution

ya
sundilah

sundilah
privilege ah
wait and the constituency that he's at voted for him he's my constituency
ya
ah people's voice
but he was not the
yes correct correct ya and err like the the guy I think the secretary
this is who I'm voting
oh wow congratulations it's like
ya
wow sham
wow I'm so proud of you
wow
alright okay

I'm fine thank you
how's your family
ah
ya second one is a boy right
oh I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
oh
uh I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it um you might know them because some of them are our former ah schoolmates
oh you're into baking now wah that's nice wah must try some of your cake soon ah
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
ah movie but ah during this pandemic kind of hard lah because I think with the crowd control and all
wah netflix and chill ah
err I don't know uh only so far only a few have confirmed but uh
I will update you ah on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can lah uh
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
ah
um but is it too young for them to start
um going to tuition at this age she's only six years old kan
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that err everyone is competing uh so
it's
it has its pros and cons ah like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly lah but surely uh I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important lah they just try their best lah
and
I I do have other maybe uh I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
oh oh
orh okay okay I understand I can ask for you lah then
err we'll see what we can arrange
err
wah you sit down at coffeeshop ah I thought you atas one
oh you you full time housewife ah
good lah
actually it's better for to me lah personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
um like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore err I think err
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive ah then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day uh some owners also like abuse their maid lah so that's not right lah I feel
ya there's uh the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse ah think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news lah but you just have to be updated lah now with the
COVID nineteen ah I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that lah before they are cleared to do cleaning oh mm
oh must take care of your health now lah
like but I think if now if you go to any
uh I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya lah for those who are working lah they will give you like
to check on yourself
err so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ah
uh alhamdulilah so far
I'm okay lah maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest uh because of work ah
um politic lah then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what uh
safety measure measurement at work mm cause yes
now currently we have this installation uh of doraemon at the national museum it's interesting lah but
unless I'm there lah then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ah
uh
uh claim it
oh usually you go to johor ah and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well lah to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
mm
oh
ah so it's like
uh they have different sizes lah and
uh they cater also for kids
mm
mm
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing ah for phase three to roll out but ya lah depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert lah it's important lah for us to be on alert
ah foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
mm
ya lah
mm
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think uh for those who are coming in I think
uh they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure ah I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required lah eh even when they come in they have to do the swab test lah
ah
ya thankfully
a
mm yes yes
uh I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the uh the conduct the test
was mm asked to leave I think he got a job as a security lah err and considered is also a high risk because err he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm uh
but actually they're paying quite
high lah is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that lah because they don't want to
be in contact ah ya don't want to be exposed to this uh and even when he he's finished his job think he ask uh his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can uh remove his clothes outside his house uh ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace lah so it's just an
additional steps ah precaution ya
ah
ya you see
ah so it's not easy ah it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
a few cartons eh I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe lah
got some quality is not that good ah
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask ah
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no lah I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last lah err for a few months then but you have to
wash lah I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse lah
mm
err according to the
safety measurement I think
mm
ya can okay lah that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
mm
ah three kan mm
mmhmm
mm
feels also quite sad lah for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something ah but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad lah but it's better than not having no job and all lah ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya lah
ya lah it's tiring lah even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now uh doing grab but grab is also affected err think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he uh took back the car ya but still it's not doing well lah he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental uh
to the family lah
mm true lah I think
the government implementing a lot of err help for those
need them ah they also I think they have set up this um united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need lah ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march ah I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya lah things will get better lah think I think for singaporean ah they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases ah that can affect us
prata
uh there's a prata at sin ming I think it's quite nice it's run by a family uh father and a son
can can um
can ah maybe I want to try eat the briyani ah
the briyani is quite nice ah I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best ah
err what do you want to order I help you order
the briyani or the prata coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste ah
can
uh I think I eat briyani with uh fried chicken lah mm because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking ah
then what drinks do you want
teh peng teh peng
teh with ice eh
ya but I think is not that good to always drink teh with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better lah at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health err and also see what eat we eat
ah and also see what we eat
okay
can
uh
anything else
wah there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
uh you order lah since you are very good using app
um briyani chicken
ya fried chicken
mm
ah yes
oh so we have to pick up or
oh okay oh that's
ya I understand but err I volunteered with err an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food err to buy groceries so that they will minimize err their movement outside ah so they can actually err contact us and have like medication
uh you can buy for them and then send it to their homes um
ya lah I think it's a long way to help our seniors uh
because I think if they are exposed to this I think um probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is uh I think done by government agencies ah they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors uh so that they will not be exposed much ah so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies ah then we will be there to send groceries medication uh food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer lah through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask eh for more information lah ya
um
free ah
mm
ya
communication
is
mm
mm
ya lah
data
mm
oh the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort ah to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal ah
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide lah
ah
the social distancing ah
mm
mm
ah social distancing ambassador
mm
ah

so the first day um afro was like in the corner
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something

oh but then again cause I'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay
okay
ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is shonan
ya
okay
okay
ah
explode
a'ah ah
okay strength
okay
oh okay wow
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
mm
huh then how does he talk
ha so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
oh my god
okay okay okay
you watch two episodes
three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right oh you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
huh serious ah
how many episode is it
oh you mean like each season got twenty something episodes chey
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite gundam series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
mm
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy lah like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
hmm
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start lah it did spur it it started my my thing for gundam so okay fine fine I give you that bandai
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay lah fun
hmm
ya
yes so how did it go
hmm
she's like tall she's so tall
hmm
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
oops
huh
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore oh okay she knows eh
wow
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
mm
mm
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
oh ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
mm
ya ya ya
okay
oh ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments lah
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy ah
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked uh najhah about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many eh
maybe at most twenty plus lah but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as naruto and all that with like five hundred and two seasons eh three seasons eh in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya lor like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
ah

so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly lah it supposed to be a little like teng teng teng I mean
oh yikes
it scarred you
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
um
oh
okay okay
ah
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like

okay okay okay oi
ah light festival
a'ah
ya it's obvious
good times ya
ya lah
mm
mm
ya
ya mm ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
anna nah a'ah
ya same
ah
a'ah

hello
okay can alright mm
so how are you
ya lah you what have you been doing
mm
mmhmm
so
so
really
oh I don't like to work from home especially
about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different lah
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how how how is that
effective ya
mm it's not at all also
oh my god and the
and he he is used to that
mm
and your room
oh okay
or
orh
mm okay so the experience is quite
okay lah for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
back to school already right
oh
oh one more month wow
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
wow you got
two months of holiday ah not bad ah you
mm
uh huh
like what
why
spent too much on what
oh how much you earn ah that that that job
mm
hundred per
oh
ninety nine
per night
wow
okay
makeup stuff
orh
Tampines
huh then how you travel seh
Yishun correct orh so you got straight bus there lah
technically lah a bit lah
compared to staying at ah compared to where you are now until
mm okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience what you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
uh
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K lah
mm
wow not bad ah you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
uh the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up what
ah kan so if you are the first person it's the easiest job ah but quality check a bit hard ah
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
err we start at about nine kan then we need to
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the ah the rice is either you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target lah but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person ah so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at Woodlands there lah
mm so they needed manpower uh so they asked manpower from my company so so ya lor
mm
yup my current company lah so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them lah mm
mm
ya lor so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand lah what it means when you say fast paced
oh
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can lah
no ah you will learn one usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good lah
three K lah three K for I don't know how many weeks of working lah so ya
oh
oh
so you what you
oh okay okay can
mmhmm
mm
okay
oh
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup one
you just sign up only
mm then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
oh
oh but night shift though
mm
technically ah what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight
so eight to eight err eight to eight ah
oh
okay lor can lah then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
mm I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
mm ee I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
oh okay okay okay okay
oh
that's why you guys spend time together
mm
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
oh I mean
oh
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good lah good lah
mm
not talk
mm
well good lah good lah at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already ah
what
three years
not bad ah three years ah this is this the longest
mm
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay lah actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya lah because his side he don't make it he don't
uh his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya mm
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like hais eh cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
err me and him are dealing shitty stuff now lah so ya
do you know what he's working now
mm you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram ah
oh
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but uh under there's a sister company called
so err basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
mm so okay lah
ah so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people kan
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages uh different character
okay lah I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so um
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay ah now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me ah oh um
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like uh means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means ah means ah like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about Lina that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
ah so that is the first time it happened
ah it
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested lah because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is err volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
ah
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional uh breakdown ah I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp lah like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating lah but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct a'ah
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kan uh
ya
this is what I'm trying to say lah don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is um
err way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say ah this is me ah this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit lah
so ya hais
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up uh like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me ah if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya lah
like that's why when you things like uh on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
ah I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know lah
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly lah
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
mm
mm
but you you do try to recover after that right
mmhmm
mm ah that's the word make up
mm
ya lah
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
kan
mm
mm
mm mm
with him
mm at least at least a goal with him kan
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like err am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
uh like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
met his parents
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
haiya ya lah the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
mm eh
like
kan kan so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
mm
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where uh like
mm
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story lah okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware sia
err like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
hais
hais
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only lah I hint to my mother only lah
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to uh
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya loh
on my Instagram I think people can like oh okay Hans and Lina is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
mm
too
I have fallen for him too hard that uh now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person lah but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
ah it's just me expressing my emotions
mm and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
huh
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout ah so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing lah
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so um
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already lah so that is good enough
hmm ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand lah
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy seh
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space seh that is good that's what I need eh
we just need a different type of um router ya
ya
kan that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
mm
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
how many wifi you have at home
oh you have two
one is at
mm so you are connected to your
parents' one
mm
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
mm
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now ah
err
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one err some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
mm
ah
uh
mmhmm
no just now one is because I had to do a a mini training for this ah tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya lor
then anyways so I am starting another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to
ah ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in err
pay to maintain the the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things ah it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
uh
mm
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
huh
your is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never like you get to experience internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay lah you already pass through the err internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke oh you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
September
ya you're graduating April right
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
it's your choice
mm
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business ah
mm explore your options ya
ya eh not bad seh you went through like different certificates seh
kan kan then then when you have a kid right you when you have a kid right then you can say which one you want to know
I went through all ya
you went through N O uh and higher NITEC then diploma if you take
degree you go degree ah if you go further ah all also you have
oh it runs in the family
uh uh
ya like that ah depends ah what you want
me
mm
ya lah that is because they have the knowledge
they don't just like assume oh I am from

I got no motivation so ya

I learn makeup from TikToks and it helps a lot
only use on your sweaty area which I think your cheeks don't need any
mm
I think that now my makeup stays stays longer now
cause I only use powder I only use foundation over here
over here and over here

every time I ask you for things
where's Odella now Odella was like everywhere
people still buy
did you all lose weight if through using the that Odella
a lot ah how many
how many kilo you lost
wah in one month
but
what you wanted wasn't weight loss then what you wanted
really now did you get your already
is that
oh
then you thought you dropped out

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
mm
so what the batman need to do from
actually
burdensome

let's say
thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws

the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal

campus radio
honestly say honestly say

based on experience ah just saying
okay
free
huh
okay one thing that I wish was free
err
it'll be hard ah
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
yes yes eh actually that's very good points ah a'ah sia healthcare
mmhmm

wait that's the sad thing plus also it's not really a guarantee that they will do a good job kan that's another thing
no offence but like don't want say shade also to other countries but most of them also a bit uh corrupt eh
honestly don't need to work to survive
then does that mean like what we don't need to
um grow our plants

okay diaper full also ya

hi hamzah
uh no contract ah
um ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
um
every month
pay fifty five so it's almost double ah
okay bottom western epitope so calculate um mahjong
what okay two years eh so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months kan about extra seven hundred dollars ah kan
but iphone eleven uh how much ah iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one lah I think thirty two
okay
um
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free eh same ah same um
twenty I think
I think
maybe less than ten ah maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
um ya lah almost four years ah
ah that's why
ah sorry again
oh but but that time kan that time I pergi tu apa um challenger kan iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven ah but seven also like
also present lobang ah no haunted
ah no contract
but
no but
oh oh K then
oh
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
mm
but
ya but now starhub plan ah the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
oh
oh then uh how how's your job search
then um
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now eh all the interview ah
the developer they eh you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test kan
oh
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
mm
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
ah I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
ah what is the maximum lah the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm ah kan because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit ah pointless kan
so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent ah but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know um ya
join the company like this
ah mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

test and
okay hi I'm amir I and my partner salamah
okay so first conversation was how
a bit
but I think it's the perfect time ah
I mean when it comes to like face mask from what
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth lah
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time ah I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend lah
you you imagine you
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it what like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay ah so I think the house fly was
ya I guess so I was fine
ya you don't know meh
ya lah it's just that I got the most freshest one lah
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license lah my motorbike license like
I
I don't
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement lah but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is like way better lah
it's not a tipping thing ah like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean you cannot
that one is they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think like the their
like it's just
ya I got it for six eh four hundred plus lah like because
I mean long term ah and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
ya ya
I mean
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
blind blind spot
I I think I might feel fail someone from the the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing ah
ah
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
you license ah you
so you know how the the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out ah as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe ah
so I think
but before that defensive riding lah
so
ya
but I think I
ya
no
ya
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I I think the bike I'm looking for is err the one like my friend is riding I think one five zero or one five
ya ya okay that one I
I I don't even know what
those brands are like ah because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the I mean somewhat fuel efficient is one five zero ah
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years ah
like I I need to decide first whether because like if I were to do my work
ya
I just keep renting ah depends on like what bike I want then
like at the at the like a dead end
what was the question I have to remember oh was it something like okay what is the
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
um
like
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
so I think
ah ya
I mean I am okay grand if it's just the person that I want
ya
ya lah I mean but like honestly
like like what you say lah or whatever if the person has done but then ya lah but
like you have to know what the person like intention of what a birthday is lah for me
they have to know lah like like it's not gonna be feasible lah for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay lah whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday lah a holiday or something eh
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do lah a road trip
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker lah it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
oh
okay ya so ya lah I mean wait this six hundred is a lot lah so

talking because
you
but if I talk and then you don't respond to me then what's the point of me talking
okay but so are you checking it now
should we just end it how do we end it do we just stop or what
now
okay okay okay

I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to um another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
mm
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you ah they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
ah so
yes ya
then you can you can use their err
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you lah I'm not sure about your personal one but my school one has like
um my school's background
err you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show lah
mm
K
mm
so when you click share screen right
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
it will show everything that I go
everybody can see that
but
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share lah share
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
ah you stop share lah
ya so you just stop share
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
mm
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say um they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that one is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
allow
she chose don't allow
pick the stop video I mean I mean ah like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
mm
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
thumbs up thumbs down
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands uh put down your hands yes no
err thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs ah hands up
ya usually at the participants area lah
ya then like just now you can like
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want siti instead
so siti ya and then other basic things is err okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
okay so you can choose between like err record on your laptop or record on cloud
and then I had to record the classes
ah I chose
the first mistake was I chose uh to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
mm so so I had to I had to
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
mm ya
and then some basic things like chat
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host uh even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which err will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
uh instead of everyone there's like person ah other people's name all the participants' name lah then they will have like bracket privately
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
it will be altogether
mm ya but that's just like
mm other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
forty people
so I will just
I'll just be like err there will just be a notification that pops out uh proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait lah
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
mm
mm I guess so lah but like
cause
I get
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just err
it will just be somewhere here lah
like ya
google meet or live outlook something like that lah
mm
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people lah
mm
but just now you had you had something on
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
mm but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries lah
ah
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
ah
oh
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
huh
the gavin err
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation what
oh then the escape room is they create or what
welfare pack kan everything is online now what so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff ah
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with lah so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like err cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical one or something like that but like
maybe maybe ya then they
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather um if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay what to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that lah
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried lah we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that lah like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
mm
and then like initially I wanted to
uh produce like three different
to produce one instead
engage in home-based businesses
like it was supposed to be
release
oh it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of uh
they open lah but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
err we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
woohoo
ya our target was four hundred dollars
four courses a'ah
err each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my um
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half lah like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible what it's not to rely on like
kan so like that's what he said lah he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
mm but ya not not there yet not as
mmhmm mm
ya then we're like that's quite true lah
um no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is oh third is excel and forth is um
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like err in our faculty there was there's another group
oh by the way I won a giveaway from them
ya it's a just a makeup set lah ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
oh ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
ya
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course lah ya
and then fast forward err
like
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him lah I was like oh will you be interested oh I ask his number from my friend and then after that ah I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
ah but ya it's just it's
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
uh two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like uh extra class notes and he even like answered err post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
oh but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
oh he was err he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like uh ya
prestigious one lah but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
mm really meh
mm okay lah ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like wow
how is someone that smart
ya
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
oh the Staple B is it
bento set
oh
mm
but like what does his dish contain
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
oh
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at novena
so is that good
oh
how is going to earn from that
ah
so food court lah
that's basically a food court
mm
that's a food court
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
mm no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
ah it's focus more if your if your room is conducive lah but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all what I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
like I don't even know how people study in tampines hub
the basement kan you're talking about the basement right
ya the is twenty four hours what
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
oh no cause COVID then now they
oh but library now they open
I think
bugis the national library and like some bigger national libraries like tampines library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online lah
like I don't mind studying outside but
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is oh my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that one my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams err assignments to do
six
all different lah so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
twenty four hours ah
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can lah but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you lah but
like it's not not
neh
no but it was
it was so much time lah I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
huh
no lah
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
oh you look at
exactly ya
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
oh no but
but one thing bad about online school was that err
orh okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module lah but
ah generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
no the answer is no
oh that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
like err
about the same so let's say
in this uh my first mod then my second mod right I have like um my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
um let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like eh it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like yay no exam fun what then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like huh why I never knew until I experience it
and my major err
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words lah
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major one
and then two thirteen november okay then this one is okay lah relax lah
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two lah but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam what like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time lah then now I think
some period
now and
two eh no week six that's the crazy period lah cause that's the like now now is my chiong period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster lah
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
that's that
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
err result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
mm
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you lah
ya
huh
oh no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments kan
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case lah cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that what then I think they don't want lah
ya but
I guess it's it's okay lah
like
mm will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did lah
ya
ya
it's like
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni lah I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay lah I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
ya and then after that
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
mm
mm
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like oh
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
uh our sem two kan sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email lah they said like oh like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
so they said cannot lah like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there lah
ya
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything lah
but the thing is my
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again lah cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
you have to wait
you have to wait another year lah so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do um online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause uh you're it's actually taking
right
no it's not
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if uh
they don't let
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck lah we just we just trying to ask but
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then um the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
and obviously the school will not allow it lah
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore what if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can lah which is damn unfair cause it's just like
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
eh
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous lah
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first ah so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options ah to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay lah no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now what it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
oh ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision what remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya oh did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know lah
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report lah
ya but no the thing is
mm like cause some people notice like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
then like people like
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything lah
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know ah just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
uh what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release err a statement lah saying like oh increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know lah look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
um my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like oh like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous lah
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report lah like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic ah
like everytime another one comes and then like uh yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that what

hello my name is hady
hello faidil um how have you been
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have um the first question for you my first question is um just the other day I was walking outside um an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone ah that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself um I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its um
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
um for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
so ya that's my opinion
um my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with err the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
ah ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
um ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
um ya um that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who um don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash um just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
mm yes
um that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with um the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why um I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
um temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest um mind reading um I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
um
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
um ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
ah ya before I say the three skills I master I um I agree with your last point about being able to
um be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
hmm
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and um you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great um I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
um ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring aziz ansari
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe um five hundreds days of summer
starring um zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
um ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
um ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp um I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste ah so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
um my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty um console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
um
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
um ya lah um
just
I can't I can't really think of what else lah to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with faidil as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said lah um I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time ah
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question um my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
wishes
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be um being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club lah cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
um if I had a third wish I would just um in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily um for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
um if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe wagyu beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
um
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always um
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
um um
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
um wow um those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think lah obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten lah what about you
um ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
um wow um first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek um a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
it's just a waste of a life ah and what's your thoughts
um ya for sure um I feel like
um the awareness itself about mental health is very important um obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you faidil

ya
ya
this one got the half half

oh that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
april kan lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
oh so which mulan have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would mulan do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched lah but I don't remember lah kan
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about mulan
so mulan kan
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
woman is not required to go for this one what this one
ya woman cannot go
but then why is she forced to go
oh okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
I watched before
no no no I watched already you see
mulan go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then err
then the
ah sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check err then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander err leader ah
meh she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie what right
she got caught in the
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
hans
so is mulan like
based on the real life
let's finish the mulan first lah
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
wushu finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay wushu
wushu
okay wushu then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand mulan first then I'll make you understand aladdin
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
oo makes sense
nineteen sixty five eh
wow that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about aladdin
okay ah honestly I think it's stupid ah because
okay because
she don't let me drink water ah
cause he
cannot meh
then you want me talk for one hour no drink ah
huh
okay
this one guy
eh wait how's the show ah
how how did he find the lamp
at the lion place
ya the lion cave
know your facts man
okay whatever okay
so in the
err go inside the movie eh go inside the cave
then he climb climb climb get the lamp then he rub the lamp ah
he met the genie inside he met the genie inside the cave
ya
ya
ya
you know aladdin is the monkey what
aladdin was just like on the cliff
tell me your wish
then they sing a song
but I don't know the song is in the original movie or not is there a song in the original movie
then they sing song
then they rub then he rub rub rub already ask for the first
that was the monkey's first wish
ya that was the genie's first wish
oo
okay whatever then after that
the three the three wishes no we have to end this
podcast
know your facts
the first one is is he wants to be a prince of
mm I don't know lah what's the name
you asked what
ya I'm telling you how it goes
so the three wish is the want to be prince
then second wish
was it was it about the girl no it wasn't about the girl
no you let you tell me the second wish first then we talk about something else
ya renovation kan

ah
I don't know why ah that time when I went kan they just ah
there wasn't a lot of people on a weekend
ya I went on the weekend
okay the slides are out
that's what I know ya
if I'm not wrong lah they closed down the slides like all the slides
I don't know lah I I I need to ask the maintenance guy
main slides are out the
tsunami
maybe because we're grown up already lah
then err there's so there's only that that tsunami

how to say ah
I don't know ah got there's just a lot of stupid thing I did in secondary school
then my class was just winning like every single game ah
I don't know how
okay you imagine this triangle eh
then you draw two lines inside
so this is the field this is the goal this is the goal so maybe you just throw to your team mate that's in this uh right rectangle he score
so what my team did
so
I will just in the middle again all I had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
okay
so once you okay let's say I scoring this eh I scoring here eh
I will throw to one guy at the back
this one guy at the back
just throw to him
ya just throw to daniel
ya but daniel lah
and then catch and we win
one point
ya
then fasting some more then I play frisbee ah quite tired ah can I drink
sports day ah come on
then she say ah okay okay lah you drink lah
ya
after P six I don't know what got into me kan I became like the leader
ya
hannah right
mm normal lah
actually my secondary school like drama
but then because
I think in most is situation I was the middle man in that fight
I was never the person that caused the fight
like the drama
oh there was a drama that inflicted the whole cohort
in the whole lah I think
mm
what did hannah do
okay okay
sorry
ya
aww

that will probably be naz

okay
okay
oh in school
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
from okay P one P two kan I was in a different school

ya I have to ask dewi to do research lah then from there
ya lah and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding mah
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
mm
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause err lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
mm okay
ya

okay
ah I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
err
that is the main main core concept
oh I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
ah that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about err one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty ah then whole lunch ah then in between before the one thirty starts right err we have the walk in lah then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans lah some activity lah so for about ya
katong and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle

I haven't decided whether to
to stay stick with the same class or
change
ya I think but less movement now lah
less moving around in school
shouldn't be lah it should be easier for the teachers
during this period

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see
okay
wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
ah both ah
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
but I mean it's a bit late for for prata simpang bedok ah
you don't know mahamoodiya

I was looking through our the booking right
ya okay
because the one that I found was
the same place because
okay err
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus ah below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think only four lah right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so err
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the uh call um membership
so he got discount lah
ya
that one is sofitel is at tanjong pagar
very near what the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around there's a lot of cafes there also what
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there lah
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon lor
yup
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya lor
ya oh ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week lah I see how lor technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya oh ya last year we had the what
ya no but whenever tanjong pagar theme
don't know
I don't know lah maybe theme
oh ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
ya
oh really ah
from which err supermarket
ya
sheng siong sheng siong also hard sia
I mean you see my area around down here there's no sheng siong the nearest is bukit panjang mall
giant lah since we just with brandon
eh last year we did giant
aiya
eh ya ya
so what
ya I remember the cause I think got more things to buy
mm
who's the free one ah
can you plan
please
you have to be codes
this is not chinese new year
dinner
but now buffet very irritating ah
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
mm
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
oh ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
oh ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
okay
oh ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that lah they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely lah I mean you cannot meet lah but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
oh ya just five of us lah
without partners lor
mm
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us what
korean ya that ah
farin birthday
oh
oh yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners lor that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya okay
ya
um
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work lah
ya
mm
ya lor
monday right
is it really
ya
oh
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
hais
okay lor we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred oh my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred sia
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
whoa but luckily I went taiwan sia just before lockdown
ya
err not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
hais
hais ya
ya
eh but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
um ya
but you know the that time the who say ah which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably lah elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations lah wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel lah
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
was there lah oh my god
mm
err they have another issue to tackle there oh my god
mm
are you talking about succulent
oh
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
mm
oh I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what sia cardboard
oh what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
hais anyway I have an assignment on an essay lah so I need just err your your point of view lah I guess
mm it's about um
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
mm
ya
true leh ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
mm
ya
mm
good what lockdown good what I was enjoying the period
mm
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems lah rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
oh
ya
mm
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel lah like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation lah so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway err
ya lah alhamdulillah I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this err to convert their platform store into online platform lah so
mm
true I mean you will lose your human touches also lah right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
err
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all lah like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along lah hundred percent get along so
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one wah then
ya
right ya
mm
ya obviously
ya
mm
true
mm
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better lah because you know carbon footprints were reduced lah I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit lah of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight lah like just
ya
ya
ya
okay lah at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress lah I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit leh
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
mm
ya
maybe they did lah like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors lah what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
mm
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes lah but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya eh can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society lah I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case lah on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water one
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito one
it's true okay lah but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down lah
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel lah at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot leh
is it
aren't we not at the top
oh we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest lah
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to lah but it's not possible lah per se
oh my god
oh that one that they kill all the animal ah but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus what ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens mah
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
mm
uh huh
ya inside the middle ah
uh huh
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese err ah swiss cheese plant
stop it lah
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times leh
what is a prayer plant
mm
ya
mm
but monstera is an indoor plant what right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
mm
ya
ya
technically they are bushes lah weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
not really leh
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt leh
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer lah but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
err the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk leh like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also what light can ah
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can ah
ya probably can lah I don't know
I don't know it just grows short lah from small to big lah I guess shoots ya
hais
no oh my god that one
no meh
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
ah
mm
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office uh condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
aiya very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
aiya you don't know one lah
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
mm oh my god
mm
hais
mm
spray is it then
mm
ah
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
mm
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also what if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
mm
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
mm ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die sia
hmm
oh my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough lah too much plants ah mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant eh
oh no
aiya you don't know one lah
it's like a fern anyway
hais
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow
like for for the whole week to say
ya lor
is it at westgate
only if it's got ah
what christmas thing
who oh your ex company ah
I see alright cauliflowers
oh
not outside location ya true normally right you have to like
true true
hais
I also haven't buy yet you know
I got three
you know who's my
office santa this year
naz again
it I don't know what to buy for her it's like running of ideas you know there's no theme can buy anything it's just have to be like more than thirty dollars or something like that
cannot be less than thirty
ya then it's like cannot be less than
but technically they don't like understand why is it called like you know inflation and then
err haven't planned yet eh for everything leh
socks
mm
ya
why
oh my god
oh my god stop it it's so funny
oh what's full time ah oh
oh
wah my full time ah
ya
definitely
how old is she ah
mm

ya
but then I feel like december kan school holiday
mm ugh
mmhmm
Pan Pacific service suite
um beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
mmhmm
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book kan
that's why they follow like
ya
eh eh sorry sorry
mmhmm
I think it's easy seh if you get like central
a'ah
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
oh
mm
is that the kitchen then
and then
uh
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya correct
oh
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also lor
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that lor
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
uh huh
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think angah will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
oh is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since angah like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
mm can ah
at Noosh Noodle Bar
eh we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
mm okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy ah
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
ah okay
mmhmm
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it lah twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
um measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this yakiniku you know yakiniku
the beef
Yoshinoya
oh no okay yakiniku is the
okay lah like that is after they yakiniku the beef mah
but yakiniku is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they yakiniku it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal yakiniku outlet
the asakusa temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was wagyu then I'm like
it's so soft oh my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically lah but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like mee soto is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose mee soto okay I think I will pick
um
a'ah there's like so many things that I like
hmm
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will eh she eh she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya lah so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
a'ah
a'ah seh
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
oh my god
a'ah
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
oho like the circuit breaker
a'ah
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
oh my god
a'ah
that's why
a'ah
and then they have
a'ah movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
aiya I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
a'ah
mmhmm mm mm
ah
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then ah if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
um
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like uh
a'ah
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
err you still not a
uh huh
I like crime documentaries
a'ah a'ah
court cases
mmhmm correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that um
a'ah
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
uh like you know I don't ya
it really happened
a'ah the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's huh
that she covered
uh huh a'ah ah
I haven't really watch
uh
mm kids
oh the movie is just recently
oh okay okay okay okay okay
oh okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
mmhmm
stress
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
and she effectively you know
expecting
mm
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
mmhmm
or is it
okay like when you
ah okay okay
a'ah a'ah
true
castle
like
a'ah
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
oh
mmhmm
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
father daughter or like kids
mmhmm
what is it oh your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think uh
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like oh
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a duh
oh ya ya ya
sembawang
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
a'ah
a'ah
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries lor
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card lah
I think they like
people
from other working at other places eh like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under lah then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
oh um we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
because it's also what
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's mah
I mean like okay lah if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day uh
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your uh at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like huh
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
uh can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
hmm)(hmm
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand lah but then you know some people when they like
a'ah
that's why I say
ah
because now
now also everything is online
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
need to go down mmhmm
a'ah
ya it's like that so yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the um financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot lah because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
mm ya
at the
ya
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
issues with the
employers
ah
because they um employees from different different company mah so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
uh
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like oh
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office what
just be mentally prepared lor
mm
no lah
mmhmm
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
dah
that time you went for the medical interview ah
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower lah basically
oh okay
oh really
oh okay
oh it's at a landed property
oh okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
oh okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no
do you have to teach them anything or no
oh okay
five
oh
okay okay okay
youngest
then
but then they have different age groups
oh okay okay
child care
mmhmm
uh
oh okay
oh okay
oh okay and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh like um japanese and get japanese korean and sweden that swedish within
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
uh
oh
a'ah
this one more to the that one ah
ah
is it because the cost is higher or
then how is your like working hours like
oh office hours
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
oh okay
uh
mm mm mm mm
three teacher oh ya
mmhmm
mm
mm mm mm mm

no lah it was more of the guy I forgot what's his john something
it it's switzerland I forgot what's the guy's name shit but ya you have to remember the different geneva conventions things like that
so like in a way I guess I was learning
I guess I guess in a way I eh I I guess in a way I was learning about sociology early in the day lah oh actually ya now I know why I pick sociology LOL but ya
it was interesting it's just that my special ya like I said lah are my specialisation was red cross knowledge and first aid I was gonna take an evac gold but
I
I got sick I got sick during my first aid goal and my evac gold the test because we had to go to the to take the like test lah but I was sick I couldn't make it so I was like I only had like
everything was bronze except for my ah red cross knowledge ah I found it I was sad but at the same I didn't give a
I didn't care
I mean at that time lah I mean who cared lah right
eh what was your scene secondary school
first school
mmhmm
oh captain's ball
cook right
you didn't have to take home econs as a subject no eh for us it was compulsory everyone had to take home econs D&T
but ya I mean in primary school right I didn't take per se because my school like sports right was a compulsory like
you know like you had to take different music we had to learn different musical instruments you had to learn different sports I had to learn floorball
uh huh
uh huh
shit your basic really zero
stay in stay in beat ah
oh
is it like was it F F
or something I don't remember I don't remember I don't remember I honestly don't remember it was such a long time
oh ya the the
I had to learn in primary school
recorder ah the long one flute is at the side ha then uh
oh ya then in secondary school my school ask us to learn gamelan I I I was in charge of the big gong
not the big gong is like one side is smaller than the other side is bigger you know that what oh no it's the I I at first I was gong I was in charge of the gong
then what ah I was in charge of the gong but it's like
um
I forgot what's the name but ya I I was in charge of the gong but it's like
no it's uh fusion so they mix malay chinese indian dance
they mixed it around lah I mean I wasn't a fan of dancing I mean I learnt dancing before it's just that
tchoukball or something is it the one you throw them net they had through at the net
I don't remember floorball tchoukball I don't remember ya I mean we did play uh captain's ball a lot I was always the goalkeeper
cause I was great at catching balls I was good at no pun intended but ya ya ya I played a lot frisbee uh I played basketball in secondary school then rugby was like my final like touch rugby was my final
we learn
okay lah
that's why in like you know secondary school I was so fit then the moment I went to poly I gained so much weight because I didn't do the same amount of physical activity I was eating I was still having like unhealthy lifestyle I slept like like irregular eat irregularly also ya it's okay now I can tell people I tried a lot of things that's why I tell people what I'm a jack of all trades master of none
but ya I think primary school and secondary school there's a lot of like ghost stories sia ya especially you know you go to camps
do you do you have any camps like do you guys have any like
ha okay you continue
oo
mm
we loved it
yes
is it that's not really horror though more of thriller right it's the it's the kid who pretended to it's the adult who pretended to be a kid right because she had some disorder right
oh
oh shit
ah
it's it's like haunted house lah kan it's like it's like during our camp lah kan
yikes
faci faci
he stare at you no I mean for me my night walk I mean I had a I had like camps lah primary school
what is it ah
one of the the the the guys right one of the army one of the army stories
no not the not the one that the guy died with the the not with the intestines all over the floor one it's the other one is the the one that he offended the offerings or something then
ya because he mummy boy ya that place lah the that that place they used as like the no it was at a camp I don't remember but I think it's now closed is it sarimbun is sarimbun closed I don't remember it was I think sarimbun because I remember sleeping on those bunks
ya but ya when I had those night walks right it was
okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks tau
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk ah
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say eh uh
it started out fine but it's like err when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
kan if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
aik
mm
yikes
they just stayed there lah so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
uh huh cause I watched that one
mmhmm
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess err I don't know lah I mean allahu alam ah eh
that's why I say I don't know you go Google lah I don't know what else ah
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean uh you hear stories that sometimes inside the
mm they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right eh no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it lah
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so mm I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
mm
mm
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also what they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while uh psychological study said that oh it's just like uh was it what seh
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said what they can uh what is it ah they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night lah around four
what
no shit oh hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby oh my god ha
mm that's why ah
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the uh door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia lah you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think oh I don't know I do know there some bomohs in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise ah
mm
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff lah but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay lah it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya oh because it will like corrode or something is it oh ya ya
okay
but ya
I don't know some
ah ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
err accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
mmhmm
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
ha
I don't know I mean depends on the family uh because you are unless
you not supposed to say this lah but unless the
pass to you
no lah what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement lah basically you are agreeing what if you nod it's a form of agreement what no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say eh
I
lame okay and my mum said lah my mum said lah eh she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real

oh what was the last movie you watched on netflix
mmhmm
oh
house
don't know
oh it's a comedy
mm haven't watch it
wah
true
ya that's true
huh oh
ah
I think the last movie I watched was movie eh I haven't watch movies in awhile but I watch like series
ya
the acting is not that great the the also not that great lah but
no it's british ya
it's quite interesting lah I mean the storyline also not that amazing but it passes time
ya
the boys
on netflix
oh
oh
mm
oh
okay
mmhmm
mm
mm
like what what's the storyline about like what basically happen
okay
amazon prime I don't have sia but might I might subscribe cause got a lot of like interesting shows I've heard and netflix is like running out of stories
isn't much left
ya
amazon prime
orh
ya
mm
interesting
mm
I know you take forever to watch a show
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm true
mm
I think they did it was like fourteen the last time now it's like sixteen
oh great
haiya it went up
ya they added now
ya
mmhmm that day I received this
ya but I don't know ah I think not yet
true
mmhmm
oh
oh wow
what is it about
but what is your course like mainly about
huh okay
oh yes
I mean that's fun I guess managing a business
mm
uh huh
mm that's true
I don't know
I mean
oh ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
oh how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
mm
mm
then what happens
true
mm mm
mm
but like
sad sia they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market uh like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game eh without the players what do you have like an empty online page
mm
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
and that's what has been happening what like the
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
kan
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
ya
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that lah
ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
it's probably him ya
I don't know sia
ya and he spent so much on that game also what I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
oh ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want sia
I don't know
cute sia
oo is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
kumbhakarna
yes
mmhmm
mm
oo
and another person orh
hmm that's hard good looks or fit body
mm
then yourself leh
mm
yes
ya
true
true
mm
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
good looks
ya
hmm
no any other day hmm
and
ya
oh ya not not bald lah no lah like as in like short
I don't know I
mmhmm
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
but ya
ah
um
mm ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
like tag along so like
huh really I didn't know
oh you didn't say
did you say oh I didn't see
I didn't
oh no he means he can't even play at all ya
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
ya
mm
just one mm
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
ya so you like
mm
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
kan
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
oh
I guess
I guess
mmhmm
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to ah like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
yishun
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
ya let's go look for that cow later
is there
interesting we go find out lah
kan
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
oh
I mean the
I mean there's still one that exists that like
she owns the place basically and then like uh
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened lah when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
mm ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like oh I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then ah they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall lah and then like um
her features were like pretty lah like
like a model person's features
mm that part that was the one lah
ya
mm ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying lah cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
then we just like like we told them lah like oh we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place ah cause it's surrounded by
that hut that looks like a kopitiam
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor lah
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
oh visit huh there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
the there's a road that goes through the entire place lah so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people lah
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like paiseh ah cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
and then um
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
ah but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice ah it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
um
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting ah the place
interesting
um
I honestly don't know ah I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night lah
ya I think same ah if like I had to like
true
but
oh ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
mm
mmhmm
really
that's interesting
uh the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes sia is it even open I think it is already lah if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
pulau semakau that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent lah ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
orh orh
catty
catty enclosure
mm
and jumping on things
mm
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed lah like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible lah to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age sia the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from yishun
yishun has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not meh
it was
it was lah cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
uh five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya sia
sec four lah so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
orh
it's quite pretty lah the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and changi airport
hmm
that's a hard question
but legit lah like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
oo
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
hmm
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job oh my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
mmhmm
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
mm
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
oh ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
mm
ya previous
mm money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
mmhmm
mm
so what the hell
wow
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
oh
mm
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
mm
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it ah so like
probably not
mmhmm
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
mm
mm
no one was interested
ya
mmhmm
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay lah to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
mmhmm
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like oops
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
mm
mm
mm
true
mm
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
mm
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
orh
same
I just I cannot imagine like
oh
I was like huh
ya
oh that's weird
the hell
mm
mm
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
orh
mm
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
mm
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad lah like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it lah but like it's fine uh it's fine lah he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
oh really
orh
I mean get scared lah like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine lah like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
mm
mmhmm
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic what then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die lah confirm but like
oh
mm
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
mm
is put to use
ya
mm
somewhere else
that needs it
mm
mm
mm
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
ah ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
oh well
ya sia and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical sia like how
why
mmhmm
are we
bye bye

eh liz
haiya liz
ah
as in like she comes back as in like trying to contact me and my family all lah
like this ah
you they will do some software thing on this thing lah like this ah
doesn't matter
no
and she sent her photos about her wedding and all that
and usually she she never really ask about me
now suddenly she start asking about me lah
no
I asked sheryn lah what are her intentions
her stuff lah
but she the thing is that
that's why

like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like mm
don't know what to do ah
okay then once my

I print err not print I search for all the
err err what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig

one choice a bit too little lah so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and ah eh is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay err maybe I I put two ah so one was
infocomm security then the second one was

that um the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about err entertainment or something ah
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should ah so
ya that was when I realised ah so
what I did was I
like uh screw it ah I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like oh okay
ya I only applied for one option lah I only put one choice

I see as a I see it as the is it am I too soft or what
blessing in disguise will you say
like you know how he like you say ah is like okay um
revolves around teamwork
team collaboration
team effort
okay so
now
the moment COVID strike
everything is done online on Zoom meetings
whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can um collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like err this current time this current period is like the the most
err hardest ah I feel
ya
uh huh
something like that
err honestly eh I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap
I mean I'm still losing money ah that's the main thing ah
uh I mean I guess you can say this recording ah
no lah I mean
honestly speaking I'm trying to look for a job I applied for a job but right now
okay at first I feel like okay at first I thought okay ah maybe I should try to apply something related to what
I want to do in the future
then okay so I look look look see see see for any like opening cause like
most of the people that they're looking for are like oh two three years of
err the experience that you are
relevant ya then I was like what
ya lah ya lah I mean
I can apply but okay you know the
the united
uh traineeship or something like that programme
okay so
okay
august like I was like okay ah
ah maybe I'll get my one more pay in september
you know
you know that that that expectation okay ah so I was like I didn't
I didn't bother to look for any jobs ah during august to september
um early september
like
last month lah
okay okay okay sorry sorry
okay so
I expected september
to get my last pay ah but
then I I I ask me
I ask my lah eh can you help me check
err are we supposed to get paid uh september then he was like ah okay okay I'll get back to you
then after that
ah he he came back and then he said oh no your
how they pay is like
ya you're paid for that
month that you're working
rather than
uh something like that maybe
so
then I was like oh shit
that means like I won't get paid lah on the september
ah
ya
what is that
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
wow
not bad not bad
Adidas eh
ah okay
oh
eh ah
oh oh oh oh
my bad my bad no I I I I mistaken sorry sorry
sixth october that's
I think about a week from now
ah
cause um
bill from their system
okay
so then uh the the person in charge they like oh err
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like oh err are you still are you still in are you still serving
then I was like oh ah I just finished I just like
last week then she was like uh okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme oh man
that was like ninety eight dollars
hais
ya lah
ya lah of course ah I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
mm huh
hais
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that one is before err ah but six months is a very long
think so I don't know lah
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing ah
a'ah
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work ah honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
eh I would not think twice
I just
ya serious ah
one last talk
oh I see
oh I see
uh huh
a'ah
I see I see
no lah okay so uh
and then
to eh no sorry my
and then basically then go up to ah so there's this
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
err
err expect a lot from the from us ah
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
a'ah ya
and okay so you know how in
err they say oh okay err the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the one doing all this err
all these checks right correct
uh huh okay
so we also have the
we also had the schedule lah
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
err the one that we don't like lah
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about err the duty err is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
then
so this directing staff came down he was like oh err what time already I was like huh
what do you mean he's like err why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like huh
what you expect sia you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check ah
you get what I mean
ya lah
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check ah rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like ha
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
so we're like err when when I going it was like ah don't care already ah because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already ah
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies ah
um
okay okay
what you have done lah ha
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
oh don't have eh
okay then I guess err
mmhmm
okay lah but okay that

then I go they change the plan then I feel bad what then it's like uh just go ahead lah without me
yeah
um yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
then they were like never mind lah you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
mm
that's why ugh
same is like they
oh my god yeah

I mean
then it depends on your station also lah
mm
I think it's a very how to say ah first world problem I feel
mmhmm
right yeah
mm yeah
that's true
I
exactly then that's why I think it's considered a million dollar like idea I guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then I'm mm
no no you can
which is
yeah
mmhmm
yeah
mm that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
mm
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad lah because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
mm
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened lah like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like hmm I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh my gosh
mm
oh my gosh
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
mm
oh my god can you imagine me

yeah it's
I don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that I have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah I'm like um
ah yeah
mm
yeah yeah
mm
mm
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
ah yeah yeah
err
I mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
uh yeah
mmhmm
uh
oh my gosh
then
then then it's like should I be sad that there's no customers or should I be glad that there's no customers
mm
very easy money
hmm
I mean that's considered one of a good like working days I guess
uh yeah
that's true
oh
oh

you are the one who made it
like
uh
I mean
mm understand

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
ugh
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go uh university exchange because look at rifqi he's still so close with his two friends like eh I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
wah
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december eh
and this sem okay lah given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast
I cannot I really cannot
okay

yes
because it can be done in like thirty dollars for like something that will cost seven hundred and fifty here

singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids

I don't even know how you broke your phone that day you know I really don't
I wasn't even drunk that day I just don't get how you oh I think I know when
when you was getting at andre's lobby and you fell remember
your phone didn't fold in half lah the screen just crack lah
try we I should just wait so you mean she at home you get ahead you they they can repair or ability or or go with their iphone or cold air cool white apron sky then err I don't know last night eh I really don't know eh you give exists food opposite the airport who got a C is you know what
I don't know
I really don't know how you broke your phone I cannot like to this day sometimes I really like think about it tau I retraced you know like every single thing we did that day
not once did we see your phone come out eh
huh
you're not that troublesome to me ah
all you had was one glass sial
wake boarding
you know my swimming skills are so terrible
my swimming skills a very terrible
I will still be able to drown trust me
I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya

mm
mm
maybe
yes but the thing is
ya lah you you have to follow tightly to their
to the schedule
okay so why do you want to go to
scotland
okay
so they project the country very well lah in that
interesting noraini
thank you for sharing with me
and
do you know what I see next
it's um a package eleven days and eight nights
and the heading is spectacular scandinavia
ya that was like
last year's planning
yes
ya sweden right eh no
no no I didn't go to
mm mm
yes
I flew to sweden first
ya
so from stockholm I stay a few nights there
explore the city
how fate brought you together
yes and and you know what what they put here
fish market
ulriken cable car it's the one that we took right ulriken and bryggen but bryggen is what is it the along the
coast
bryggen B R Y G G E N
I do
mm
ya
so here they said set off on an epic journey to the nordic countries where you will see the capitals of denmark sweden and norway so I recall that time the the guide right
ask us like what's the
what's um which countries
are in the scandinavian which countries are ya
navia
ya
which as finland
so it's actually denmark sweden and norway
these three are the scandinavian countries
uh
actually colours of the leaves
mm
wait but northern spain
so what are the country
okay
interesting
so he drives I mean
ya actually when that time during the road trip with I mean we engage the driver kan ya
yes
so we can consider chey
or the other alternative
but like what
the not so
but that time you went you oh you went london only
it's okay
oh yes
but eh err portugal is
who ah the
iffah iffah's choice right
is it
ya
she's getting married leh she go with the husband lah
ya
but portugal ya
hais when can we travel ah
uh exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february um coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know leh
no I think should be
I think err mid eh
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like um
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
ah I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall lah but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary ah thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
mm okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya lah griffiths uh primary is the one next to my place ah
ah
no no ya now renamed to angsana
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
angsana griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
ah speaking of which
ah
ah
then err
ya
okay lah
ya
so anyway like that ah so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
oh how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
woohoo
wah
so the kid
but he's not present lah for that two months or he's still orh
orh
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer lah in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better lah because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
mm
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
uh ya
oh
ah
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate uh like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals ah
ya uh head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know lah what they do
you know settle some like don't know lah some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching eh
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
orh ah
I think err
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like eh I mean my previous school lah
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
ah
ah
mm mm
mm mm
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
mm
so I mean like there's
wow so deep sia
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
ah
okay
ah ah
so priority according to priority
okay name me three
aww
inshallah
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
mm
I think so I do not know maybe
no ah no
ya
ya why I look different
ya lah it has always been this ya but um
ya
but um
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but eh I think is that one is reading glasses maybe
ya
eh it has this listing eh it will stick
orh
orh
orh
then then
hmm
eh that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there ah the one
ya
okay what nice what so when you sleep you will switch on that light
orh
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
huh
ah
huh
wait
orh yes yes yes
oh my god one
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it lah now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
orh
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
orh
okay lah ya lah
but uni
ya
because that time I think uh
whether like um like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya lah
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think err central port
it's err geylang geylang
I think ah I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan what east coast plan
ya
I think I think bedok area
eh
ya
mm mm
ya I was like aww
ya
orh
mm no no
ya this one is I think yesterday's story he was just like showing
ya around
I mean it's different lah different vibes lah chey
mm
ah purple line right

little
I don't know I don't know
ya
ya
yes
ya so bring
hmm
mm
oh my I forgot about that
I thought that was to buy for your niece or something
but you have the pump or not
ya I think Daiso has that
ya
ya

wow
siala
young marriages eh
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
oof
like child before marriage
mm
foolish this tough man like
okay wow wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages eh okay I think
something like that ya is like you know err like people said you are so young like you know like obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
divorce
oof
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
then
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
oof that is like
time eh I don't think
I don't know I don't
she again she started to you know go err around
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like wah
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like eh no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot
ya babe but that's you ah like everyone is different also what
okay to me I would say like
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot or not
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot
ah
mm
what ya money wise but go back to that question that you said in papers you can be managed with through papers what then after that then you can build up your life what financially
why
mmhmm
mm
they just sign papers they just get married they think like they're the one you know like each other soul mates sign then
mm
ya
for generation I think like I think it depends on the society ah
so it's like
yes correct workaholics that's the word
mm
mm
mm
mm
that that's what I feel because of like where we live the society that we live in that like that's how we live that's how it is
that's how we grew up like we need money if no money we die
ya

typical lor Grab

why
I don't have a bike I don't have
this scooter also like take up battery
so
and the thing is you know okay like my
places
then I'm like so what I cannot work another job ya
ya so how am I suppose to work
bullshit for for them to want ask to work two jobs
ya
ah
like but our minister said can
the court minister say can
ya
if like that means right is like okay I'm working for full time and then my side business let's say
bake cookies ah let's say ah ah home based ah
side business is bake cookies okay what is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort sia because you do that as a second job
so
so
what do is the good I don't see any good in working into two jobs more income I don't think so
I don't eh I don't really think that sia serious
okay ah let's say you work five days a week okay you work office hours then you have second jobs maybe let's say a part time ah ya part time second job second job is a part time
then maybe you need to work four days a week
then you have to commit one weekend so so in a way actually you are working six days a week less time for your family also sia
I mean obviously no family no problem ah if you have a what
for you
because okay I ask you time or money
mm mm ya
no no no right now money
so they're chasing after money what
ya best choice but like you said forty fifty plus not lonely ah
eh
ya let's say only singapore lah because where else
where else ah
mm
mm
and the fact that singapore don't show the suicidal rates
mmhmm
mm
a'ah

I can't imagine someone going through it because to me it's like too much
behaviour
split personality

hi
my name is Intan and this is weird
later on like the when the government give like the government um announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give uh you
okay well
well as you know lah kan I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January um there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report uh Singapore reported their first case
like we didn't care so err after that when err Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but err my my boyfriend was like the most kiasu of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most kiasu and he was very irritating
and then is like he just insist ah right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know Tokyo is near
Yokohama no is it is it near I mean like err there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in Tokyo lah so
err we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like err luckily we came back right before when err Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and um and whatever
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
so I can balance I can juggle my life with err studies I can keep my time occupied eh and like you know just do my stuff
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her lah but as in like the fact is that like stupid sia you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
oh my god stereotype sia
that's another unwanted
then after that she was like err even at times at times we we I suggest lah okay I say nevermind lah mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked err they they featured some characters like you know um everyday Singaporeans and everything
um like I think one of them was about like uh a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to uh the needy lah basically and uh you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not err feature
food deliverer uh like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like um healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
err like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the uh cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
oh really
oh it wasn't cheap
mmhmm but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
um you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like um not considered
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like err very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
eh what
but in order to in order to get
mm
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that um like
err the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading err um like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
err our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking lah like eh so how ah you think that next year ah no sorry next sem which is like in a month um
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
so so um
err we we were like somehow like quite happy that uh we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then err then we we tested out the Zoom err interface then it of like sucked lah because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then err we had exams
what is that module I took I forgot oh uh it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
so basically we were stuck at home so err like the school has to think about something
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
so this open task err is like
a forty eight hour it opens like uh forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then err it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like err by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on lah
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me ah I personally I rather do myself ah because I know I can do it
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do err
stuff hais like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to lah as in like you know when I left
when I left err when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
eh thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful ah sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work lah
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and oh my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
mmhmm
ugh I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive lah I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up lah you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the err that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it lah okay like my my classmates ah my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life kan
and
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
eh
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay lah I I don't think my my err my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture uh eleven uh sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
and then huh
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time err by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that lah so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on err in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free eh uh huh
mm
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically um err Grab host like have this like err promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer um a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then oh no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
uh the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so err ya
and then err so isn't like basically is this was this uh service available on err Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course lah because now everybody can go out already what
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know Nurul is err Nurul has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya

faster
I mean ya lah that's fine lah that's not part of furnitures
I know I know
I know you tell your mum that our future house is gonna be a zoo
because your mum asked me about it
she said
it she asked me if it's true if I know that you are going to make our future house look like the zoo
and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal
why
but why chickens are not legal
but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours
ya
ah ya lah
so
okay
but why are people asking us to adopt chickens
but I think that one is really now illegal
I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird
but
you wanna be a turtle breeder
I don't think any but I I think not I think I don't think anybody wants to keep turtles for a long time
because they take up a lot of space
they really take up a lot of space
yes
yes can you give me awhile I want turn off the aircon
yes
because
I'm recording
ya I'm recording what
but it is very cold
I don't know I tell you I don't have the remote
but I think is the lowest
yes but I think it's the lowest
I mean like
ya I've never like changed the temperature
before so ya
eighteen
hmm
sometimes
must put air at home
yes
no
no
no
no
no
where

oh oh oh oh oh I can see I can see
ya
what
correct
you are working today
huh
again
until what time
until
four fifteen
at where
do you earn a lot
how much
oh
not bad
not bad
ya
but but what
why you never do the that like like that time you do the afternoon
oh
oh
ya nevermind lah at least as long as like there's money coming in you know
so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
hmm
hmm
you know hanis never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me eh
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want lah
too lazy to talk to her
hais
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how rina always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from sonya that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know hanisah
they have leadership this leadership program lah basically but like
um sofia and rina said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked hanisah how long are you bonded with the school lah and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her ah because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her lah the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only ah ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand ah like twenty two thousand I can understand lah but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already lah anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true what like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her lah I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with sufian and rina what like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare lah she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense what
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand eh
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know lah
I don't know at first she didn't tell me lah today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know lah is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say ah who knows rina she say this you know who knows rina have something planned for me like dude
even if rina has something planned for you rina is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different eh in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss saba
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents ah but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the lah what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see lah and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like lah and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know ah
and okay okay ya

anyway ya so their washing machine problem
I can't reach my washing machine have you seen my house washing machine before
why
ya
anyway ya my house washing machine needs
a lot of pushing
boost boost
like I cannot reach
hmm
so that's the problem
ya
really
I just can't reach
and like almost a lot of washing machines are that height
that top height like cause it's pretty average my house washing machine
so that's why I did this research and I've been wanting to tell you so that's why I said I tell you about it
so so you have to consider it
what
uh huh
what phone
S ten
S ten what
what's that
see I don't keep up the samsung I don't I don't keep up with samsung
mmhmm
there is no iphone seven R
the iphone
oh the X
X
and then the pro and then the big and small ya okay okay what up
the samsung you mean
should I want to sell my iphone eight eh
you think people would buy
you think people will buy
you know like some handphone shops you can sell
I don't know but it's in very good condition no scratch nothing you know
no it's in my cupboard
but I really have it in my thing it's no scratch nothing it's still very good condition
right I can get money why not can put inside my savings
since I touch my saving I touch my savings
what
what
what
say

uh ah
I think
work from home
so everything is at home so
that's why lah I decided to actually go out to eat
oh I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
muay thai
is not going to be there all the time kan
wow
orh
it's very tiring lah
this is during my secondary school time
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then um
I join competition
but do you that um I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
err hmm apparently it's possible lah
whoa
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this one is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
the funny part is kan
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job kan it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
err that actually appreciates you for what you do
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees ah that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so kan
err I was hired
and I have
um like a
specialist diploma
err diploma girl
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot lah
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic lah let's just uh move on because like I find
this type of uh topic kan like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
they don't really get
and then
like
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically lah
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
this is going on
ya lah
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
you know send me to student care
ya
you know
so
ah lah
my job scope
no lah just do bits and pieces of everything
ya lah
so
yesterday
wah
like she's having a lot of fun jer
very sweet lah I find
ya
actually
like
this christmas kan
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird lah like
anniversary
orh
orh
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
huh
that is horrible actually
okay lah my boyfriend
okay okay jer lah
I think he's sweet
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then lah to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
ya that's true
I mean like
hopefully
ya
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
actually
being the
eldest
you want to know why
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything lah like academically wise
so that my brothers can
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's just came out
like
ya
and
like
ya it's it's
different lah like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
wow
um you have to take
the scolding
like
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
ah
so sweet
uh huh
a sign lah actual
um
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do kan is
ah
mm
aduh
salad jer
the nutrition
nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free lah
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family kan you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
huh
bus stop
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
like
like when we grow old
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
I kind of
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
just some simple talks
and she's
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
she's too used to walking out
so like
then she
because of corona then like
the
so she
like weekday she don't actually
but then she still go out
what the heck
like
your leg
actually I
seventy to eighty
around
eh I don't know how old
which ah
ya yes
ya she
like
you work your whole entire life
you know
and like not like
for her
I think um
then
scenery
you
you know what's funny
even
I find
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an err we like whoa
like I don't know I I think like
very simple
like
I don't even like
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about it's like
oh ya the ferris wheel the houses
there's something that is
calling out to me
true lah
that's true
now that
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it lah
I mean
I have seen
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
you look at these families
and then you like
they they really like
like
are they doing well
like
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard kan
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
financially
ya
ya
hopefully ah like
ya
actually I have
find all these like
but I do have a
plan in mind
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
you have to know
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
in that area
ya
I also
that one year right
university
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
that one year gap
like
put in effort to really go all out kan
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november jer pe you know
I
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university lah
wow
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I hoping to get marketing
ya
ya lah
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better
you know like I don't know like turn over rate
like lesser or something you know like
it's hard lah
to to know how does the hiring works
they are not okay with
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish lah in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
illegal
illegal movies I don't know lah no lah it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
god has
plans for you
confirm
I can see
I can foresee you being happy in the future lah
so
okay back
to stranger things
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
then you get the fun out of it because
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life kan
you're cutting
ya
I
on my four
overcome
I
the younger one
youngest
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
the invest on
rely on dividends
actually I not so sure
okay lah

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it
mm
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private kan the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's
two point
and the two points is unlimited or I thought there's a limitation kan
alah commoner
two point two point two point
fuh
outside one ah
non spicy ah
regular is meat ah mixed with
bring a bottle I have a lot of your bottles at home sia I think I have four five bottles at home

dishonest ah
that is it will look bad ah sia I on your profile
speaking of which
because back then uh
deliveroo APAC office was beside youtrips office

mm
oh okay okay I get it I get it
who ask you
then
mm
I don't know I I I've lost contact
subtle
mmhmm
because because I mean how I find out was I shared with her a lot of things she go and pao
there are things I didn't like about the the whole how they

hello can you hear me well
hello can you hear me clearly
hello I can hear you can you
hello is it better now
ah alright that's great alright okay so ya how you
you just finished exams
how is it
how how how's your results
unexpectedly good ya ya ya ya same ah
I'm so thankful for that
I mean like ya ya I mean our I would say assessments though like I didn't expect to get bad marks
so ya
mmhmm
assignments
mmhmm hmm
mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya ya like
ah
mmhmm mmhmm hmm
mmhmm true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like um all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to um the recordings lah because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching ah like ya as you said ah traditional traditional methods are the best ah
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like aiya I appreciate lah they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
mm mm and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all lah like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya lah I really appreciate that part ya
mmhmm I mean
okay it's really draining
err cause like the
ya then um like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days ah for forty eight hours ah so that was really crazy ah
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest lah because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
um
uh know
ya like
um hmm so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean uh I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like um it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given lah so it's really appropriate lah I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya mm
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time ah
um ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us lah err beforehand she was like um ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like huh really forty eight hours then she she she was like
ah later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like
okay now I understood why
but ya I mean
ah I mean like I think she she I mean I I scored well so ya I'm good
there there were like um five sections ah five questions five five questions
no sorry uh five questions ah
can you hear me well
can you hear me well can you hear me
really now
now
now how about now
no difference eh wait eh let me see
hello
it's still the same is it
serious ah
I'm like I'm using like the normal earpiece one
oh serious
really ah but then if I take out this earpiece then
okay can you
okay
serious eh uh huh
mmhmm
okay
wow okay and then

but then ya she mentioned ah like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
oh they usually ask us to tell the students that it's

the malay guy who I call
but but but have they already got ah their Q Q Q to check the the the line or not
mm
oh the ladder the loose ladder ah
see again
ah I think I think I just wanna wish you all the best
that one that one consider fair ah
oh
so after that you go grade yourself and then ah
and then when you grade when you grade for higher higher grading eh
this is what I heard from ah from harries ah he told me that if you grade yourself high ah then management will think that you have no room for improvement so ah management will actually move down to lower lower
chey

mmhmm
what do you mean by not progressing
actually um
so like I want to make use of it
even though um the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit ah cause like
I don't know eh
mm
cause like honestly nowadays
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
I saw
err
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
um
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is err embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do lah we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
ah necklaces or like earrings
oh ya ya ya
ya ya oh my god ya
mm
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to um
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that oh this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
eh average lah ya and then like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
mm mm so like I'm like
like what if like you on the
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
I don't understand
orh
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call uh sustainable is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
um I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
but like you know how um
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and um
cause that time um actually
my boyfriend actually ask uh ask me uh send me this post by Loop Garms
ah chris chris jericho ya chris jericho the shirt
then ah he like he like it ah cause he really like ah
like he was saying like he likes it ah then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
but but I mean like I guess
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that um as thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
people see it as an investment
I mean there's still a lot of fans it's just that maybe like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
so ya
ah
the whole oh okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more lah like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like um
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
um
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to um reduce um
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that uh I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
ya era era ya so
um I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
uh how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly uh
what we talking about
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like
I think maybe
for now you just try to
um I think that one once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price uh honestly
I I also don't I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
oh
okay but but I think mm
pricey lah in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
ah cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
uh
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever lah like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
ah by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
overseas
ya
oh ya ya ya
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
orh
should we order together
lah
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if uh if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
will you be interested then you see lah how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
shop I guess cause like
cannot come up with anything new
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know ah
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart lah and also and also
you post about it like once on her story
you know what I mean and that's still a lot what
anyway the designs also so cute seh
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love uh that some some
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly um
err
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know ah I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I don't understand why like I already have free time what I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
I'm actually still thinking about it
but ya so like I actually kind of
to me it's not really that complicated
you know accounting actually I think
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then um
because um
okay uh
okay so I I took when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well lah honestly but
but I still understand what it is lah
financial statement or whatever okay no ah
like
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
is not
it's not dreadful but then
it's honestly just very is desk job lah but you
ya
ya mm
um industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously lah cause
maybe
ah yes education and then
ah ya delivery like
ya lah just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
but arts will always be affected
ya
is it wild rice or is it singapore repertory theatre
they have ah I think they holding a performance I don't know
really
I got the email for it mm
I was like do I why did I subscribe to
mm
hotel orh it's a production
is it popular or what
boring
boring jer
like I can't make you a man or whatever what's that line ah
something you are not ah okay yes
I think it is because like because
yes
it instead of it being like a
oh I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like oh I'm just going to cast this
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely
certain race or whatever I don't know
ah ya ya ya ya
jameela
ah yes yes yes
tahani
yes
ya
ya
I know you trying to think of for a show where
I don't know ah like
yes because
but I have a feeling that some people
mm
mia khalifa
but
everyone in the world knows her and has obviously seen parts of her that I'll I feel like she would rather not
and she was also forced to do it also you know what I mean that's why I honestly sympathise with her on that lah
ya
it's not a lot lah actually but
I don't know ah
but
I mean ya lah
not all I will just say right now I just going to say right now even if I said all I don't mean all lah okay
but like not all but some
how do you think like that like how do you let yourself think like that cause I can look at a guy
and like I won't think like that you know what I mean
I I mean
I mean like I guess I get okay I understand
not trying to be like
fight back you know what I mean
like we are have always been perceived as
ah yes like weaker we like not the stronger um
species eh species gender sorry ya
like misogyny ya
okay
oh okay
mm yes
mm
ya
yes
arranged marriage
they don't have a lot of shows also
mm
ya

whoa
okay
I would ask for a a car
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so ya
so what about you akid
okay okay
you know what I mean
so ya
hmm
genie
genie the people who grant your wishes
genie
but I also think genie also have their own set of rules that you cannot ask for more wishes of these things what
you never know you know never know
the world is like super mysterious what
hmm
ah since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right
ah if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes what
so you get where I'm going from
for my love life I think
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls lah like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life akid
what is wrong with your love life
because like you know err
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
easy to say it's like it won't be good ah everything will just be everything oh I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate ah so like
so like you know ah sometimes right you need to think about
worth it ah
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life ah for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
ah
I mean everybody has their own opinion what
their own opinions in life
chey just joking but ya of course ah I want a pretty lady in my life and
uh show respect to my parents like that kind of girl ah
in that's what I look for in a girl ah
mm
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say lah like too playful ah
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she's a good mix in between ah like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall ah
but then turns out I'm not her type ah so if that that one I cannot do anything ah but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course ah every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus ah
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want ah I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
whoa
ah
process ah
process your morning
ah okay
a'ah
mm
it was just like out the blue ah
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything lah
it's like your first breakup ah you don't know how to handle lah
oh
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments what but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs what
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like oh this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated ah some would say
so ya
but then when she
labels ah I would say
mm
so you just became like a emotional guy ah
like you just needed like reasons ah like you want to solve it ah like you don't want to just breakup
like that ah
so like you try to you know talk to her lah but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you ah
she
move on ah so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky lah your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good ah because like
so like ya lah
a'ah seh
in this world ah
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
a'ah
oh okay okay okay
so what did you leave her for someone
mm
mm
mm
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
mm
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings ah
ya
ah
ah
oh that's good that's good
ah to be honest ah
it depends on how the break up went ah
it's like
ya
so like
what's the point kan ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't ah
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends ah
do you still searching for love or anything
ah
oh
ah
ah okay
mmhmm
mm
eh
mm
ah
you just try to care for her lah like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares ah
ah
that's
that's a super hard question ah because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended ah
like
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on lah
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this one
were you still moving on
ya
mm
your second girl your ex lah
ah
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that ah
it's like something that is lost can never be found again ah
people say this one
so like ya
ugh
ya
totally not wrong
mm
in my in my relationships ah my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me ah I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now ah like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course ah I I I feel like sometimes I
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn ah
so like ah
mm
it's like you just live ah like your future self think about that in the future ah I get what you mean
so like ya like you know ah
you always got to know ah sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship ah so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
ah go the way you want it to then
sorry man
life is doesn't work in your favour all the time
mm
ah
like you know it's like don't think too much ah pretty much don't put ah
oh I don't have money now what should I do
or should work and earn my money like that
you know like you never know you might just blink your eye and then you be thirty plus forty plus in the future

of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her ah
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
that guy ah then that eventually
um
living off from her wealth
was actually very very very
um
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama ah
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage ah because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
uh you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this uh phrase
ya
but
uh they got divorce but then
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
um
she like restrained herself
in this kind of thing again ah drama again
ya
mm
but then I heard that
I mean lah I don't know cause Syamsul Yusof has always been
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love what like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore kan
because I heard that he stole something and everything

ya
but
people private affairs seh
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
relationship I mean
ever since primary school secondary school and days
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex ah my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell um
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students seh but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that seh and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
so traditional
I don't know lah
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
huh it's not it it's not
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no lah sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then oh ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
don't know
oh my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay lah whatever you young but never mind ah
but she cannot handle the team well seh
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums seh
I remember so many people vomited ah
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what eh I remember she do the stupid like
err push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know ah
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
err the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
eh
uh I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop seh
and like I I feel it's not normal

help to
discipline us and make us stronger ah

oops
maybe I got it all mixed up
hais
ya maybe
all these shifts is making me tired
and I just want to be alone you know I don't even like to talk much
it's okay I think it's just a phase I would once I get used to it then
why
I shall begin it tomorrow my hair
still on
appointment
uh I see the steps
I know it's not really that disappointment as my previous hair treatment
but I don't know how long it will last
but but they do their creative colour all very nice seh
and they are malay I don't know why
and I think the other one is in the east
cause northpoint
right
mm
ah mentos jer lah
a'ah
oh
ya
fruit fruit
Fruit Plus
ya
ya
maybe we should stop eating candies
my god I feel like
eating Maggi
did mommy buy Maggi
pasta
you know that time the one you said nice
ya maybe I cook cause mum bought parmesan cheese
I like cooking now you know
oh ya
I don't even know why you like Encik Tan
huh
Encik Tan
oh my god
uh huh
just stare at it you
imagination's wild man
oh
but then you have to take the bus
like like the bus to go
to Dover
ah yes yes
but then if like that you go to school like how what's your route
oh
so two buses ah daily
wah
oh
orh
wells
I hope that
I get student card back seh
it's like you can spend fifty dollars
for transport in just one or two weeks eh
ya that's right
ya they always go by distance
owe a vehicle
the cheapest is about sixty thousand eh
crazy eh you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think
uh I don't even think they have the
it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all ah
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos kan
most of them the new ones are built near like
you got see uh is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something ah if you're rich
in like the richer side of Singapore
it's like whoa living the K drama life seh
mmhmm
how many
hi
hello are you are you are you awake
yeah
cause you don't talk to me in malay
uh ex-supervisor
then like at first like I always very tired after
work then I will I sit beside him then I just dozed off
like I dozed off like daze off
then he say
err
I don't know maybe he
maybe

I don't know ah cause he say
uh what kind of question is that when I asked if he can speak malay
then he also like

then he say cause he don't want to disturb me then he say then he actually message me personally seh
he asked me to sleep well
I just keep quiet
like cause I very tired
ya
ya I know right

no serious okay maybe I'm not as bad as some people
you know her kan ya you know her she tried cooking
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
because
kita sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like uh you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do lah I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab wah I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this um thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so err I was in what was it called squash oh my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is kan um
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab lah in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that wah dude it was like
it wah I felt like I was dying in the desert sia serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no lah cause actually the reason why I joined sports kan was cause uh it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then uh I found out that usually squash like in pairs kan
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like um you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes um the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall kan
then like uh then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like oh my god we can play squash together so I joined lah but then we ended up being in different groups
so
and now he's with an older lady
so
kan kan I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude ugh
oh my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because
you remember diana
he is I think he's four to five years older than us he is working at this um company so um usually he'll be at tuas checkpoint cause uh his company is collaborating with the checkpoint for this new facial scanner
thing
ya so but but her boyfriend is a bit her boyfriend is like you know ahmad remember ahmad
kan
on that very friday and it wasn't even that he started early tau he started at like eleven plus and then he was supposed to submit by err four o'clock or was it five o'clock and you know when he promised to meet her
no two o'clock
so she's she was waiting for him no wait he was supposed to meet her at twelve o'clock but then she was waiting for him from twelve until two
kan like okay
I respect everyone's beliefs
I have friends who are atheist I have friends who are non-believers I have friends who are buddhist my family has christians and taoist and all that like my family is a mash of like different religions
oh ya
okay so uh it was last week I think when I met her and then she she tried she and her boyfriend tried to set me up with her boyfriend's friend he's not handsome
I got I got
I'll show you later um I have way too many pictures in my phone
ya I'll I'll just send it to you tonight or something once I find it wah I need to delete a lot of pictures from my phone but but anyways
you know me uh but the the thing is kan so ya lah but I have a bit of a high standard when it comes to guys than their looks it's not just the personality you know and and the thing is do you know how he like so um I told diana and her boyfriend that uh I'm not interested in him like cause I once I saw the picture I was like
oh hell no bitch I'm sorry
so I said just give my tele cause I don't post my pictures or anything over there pe
so ya you know what was the first message he sent me
hey there golden child
kan so so I sent him this message lah like um my first and my first and last message to him I said hi um you can call me D uh ya err I don't even know why our friends like to set us up but I already told them that err we don't really we're I'm not really interested in you like as more than as friends lah so um you don't have to pay attention to them or anything and um
like
ya
I don't want to cause
so she's giving me until the end of the month to find a guy or else she's going to like do her best to set us up and I don't want that
ya when I find ya ya oh my god dude

like okay doing sports with my friends is okay but then doing sports with that guy and her boyfriend and and all his friends bruh I haven't even met your boyfriend and I'm not going to be match up with that guy
and ya I haven't replied to her oh my god what should I do what should I do what should I

but I can't hold that off forever
oh my god what should I do do you have any suggestion I need to find a guy I need I need someone to help me
oh should I just pretend to be a lesbian but no that's not believable
I tried that once actually people actually believed it
ya
but that's cause they don't really know me that well
actually you know um in poly kan back in poly I was asked out a couple of times by girls
ya apparently I give off a lesbian vibe
and then there was this girl who was
so into me she actually stalked me home serious serious I was so scared so everytime I want to go home my friends have to send me home cause she she would like take picture then she was like[eh oh my god we are in the train and and and I don't even know where she live at but I know it's nowhere near me
and you know what's the worst part
kan
and you know what's the weirdest part
eh hi we are on the same train again this morning like
bruh where did you even come from
ya I told her like oh um um I mean indirectly lah cause she was my quite close friends
ya
chi hao
but she never really got the hint
so until that project ah that project was when she got angry with me cause um I told her cause during the entire period she didn't do anything
ya
and then I was like oh okay we weren't even friends like she was in my course but she was from a different class
ya so I was like oh
okay girl I have seen but never talk to before and then oh my god there was another girl actually um so there's this there's this module called gen ed general education do you have it
and then kan we were roommates so like um okay this is going to get a bit explicit
mm
dude you know first day kan she just started stripping in front of me then she said oh I'm going to shower you can you can you can watch if you want
then I was like
so she met this uni guy over there and he look like her boyfriend
so she spend most of the time with him in his room
ya so um
ya at first
and then she said
end game
was he cute though
okay never mind
okay ah
oh my god I really want to see how he looks like
oh my gosh you know kan speaking of guys do you remember ateeb
he's still texting me now
ya okay
so the story of ateeb is a long one started back in sec one so in sec one um he confessed to me cause we were in the same clique
ateeb me jonathan zi qing and justin
there was this K-pop song that uses one four three means ya ya
ya so I wasn't interested in ateeb at all so err I told him like oh sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
he spam
zi qing cause at that time zi qing was my best friend
cause like
ya he was spamming everyone and then uh afterwards I okay don't tell anyone okay
but I actually
had a crush on justin
no no serious I and and I don't know lah was I so excited when whenever I text him lah
and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like zi qing
so um at that time I had a crush on a senior then the senior made fun of me then I um tala found out you know you remember tala
ya so tala uh tala heard about it then tala was like eh D how can you go and confess to someone else when you are dating ateeb
and then but but apparently a lot of people really believe that I was dating ateeb dude that was the reason why none of my crushes accepted me because they thought I was dating ateeb and I was like two-timing
he um he saw me with my one of my friend her name is phyllis then he said eh phyllis damn cute sia can you intro me to her then I was like um I don't mind lah but as long as she accepts you then then and only then will I intro you to her
so err I ask
him to give me a his best picture then
ya so he sent me a picture uh if I can find the picture I'll send it to you then I showed it to her I showed it to all my friends like asking like eh if anyone's interested in this guy he's super rich
he's he's super rich yeah that's the only good part about him
ya and then after that mm err phyllis was like everyone actually they said that oh he looks quite cute from afar until they zoomed into his picture and his face then they're like
oh actually on second thought maybe not it was harsh but it was true I mean like would you date ateeb
you know what happened he found her account on tinder like she wasn't using it at that time lah cause she was dating someone else but then um afterwards
she she saw him and was like eh I know this guy so she just cause like she remembered him as my friend so she just match with him ah
then he started spamming her asking her to date him begging her to date him then she was like no no no no and she keep on saying no then after that she she got annoyed lah so she blocked him on tinder you know what did he did
no he went to my friends list he found her account he added her he her and then she she thought that at that time um phyllis and I were in the same clique so she thought that I was the one who gave him her account
then because of that right she got angry with me wah he he ruined a lot of potential for me man then after that he he spam her her her ah begging her to date him and all that then she block him also then afterwards um we weren't friends anymore like phyllis and me cause of him lah
and then he and then we just stopped talking and then in year two he texted me again like um it was a snapchat then I was like you know snap streaks were like super popular right then so I was like okay ah never mind it's just for snap streaks only what so I was like streaking with him
then like what makes you think that any girl would want you you know he he confessed to huda also
ya but huda rejected him also
dude I know I'm desperate but I'm not that desperate as to like know accept your money and then like date you you are not even sugar daddy material man
he was the one who led himself on
so in
kan maritime is like one end
no I I saw because they have a uniform pe
so I saw the uniform from afar then I I I was so scared cause like for a few days kan I keep on seeing like students from his school all of a sudden keep on coming to my school so I thought it was him then then err everytime I want to go anyway my friends will accompany me
ya and then he was in america like the ship was going around pe then his last stop was at america so he had to get back to singapore himself
then at that time it was already like period like cause we end on february fourteen then it was already like
anyone ya anyone who came back
had to be quarantined pe so he was quarantined at a hotel
I already told you all my friends don't even like you you are not even their type no no matter how rich you are your personality and your looks aren't worth it bro
uh ya but I I didn't lah cause it was so funny to see what he was texting
he found my email
dude I don't even know how he found my email
that was years ago
ya
but that was what seven years ago
I thought I thought like seven years ago the emails would have been deleted already
so I just ignore then he emailed me like
he emailed me like on tuesday
I haven't open the email actually oh my gosh but ya
kan and then like um so I only told diana about this cause I never really get in touch with anyone else
I don't know man I mean oh my gosh I don't want to choose between ateeb or rudy that's so weird no no no no no oh my god I need a guy I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend but all my friends are busy
he's always been like that actually
ya but then during secondary school kan after I rejected him again he you remember crystal
ya so err what went on was that err ateeb ateeb confessed to her a lot of times then she always said yes yes yes but but everyone knew that she was only saying yes cause she was playing around with him
she didn't even like him
I had a crush on justin at that time also
then like couple kan
ya and then like with rayson I always talk anime with him oh my god I missed it and then at that at that time kan I really thought that I had a chance with justin tau then I found out he moved on from zi zi qing to zi ning
and then he was super into zi ning at that time then I was like oh so all this time you treated me like a girlfriend cause she wasn't there and ya so I'm just a rebound again

of course it's a chance of a lifetime kan
ah
ya lah eh but you got the shoe box what
mm
mm mm
wah
mm
ah too bad lah too bad ah
ya
good eh ah
uh cause I was
uh in university kan ah
ah ah ah ah I wasn't in london so you know
for my university uh it's already you know out of london so I just go up to manchester lah if I go to london I have to go down to london
to them one of I mean you all look the same you know you know all this uh uh ya
English people so I'll just borrow someone's uh membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something lah you know and my time don't forget because this is uh nineteen ninety eh
there's no man U wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know um
liverpool everton newcastle um all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian ah kan you know they track track kan
secondly thirdly kan
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
so that was uh always a lot of fun lah you know when I was also a student ah
then fast forward when you mention paris kan I actually uh live there two thousand four two thousand eight
not the duty free but the premium outlet
ah because that one is one stop
oh
euro Disney you see
ah
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet lah
ah dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
mm
mm mm
mm I live err I lived in err
err the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
err
quarter lah they call it ah so I'm literally halfway between champs elysees the arc of triomphe to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night kan
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part ah
oh so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite uh good
mm ah that's the gare du nord mm mm mm
the museum ah ah
ah
ah
ya lah mm the maghreb areas lah mm morocco algeria you know those kind of places
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
they they call it bateaux mouches the flyboat
ah ah
burn down ah
so you saw when it was still
oh

ah
ah sebab itu lah
wow you know it's really inspiring you see
ya
mm
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris ah look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
ah then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place lah you know so it's quite good to go
ah
mm
relax relax you know so quite fun lah
you know uh
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen ah I suspect will probably
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know lah
ah
paradigm paradigm mm
uh paradigm about two years about two years ah
mm
ya ya ah
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this lah pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks kan so
ah even for your maid you know today anyway lah eh these days
ah
but generally lah my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
that that's more it lah you know
err not not easy lah to go in kan that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
see the developments but the changes kan since my time there and it's been what you know uh more than twenty years kan almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
ah ah okay good we are one hour already
ah we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

then you pray
then
go market
then buy breakfast
then
now I meet you lor
you eh
well
I wish I was you lah
cause of my mum
everybody will put the fault at me how
no lah but hopefully next year can work already lor
I wish I was you man at least go Grab also
something what still got money what
nevermind lah at least you pay for something that is
for your life you know worth it what
like how eh normally wake up six sleep by ten
at home
wake up
bathe
clean house
go supermarket
not to say like a maid lah but
like it's something that a daughter has to do lah for their mum
okay lah but
okay lah at least I'm doing for her what
then after that
cause I look at my bank account also sometimes like I want to cry
but at the same time I look at my mum I also want to cry so I don't know what to think also so I just sit in the room
ya I just close my eyes ah and sleep back
nothing to do
ah so
at least you have three jobs then how how you want to rest
I don't know
you part time or full ah
you get to know your schedule already eh
start what time
mm
mmhmm
shopping
but what would you treat for yourself
my life
ya lah cause
if shopping
later buy all the clothes
after that
eat food is cheap
mm
ya even though it's phase two
huh
mm
honestly kan
you go airport lor
bedok you go pasir ris also
mm mm
mm mm
mm mm
cause only everybody can do anything ah which is wasted ah
and the thing is still not safe lah
but we still go out so we we don't care
maid huh
then secondly
if I go out also
we
you remember during the
phase one eh
you can't even eat outside so
if let's say if I want to have a alone time also if I go out
not safe lor so I just stay at home
if I lock myself in the room also
I don't know lah my house is never quiet lah
so I just listen to music if I listen to music I scared my mum call me
then she will shout at me lah cause I never listen to her
ya because I wear ear piece what
honest ya
I forgot the name but I know how it looks like
trustable
it's still a malay dish that a lot of girls can't do you know
be proud
appreciate food
I most also make
the hardest that I bake eh
that was the first and last okay it was nice ah
one day
cause you need it to sit like you need to leave it for at least
six hours or what
I don't know
for the
for the rice
then after that
you need to mix the
you need to put the ingredient properly the right amount
but
I don't know some people only take the green part they never eat the blue like duh
no you should eat both it's nice that way
personal training course lah then people will pay me but you know
when you're with a mother who's too
who is give in right
to me not nice lah ask to pay because I don't have cert what that's why I don't ask them to pay

bye

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

ya my leave lah then
err I've been trying to clear so
then like um
today we had some random meeting
about err strength training like err for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water um
like the whole company lah from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to shanghai and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams lah but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test lah before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
mm it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skewed err ya a bit skewed ah the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
err
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the shanghai branch and then ya we just shared lah then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes lah let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy lah the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like oh err there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown lah to tell them to tell us that the break room is err going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of um shut down on the zoom orh
eh not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay lah not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know lah when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
oh that sucks
mm do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure bo
sure bo
ah
huh
can like that meh
ya
then why you take
ah okay okay understand understand
ya seh
but ya uh
actually my last week was quite interesting ah
not interesting
but
err because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden err he joined the new shift lah
ya my three shift correct
so it like his first day was just me and him
oh no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do err
what was that err had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me eh just tomorrow
err tomorrow what's that ah oh tomorrow
I may not be able to oh no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was ah mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us eh on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge lah on that day
no it's not a big deal lah that job it's just
someone to be um
someone to be who's who will answer to the client lah
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like eh just I think err
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay lah why then he said oh because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad lah
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know lah I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt lah
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
err okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay lah I told him okay lah then go ahead lah you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day ah then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
um
wah damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not lah but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
um we are now separated into clients ya
oh cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know lah
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day lah because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like eh wait wait wait ah walao walao
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss lah I feel bad
um hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
err I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
eh no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day ah
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working lah
ya eh on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
oh you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve eh twelve thirty
then now it's like err three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
eh for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya lor so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
uh yes but then
um I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes uh
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult uh
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
mm
it's like
if I were to sleep in kan that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team lah at least they are
they are not big fans of
um
this client
this huh
yes but
you can always learn uh you know what I mean
and it's a job ah you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn ah you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people uh because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good lah I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on lah I've been too complacent
um
I don't know I I just I
what's the word ah complacent uh when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like whoa like you know about this like
like oh because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers lah
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it uh
like last month or what then I realised oh shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference ah
whether they
can work with you or not ah like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this um
this file
then like
um from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines lah like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines lah ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like oh I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it uh when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
mm
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
mm
wow
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever can pick up
people
mm
mmhmm
it's too loud
okay
okay
mm
ya lah
no but I just
kind of conversation
oh so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay lah I think it is their job lah
a'ah lah
weeb
weeb do you have that in the dictionary weeb
weeaboo
I don't think so please don't
maybe don't ya maybe don't
mmhmm
I don't know is it new
what is it about
mmhmm
okay
don't spoil don't spoil don't spoil for me
ya don't spoil
okay
two seasons
I think there was one there was a few ah kan was there one that you were looking forward to
right
released
mm okay
ya
don't think so
no lah actually I don't know how they transfer
of movies you know what I mean
to
no no like how they distribute movies overseas in this time you know like do they send the film over is there someone who comes
hilarious
films ah
projector lor
I think that's I think so
probably ah they probably don't live up to the name now probably it's expensive
I think I think projector is the closest we can find to that ah
artefacts like
mm
ya the effect lah but
that's the beauty of it
mm
the actual thing
ya ya
correct correct
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay
that's the maximum resolution ah
mm
four K two thousands
what you mean
mmhmm
mm
yup
mmhmm
mmhmm
of course
mm okay
yup
mm
it will look very like when you're trying to watch
landscape or is it the other way round

ya very stretched
ah like that
ya isn't it interesting
oh no
I think he's hungry are you hungry
okay speedy
ya
ya
what you mean clips

I think he wants the oo I think he wants the cut of it
you want the cut of the money
don't breathe on the thing
ya you were saying like movies
I don't know I want to do something ah sia I want to do something in movies
huh
I have but what are you going to film
ah
no I'm a I can be producer
okay
you sure you trust me
you trust me
ya but that's the I don't have eye like for
mm
mm
there's different types of
ya lah styles
but that's more like an auteur thing you know what's auteur right an auteur
E R ya something like that auteur yes so like they have their own style of so it's like
christopher nolan or whatever you know what I'm saying
Gong Cha
Gong Cha
okay
okay
mm
okay but okay can but filming is very um it's a very
flexible
project
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations ah
to get that shot you know what I'm saying
calm down
mm
ya lah
yes
yes
ya be a
be a realistic director and a writer
english
mix also can
what kind of themes would you want to input in like the movies that you make
mmhmm
to your brain ya
mmhmm
type of genre right
twist ya
age
understand
mm
what's a movie that you think
psychologically was it like
stimulating for you
mmhmm
okay
ya the one with the natalie portman
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
ya ya ya
but it's not very is it psychological though
it's very it's more nostalgia now
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
yup
ya
ya
mmhmm
yup
changed
and they played around with the splicing and all that
kind of put it upon themselves also what
mm
a'ah
ya
a'ah
mmhmm
and the
ya
okay what other movies
the wailing yes yes yes yes yes definitely
correct
ya
yes
a'ah seh
oh
correct ya right
mm it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like whoa I was so surprised eh
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are
ya sia
exactly
wah you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
a'ah
mm
ya
mm mm
ya
mm
you're also insignificant
correct correct
mm
uh then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
uh can watch online if you want eh you want to watch today
ya
why
mm
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that one will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know ah movies are
just tough stuff ah because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
mmhmm
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
wah
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this uh you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by blah blah blah
mm
mm
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see ah
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
ah okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
ah but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also what
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay lah not that bad
han orh
why
okay
okay
mm
mm understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
mm I try play on Borderland lor
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
mm
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things eh like ugh
things for speedy for my cat
um
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else ah
oh I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought um
to for the mugen train I bought the demon slayer masks
I I I I I only want one which is the
nezuko one
I ordered four
of course lah but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
mmhmm
ya
adli's watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
uh huh
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible uh that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also ah because like
thankfully
due to the
or haikyu maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
mm
a'ah
mm
ya so that's what I'm talking about ah
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
mm
so like
okay understand
mmhmm
okay
oh
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
um because I don't know ah it's different ah it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
err
she's very she's very quiet lah but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun uh
how about japanese content how are they like then she's oh she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
um
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
um
it's not as popular lah in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so oh I just do writing because she does err makeup
like uh she studies
err what's that called cosmetics I think
um I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore lah that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said oh she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it lah then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
um like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian one lah because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID ah
jakarta
ya lah
but she used to live in yoyga also yogyakarta
very nice ah they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different lah what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
ah I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
uh huh
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
um
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so um I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like um
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids what
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya koreaboo
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
wah I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online lah because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
um I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like wow and like it's hundred and four eh
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it um
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech eh
say it's for Logitech

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

for lunch
so expensive
the delivery
newton eh
okay lah the feels to eat satay is there
what time is my breakfast
okay
mmhmm
eh eh
wah
no lah okay first few times he asked me
I mean I don't want to say his name lah
but ya
then like after that people keep asking me
like we exchanged stories lah and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
oh no
until a certain while we all stopped giving and then he like go to another group of people to ask like
like
and like the cheese is there
ya
um mostly like indian malay food lah know the the normal kind
woodlands eh
like
make you put on put on weight faster
okay
mm
satay eh
mm
oh
mm
google maps says that there is a bus
high eh
mm
wah
I don't think I can make it lah if I wanna go venture into that kind of industry
mm
straight ahead
okay so
turn left here and then we got to take the overhead bridge
ah okay I can see already I can see the lights from here
ah
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
the night is still young seh
you know that I have oversized shirts right
wah grabhitch eh
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck what because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it what
mm
ah okay lah
mm mm
wah
mm mm
mm
mm
az
people say
don't cry over spilled milk tau
for my birthday but then we cannot go bali right so I want to eat indonesian food
mm
okay lah that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner lah if you want to plan for dinner
mm
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself lah in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
mm
no okay do you even okay maybe you do lah but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
mm
mm
I think we grew up differently lah
ah
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
uh wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
eh wonder woman seh
that's the villain lah for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan seh to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
mm mm
money makes the world go round eh
ya lah
but
mm
uh maybe we do something different lah you know that they have this like
you know those uh escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
world ah through the eyes
ya anyways those uh virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes ah
okay lah if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to um all the group who you know that uh not all our friends like to LAN right
mm mm
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
hais
eh
mm mm
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me wah
um
ya
so
huh that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
mmhmm
catching
mm
okay
so
ya
wah wah wah wah wah
ya lah because twenty dollars divide by six people
mm
too emotional sometimes
it's true
hmm
okay lah
I mean it's just like to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know lah tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
eh just message the group lah we have a group
ah
wait is it
I was looking at the furnitures lah to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website lah bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
huh spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty lah
but okay that doesn't matter ah
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know lah maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different lah
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
ah LUMOS aura projector
and then ah projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya lah
ah adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
mmhmm
uh huh
kan I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky uh
ah the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can uh I mean
divide lah the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
mm mm
alhamduls
mm all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans lah
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
hais
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya lah
kan the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what lah you don't want to watch like this
mm
so come come up with a new idea eh
munch nibble on something
it's cool
thick and juicy
a'ah
mm mm

have you decided what you want to watch
oh I don't have it I don't really watch netflix

oh ya cyprus is in the mediterranean it's next to the it's err turkey and greece in between
that's why greece is known for the santorini right so cyprus is something like that
does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
mm
ya so
it's a nice place I've read about it
the our master bedroom ya
mm what you want later I buy after this I buy
I you know I want I want the the err flashbacks right one says that time so ya you know you don't like to name you you maybe you will you not so impressed by the new version but I think it was good
like white mcwing eh no it's another mcwing is fresh mcflowers
chicken mccrispy ya um okay ya I can go north point later I will buy ya ya I can walk ah B I can walk there

so the you know that thing is called a segway right here where you don't need to walk you just drive so the owner apparently use err
use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him

orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly

my cousin who went to korea before he said that ah it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like
all the necessary staff for you to stay warm so I'm like ya it it's interesting ya for me but ya to your question it will be spring spring is my I think it'll be
tour guide in singapore I mean singapore got a lot of interesting and like places to go but if I were a tour guide I will bring them
it's very interesting question ah I'll bring them

oh ya okay maybe ya ya maybe if you want to
ah I remember you know the masjid sultan area what do you what what what area is that ah

err kampung glam
five stones they have five stone ah they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade ah where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of of like I mean ya I'm that I I give that kind of vibe to them lah like I I really like oh like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me ah
happy family you mean yes
oh I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of uh you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends um she suggested me this one at at that point of time of the year ah the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much lah like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like ah
they I mean they have a lot lah but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
oh I like
we watch the same thing ya ah kitchen nightmares
oh those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's ah go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like wah like wah you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
err how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say lah
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like ah
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
oh ya ya ya
movies
uh
oh movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one lah I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting what
eh it is so good I wish I wish uh I could you know get that that kind of uh if it was to exist in singapore lah or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you

ah
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be err read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean ah you know
ah food it's always about food ah in the end it's always ah it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too lah what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about ah
K got another question for you okay err

for you so ya ya ah okay what is the one thing that you wish was free

so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
err oh I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found uh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful uh peaceful what do you call ah called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like

like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
ah ya yes
hobbies actually wah hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me lah
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now lah I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like ah I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
I mean it depends on the person practising uh
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like ah
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff lah ya
of course yes
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
oh
I go with my sister I go with my sister uh to this to this to this concert um concert
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like

you can say like err laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
brown ah brown red call it lah orange uh this kind of colours that I'm more to
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no lah kidding love at first sight
um
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us lah but love at first sight
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like eh oh my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically uh ya very interesting how how what what do you think
oh I understand K K
oh my god okay
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got ah another question for you
uh oh you talk err oh okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
yes correct
I would oh wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our alamak this also very hard lah I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting ah country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that ah from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard lah to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of err
different type aiya basically it's culture lah but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
oh no uh huh
ya ya correct correct ya ya
oh no okay
oh
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore lah like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only what what for we will go like eh let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya ah what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
oh of course of course
any sound eh
when you see sunflower for me lah for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that ah rose rose is hard
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you ah much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
make us forget about the busy life in this ah singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from ah from that side that busy lah that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these lah I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

wah hazirah seh
ya it's been so long since I heard from you and ah ah I'm doing just fin
three years and graduate already no
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and oh it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope lah knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
s
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
mm why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard lah cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
for example um maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed lah but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
wah really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel which come with a pool can just chill watc
like around town are
hmm but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
go staycation just chill at the hotel jer and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
err my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a bali vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
um new restaurant near marina bay and this taufik batisah
and many more that time I went um
um cafe hopping with one of our old friend with hidayu if you can remember her we wanted to try the taufik batisah cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin

might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us jer

how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right I didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
I don't know how you do it like so low key I'm so curious like how you know what I mean I'm everything I need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
um but it's nice to know that you actually grown up and you know like wow the new hazirah take over the worl
but it's nice lah lik

ya
I don't I also don't think I have that much friends
I think it's only one once
one hand
ten people I think I have eight people in the attitude is just extra I have to invite because they're family you know
right now then I feel that
my brother oh my my first brother he's gonna get engaged

you know sign up for
driving classes already
you don't have to wait no normally there's a period between like
weeks to months ah you have to wait right

it's just simple steps you know but then they expect you to have like oh five years experience in you know
doing that type of job I'm like huh
hello
I don't see
what's the
I mean also
the pay isn't good then it's tough times what right now
oh teaching you got a teaching cert ah
oh
I did I did apply for teaching though then um
and then they say that oh uh you don't have a teaching cert from no I don't why do I need a teaching cert to be a tutor though
ya but like
why you need cert for that if you just gonna be a private tutor I don't I don't really see the need
need for that it's not really
it's not like you don't feel like
it's good workplace for you to stay if you like a bit toxic
oh ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
that's the whole point of training what
uh huh
wah
right
ya
just just toxic ah
the it's work from home
if you
why you don't prefer
okay lah technically I come from a background so
most of my job
prefer face to face lah so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that oh I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it lah
mm
you can say that uh I do
I do mostly the front end
it's called and design lah
so ya not not if you see
oh
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture kan
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people lah so
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call eh hi how um
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
look at the computer and then there's
do uh oh ya
we cannot complain much ah because
COVID mah
forever sia
ya
err but I feel like
ah I just want to
don't you feel like
you lacking the human interaction
uh
only now what I get to see you so
but it's limited to five
ah
paitao
ya like
I feel you I feel you
like
you come out from your room and then you see their faces you mean
round the clock you have to see their faces I feel you
ya
how many siblings you have
what why oh oh because she's longer in a
a longer relationship is it
oh
oh make okay lah make kind of makes sense because
she got stable job she's she's um
she don't have to
oh she's not
she's a
oh so right now she's also finding for job lah
oh okay lah there's some source of income lah
ya considered a luxury ah because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims what so we do have to you know
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then uh
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really ah that one I don't know sia
oh really ah
what how long already
you and your
oh
how how long have you guys been together
uh I don't think so
almost three years
mm
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
oh my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because err my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and err ya cause I
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there ah I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
um like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
uh huh
mm
ya lah I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
um you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded lah
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl ah then they expect a lot of you
female
get out ah
mm
mmhmm
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you uh get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
zao zao
mm
a'ah
mm
well okay lah actually
oh
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just um
just enough for his family ah I cannot really move into his place
so
no uh um
then what you feel what
oh
I think that's most likely you know
ya my
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
no lah it's not like I don't like it's just
and I got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though I I not sure how it's gonna turn out
hais
six people is too crowded already bro
I cannot
ya
I
but I really
how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats lah
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
huh ya lah basically jurong
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say jurong people are weird
I I have to admit ah because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
um okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
jurong shady ah jurong
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of uh there's not much of commercialised building it's more of uh
industrial building
so a lot of um
foreigners there lah
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
you will be scared lah because
uh all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation um
those um touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house kan
I take I walk from pioneer
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that uh people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know uh
they even take he even took the same lift as me
uh
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know lah
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight ah come ah fight ah
ya
ya ang mo kio
ya got industrial places what there
uh huh
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
tanjong pagar still not bad what
tanjong pagar still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot ah I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so jurong staying at jurong west is quite fitting for me lah you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in jurong west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay lah I mean it depends lah
jurong east also considered area but then
what's that area called ah you know hua yi there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the
but it's also not close to any
no noises lah you know if you prefer that
ya
oh
ya
used as back up right now lah because of COVID
ya I feel you man I also got some savings that I thought like you know
err rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible ah
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side ah cause east side I know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town what
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long ah
and it gets crowded
at my area boon lay there you know so
I don't do I don't do again I don't do well with crowds ah eh
what to do
I just can't
what's that called your
currently your plan is what
to
ya like cause you were saying that
you prefer to get married right now right
oh
mmhmm
ah
eight years is a really long time
so
hopefully he will change his we it will because you got say before that he is madam
focus on school
just spendings what
ya that's like totally different
don't we all girl don't we all
your boyfriend what race
your boyfriend what race
what race
a'ah
oh chinese
ah
ya
aww
how you guys met
how you guys met
ah online dating
ah for for me I feel like thirty five still quite young though
I I actually I
uh
with my current partner now
oh okay
your prime age
ya
but you have to think about the cost and everything
cause my
ya my my boyfriend is also uh
chinese but he's a italian chinese
he's more of the european side
so
I feel that there is a communication barrier between us lah but
uh

rapatkan sangat kecuali pasal waktu kerja
mm
mm
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of uh finding something else lah like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
ah consistency how you want to keep your consistent ah status
making sure that whatever you have done
ah you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like ah do something without knowing what you are doing correct ah
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon eh kevin
yes correct ah you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
huh
ah so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing lah correct tomorrow you follow me lah help me eleven to eleven thirty
that one we settle first then number two right ah
I will bring him to see victoria you know that same place victoria
so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me eh rasyidi you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost lah
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very ah
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you ah the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means ah
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away ah and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs lah
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement eh
the cement will be the second half of the unit what second half
it means it's not the for the front tau the front will be rental it would not go up huh
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
mm so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
ah a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that oh the sprinkler worse ah don't need do submission
her consultancy ah the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
ah to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct
ah
ah
and I think this this few days I will shoot invite to all the
they got cash flow problem
if there's an issue then they share with us it's good for us to know correct ah of course they can deny lah but of course you you know their problem
oh actually I will get my specialist to contact you okay fine
at least there's some progress tau
ah next week monday kan
and you can undergo a unit where a haggard ah then I'm going to my muscular that gotten my email and
if they want to do seventeen to be orientation then we let them do
no need to rush to rush ah we just tell them okay this is the powerpoint
this is the ah rooftop what key we going to draw out right right
ah so far so far ah so far I I have not seen them doing that
correct so safety aspect they may want us to provide them a a more secure ladder which I will get lye to quote lah
I I I think ah the new ladder doesn't matter lah correct justifiable correct
because they are our term so they need to access quarterly or as and when
nevermind boss you can smile until tomorrow boss but my appraisal boss
because eh side staff have their own issue so the of the side staff
rasyidi has done a good job for the past one year then he has okay supportive and then the tenancy like him

ah central manager to decide you know
okay

ya you ah never text me
um
how did you know
oh oops
sorry
so um
what do you want to know
uh
okay
whoa oi
hmm right
okay so
we went to walk around bugis
but
ya then um
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like eh can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking um we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the bija one then he was like
alamak we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
ah
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death lah but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
then
I'm not
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
eh are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
meh
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him ah but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
I will just say that um
friends
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff pe I feel like
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
hmm
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's period ah but eh
fast replies mm
so but
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
ego
you know
unless unless like what
then he will chase me and
no
mm
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when allah create men like this
okay philosophy
ya I do
how about you did you get some boy action
kind of
okay
oo
oh and oh no
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay got it
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
wait
is it also in the instagram account I follow him
the third one
ah
how many instagram account you have sia
oh my god
oh okay okay
is he white
men
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
um I got one
more news I mean
ya
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
um
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
huh
so
I don't think they will get send back ah cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games
um
oh you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
mm
ya just like um why question mark
no what the heck

what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like oh I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he
but I guess
he did say that but like I wasn't pushy or anything
what a pussy

and like I carry about three boxes every morning
up to the sink to cut the vegetables
my back hurts I cried bro I thought it would I wouldn't recover
I cried
ya I really I really cried
it wasn't
I only had like two days break and then like those two days break right the pain was still there
then after that I have to do it again
so it's just like building on then when I finally didn't go didn't put in my shifts cause school was starting kan then
the the pain went away I was like wait oh okay
so I cried for nothing
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
oh
later can
but my back not pain anymore
inshaallah
retail
but I don't think that is that
um
as painful as that cause
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like eh be careful that one sharp ah you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
um
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts lah but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread lah it's like
they will just keep it in the bread um
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread lah
but like for vegetable I can say that um cause I cut vegetables right
ah you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then um cause they say like sometimes cause uh not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh lah cause
we always get
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh lah not bad
uh it's a small restaurant thai to go but
eh that one right the pay masyaallah
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer uh maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that um
complicated
why
orh
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant ah but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's uh you know kembangan station
but I mean I can text her oh I can text her back and be like can I work
mm
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
um there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit ah
ya
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars lah sia
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money ah cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work sia
four hundred
mm
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
mm
that one the the um
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
I think ah I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause right
kind of hard
but
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
oh
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine and it but my father was outside ah cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always
if I work at night
so ya
then when I mop I on songs
so ya
that time I always did closing ah then my father always pick me up
ya
I'm the manager
ya
cause it's a small restaurant
then got everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but um different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float
it's actually not that hard
this sounds wrong this sounds like
stupid but I like to handle money
cash in eh
bro

ah subway manager
the ya
but I don't know where to work
if only they take in
youngsters
okay we are not really youngsters we're like
youth please
youth
I want to work in a library
no one will talk to you
no human interaction
shoot daggers
and but if you work
I know
twenty one
cause when you work in library you are under cisco
cisco is a police
and
I don't know I never check

ask for workers mm
you should apply

that's a long time
but you can only work one week then after that school starts again
on second week of october

I don't know they never say anything
honestly okay the thing is right started way before school started
but they are still unprepared
and I hated that
no brain
you already know this is happening but you still didn't prepare and then
always got last minute changes then the students also panic ah sia
the one that's doing the work is the student not you you just don't want the
telling us oh you need to do this that that but the one that is doing the work is us
mmhmm
mm
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
um
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or uh quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand
that that always happen to me
but I'm not smart actually
I'm not
I just know my shit

um so if you are an avenger what avenger will you be
and why
so
ya
is that your final answer
lock it in
um
I would want to be
um
I think I wanna be
iron man
it's boring but ya
because he's rich
and he has lots of gadgets
pretty cool
and he is cocky
but he's nice and cocky
I like him
ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
err
mmhmm
um got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly
um ya um but ah you mentioned you don't like avengers what actually you like you like
superhero superhero
oo why why why
mmhmm
I watch all spiderman
but like toby maguire he's just so sad
ya he's always sad like
he's always sad like it's so hard to find him happy only towards the ending that also I find it sad
it's just naturally
it's like awkward when I when I look at him smiling
err ya
sad
ya
err ya um
any recent movies that you are in
mulan
cartoon
damn I didn't watch that
um binge any binge netflix
I know right
I love it man mm
um recently I'm more like I watch toughest prison in the world
interesting
mmhmm hmm
it's very interesting um norway
has the most luxurious oh my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage um milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know um apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then err that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals um but err
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like um like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
um of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though um ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much ah
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying um
err the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can um ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like err norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same ah philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya
mmhmm
kan

mm
mmhmm

um actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
ah
um
ah they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
do the mechanics for ourselves ah to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged um someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her lah then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing ah if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn what
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya mm it's stainless steel
it's just too expensive for me I cannot ya
a'ah
mmhmm mmhmm

to use

err ya ya so he buys all those
whatever crap
he's a legit err ya I am not surprised
it exotic plants my friend exotics ya so he and then he sells ah at a higher price that's his business he earns so much more than my lashes like he can earn about seven hundred dollars per day when he has the the the one ah the plant that people wants
since it's real
I know right
which is a
a lot of resales from Carousell

mmhmm
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday lah ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with lah
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like uh if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment

uh money anymore
I
okay with

are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um

um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore

err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya uh um
mm
ya I also
err
go back into the normal state lah
and everybody starts to work normally and uh uh
ya
stick to the uh rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

two so according to ministry of health uh we cannot have face to face interaction with um
the patients lah the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya lah that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was um they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
ugh so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good um
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined um
uh how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
oh that's very soon
ah so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff um and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families um with their expenses
next year lah next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
um they bring in
ya
so
mm
mm mm
mm
okay okay okay now I understand
ah
mm
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
mm
mm ya okay
mm
ah
ah ya ya ya ya
oh okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
mm
newborn okay newborn cats jer lah
like for everything
mm
has a clinic
okay
mm mm
mm
so only only donations from from people from the public
wow
ah okay ya
mm
like uh
property development uh
mm
mm mm
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these uh animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
mm
where are the pythons
no I don't know
mm
ya ya
no it's your skin
uh the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art ah by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a um a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
huh
uh
ah
oh okay
mm
mm okay
mm
mm
oh
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
oh I didn't know that
oh
who puts up these these signs
oh say
mm
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore uh even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while um ya
it's just the regular birds the minahs the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
mm mm
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens kan not like before
hmm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to serangoon road
uh ya
okay
mm
sausage sausage
mm
I didn't know about that
is do they like
ah okay
how do they
serangoon
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
oh okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
mm
snakes of course
um we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
mm mm mm mm
okay that's new to me
mm mm
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves kan
ah
mm
mm
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
mm
ah
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something
huh

the snake ate the cat

better than nothing right

err you just come
mayor lah then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game ah
but if we're in town of salem this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that lah but you have to survive ah basically their task is to survive ya lah like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this err youtube

cause
okay lah true true true

but then I just I just hope you know the
uh huh err
yo but actually duh wah okay so you got anything you want to say before we end sir darwin
there are like thirty seconds left
ah hopefully ah inshaallah amin
okay lah but it's
and I mean it is has been like
it's been very natural right we do it as natural as we can right
it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just

okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better lah
like I know the outro was a bit okay lah
a bit better
because the outro previously was like meh
ya
now I think intro okay lah still what my second second video
so
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that one eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together uh then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade ah
saw online like two hundred fifty sia for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it ah sia
just buy ah
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade lah as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five eh the new Ryzen four gen four eh gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
wow
then what they release it as
the fuck sia
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him lah
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company lah I guess
but okay lah it all worked out for them
free money sia
ya
Sony is terrible sia you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck sia
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible eh
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first one that was like quite good sia
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course uh I mean I took awhile before I went to discord
whatever it is better than Razer comms man Razer comms was shit man
that fiasco I remember sia it ate up so much RAM everything lag
ya
not all
like
ya
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
eh for the life
ya like you know you go overseas you know and then like people pay then you take out the Razer card then you like eh my one got bro bro
ya
ya
ya
Razer is like so diverse is nonsensical
and then you have like the old models and then new models and then they all look kind of the same
it's like the worse sia it's like it's like err it's like err
ya it's just ya
ya
now then the people who don't know they buy the old one they got scam and then they like oo I thought this was the new one ah shit
then you like oh too bad you suck

but okay lah
I only just want the only that's it
with

uh COVID
COVID sucks balls
ya
ya
ya eh zero cases locally transmitted today I think and twelve
twelve day twelve twelve from ah overseas
zero ya
I think yesterday was two
yesterday was two
ya
at a very low number
they say what end of the year what
end of the year phase three blah blah blah
ya
can what now bangkok open what but then you have to stay there ninety days
oh same eh
oh really
why
oh
no wonder I was being seeing a lot of my friends in photos at australia so he went ah you can go
you can go ah
ya lah for travel ah
we are open to going but then
but then when they come when they come back they have to also lah
ya lah swab test is under no confirm got one all
ya lah
I think when you drop down ah
I know I'm not really sure lah I have to check
it's a lot lah fuck
payment lah fine
token sum
fuck
oh
because you like like considered like you increase the risk of COVID spreading is it in australia I mean australia got a lot of weird environmental laws lah
ya
australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week oh ya oh that means it really surged sia wah
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only sia
oh my god
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya lah
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like siao lah
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage eh only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck ah
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money ah then then but but that is unlikely ah
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like ah you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late ah can got late payment ah
but there's no interest lah
ya
you know the new borat movie coming out soon borat
and then there's this video of uh donald trump's lawyer rudy giuliani
so the thing is right he was ah asked to come to the bed ah the hotel room of the borat borat two got borat and his daughter I think
so the daughter of borat supposedly lah ask him to come to the room and shit lah
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever lah so then he put borat put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
ah so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room ah then he was in the room ah then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the borat came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen ah she was twenty four lah but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is oh he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet ah but a few people in the media industry watched it ah like I because borat does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week lah next week monday most likely the video goes public ah
ah no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad ah
borat does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer ah the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video sia come on guys
no ah they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
why
why sia
haiya they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
taiwan ah
the missile lah
taiwan ah
this is how countries do diplomacy lah
same like north korea what
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions lah it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over taiwan then it says taiwan wasn't theirs in the first place
the only sad part is actually taiwan defeated not defeated lah kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
because china is
ya ya taiwan isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of taiwan no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news ah
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between taiwan and singapore is that we are not under another country
ha ha ha ha ha ha
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean hey are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like eh eh boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
and then now cannot go back home
ah so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
then I was like uh
oh okay
why ah then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think sabah had err election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like oh that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread lah I guess
I don't know lah difficult lah the policies they have also not very strong so
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to lor
to like buy stuff buy fuel
a'ah sia
eh come on ah it's one third the price bro that means eh I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time ah jer per week sia that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only sia instead of times three ah two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time mah you travel there ah
every month eh
but okay lah takes a lot of time ah I personally don't do it because
jam ah
always jam
and then the closest one near tuas and then tuas you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
but okay what ah now got the discount what twenty percent sia for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is ah if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions lah okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight ah I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line
fuck you lah no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
ha ha ha
no expediting the process is donald trump man
very sad like he worked eight years sia for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like sial ah you all talk about emails ivanka also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know lah
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best sia to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really ah guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter eh bro
ya
now he still now he still
and first ladies ah
like melania trump nobody cares ah
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I uh I really don't care
who
valkrae
oh ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya alexandria ocasio-cortez ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch sia the most viewed stream I was like oh wow but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really sia she's really good sia and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan eh like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also ah bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say ah aggressive a lot of people don't like her
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like oh she's too progressive
oh err reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering lah begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week eh
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same ah it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything ah he's not gonna like oh let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
oh my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like ah the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct oh my god I was like ugh and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
world sia
never right
kan ah
any proof ah I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview ah like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things ah
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation lah the questions ah then after that he got
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes ah like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
kan
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible ah
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible ah that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
so how how's your job you know like ah do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like aww man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn ah like this moneylenders
like other crap lah that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same ah
but like this ah
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses lah
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government lah so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard lah
they are not going to closed down and the like oh no more public transport for singapore
ya but
ya sia
oh
period who go out not a lot sia
ya
work essential service not relays
but sad ah sad some of the really but lucky they got some subsidies and like you know

seven thousand
everybody wants to buy a bicycle now
I want a car
I don't care I still want a car
ya maybe whatever I just need a convenience of a car so used to having it at
ya that's true ah I think we will still keep the bike in the long run
ya but until you are old and grey

really
march oh ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart what it's not the same date what
I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
ira jer ah
that's not nice
I I don't want to put anymore ill thoughts on azmi
mm
he's going to what
oh I'm so afraid that he's gonna lose his job sia
he has his tendency of
where did you get this idea from
no don't be don't be bullshit that's not true my goal in life was never to be a housewife
alhamdulillah okay lah I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay lah there are girls ira dream is to be a housewife
ya but alhamdulillah ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so hey that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
no the example they give was repeating the same word like

I think we have a lot of things to talk about
I have a lot of things to talk about and I need you to be the one who reply so then the the conversation ya lah that's true just trying to pull your leg the conversation has to be a bit of malay also
ya
no but I want to be a balance of both I want them to actually think we are so good
whatever dude
at the same time we have a lot of overlapping so we have to get that not so much ah
means when I speak you want to speak when you speak I want to speak
ya which means I keep interrupting you lah
which is not supposed to be what it's supposed to be understand
yes they are confirm going

I'm in the middle of the conversation then you

there you actually waited that's just all I'm asking for you to do
I
ya
you know there's a red line which means you spoke too loud was it you or me ya
no because you went you won't see then it did it got shock
no just now when I read they say you if there's a red don't know what then it means your voice is a bit too loud
no lah obviously not void lah dude ya exactly I'll be so disappointed

okay I'm sorry
ya I know twenty
I know but
but that is not twenty
I'm a good student

no
for the first time in your life
so guys this is a stand up comedy and we are having our podcast and zaini is undergoing through torture that's so funny no please this is not a podcast
nobody would listen to this stupid lame podcast of these two this couple
also husband but you're doing a good job
eighteen ya that's true eighteen minutes I think we did a good job let's see how it goes I mean I think if you now what at forty two minutes obviously we have to complete the
it's okay
ya
of myself which is not reliable because I'm biased myself
ya that's true
of course not why would I do that that's just digging my own grave
we are doing this for money could you have some pity on us because this has been a lot of effort on our part
ya
no the crotchet to my phone
then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true ah and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
ah please the questions are quite fun okay um
I remember the question was mm if you had a superpower what would the superpower
what would you want as a superpower
I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower
no
what
no who say you can buy people uh oh my god the person who's gonna vet this conversation is totally gonna judge you for saying that
your superpower you want to be rich and that you want to buy your wife what the hell is wrong with you
your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last
huh one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared
grubby like very I don't know he has a malay vibes

ah alright okay so
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
ah it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so uh
set of tactics to use and gegenpress tiki-taka all all pre-default
okay but then
mm so there's more tactical freedom lah in that sense
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever lah so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then ah
four two three one
so there is no restrictions on that however
kan
uh
mm
mm
yes
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything kan this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
ah
so
mm
I have yet to check spanish league
belgian I think belgian league don't have then err
all those minor minor small small leagues lah
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game lah yesterday lah I mean
I tried a few clubs ah yesterday like err dortmund
then I switch over to uh chelsea then I switch over again to zagreb then switch over now I'm back at dortmund
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to lah
was four years orh
that's four years difference you know
siol
sixteen will be come out fifteen pe ah
uh
by right they should be launching in september october lah but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so err
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
ah so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first ah
at the end of day it's free pe if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one pe
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine ah
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot lah cause graphic is very very minimal
should be no issue ah
it's quite big ah
okay
I think should be no issue already lah cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
very very detailed
outliers
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
ah
so they add a psychological concept to the game tau
so then your core players kan the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything kan
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
ah
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game ah
no cause
okay you see eh it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest tau
ah
ah then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my dortmund case is
hummels was from bayern pe
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
ah you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
mm
mmhmm
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club lah
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new pe even though he's old
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat barcelona five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during barcelona eight two defeat to bayern munich
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team lah
mm
mmhmm
mm
no no no no no no
cause you already technically purchase for it already
mm
but then let's say you have uh twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam uh epic games account
you can you can try ah I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow lah cause
it's quite a big game lah but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me lah
ah seriously
oh K K K K
okay ah then those things do not need high internet speed everything
ah then I don't think that one can run lah
ah
internal cleaning tau
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed lah so dust is one thing
and then after that uh the make and model if it's outdated then
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst lah I mean
so it's very
it's quite intensive lah ah ha
eh eh
ya in a sense ah
oh okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again lah to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on kan so
in this version was the medical centre
ah so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot lah I haven't really jump into medical centre yet lah you can explore it later ah
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker eh whoa that would be damn good
oh you just press play play play play for ages siol
oh ya there is a singapore league inside ah ya
ah you
I mean this is a precedented situation pe
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle lah I mean ah like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
half your squad missing ah
ah
all the north ah
even the north south are not semi-pro tau
they are pro you know
fall from grace ah I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off ah their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with ah cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end lah cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
ah crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so you end up still going down pe
mm
it depends lah cause
unless you
liquidate the club ah
unless you dissolve the club ah
no
I buy over your club
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated kan cause of the financial fair play rules uh you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K pe just nice your club will stay afloat
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue ah
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down ah until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial ah
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
so they face financial difficulties they were in serie ah
okay serie A
ah
ha
third corruption
okay so what did club did was ah they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
ah to stay afloat lah so uh what juventus did was juventus pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
ah then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again ah
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing ah
but it is possible ah like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon ah that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this ah where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues lah I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this lah
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this ah err one particular example I know is dons ah
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then ah
english
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
I mean
look look at our situation
you used to lah still am lah so it's a difference
definitely ah I mean look at your size
ya lah it's cause
no lah maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile pe
ya lah so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change lah
I
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal kan before the pandemic situation ah then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
okay so imagine the players charging towards you eh running with the ball and everything
idea kan
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least tau
no lah I mean
at the end of the day
solid sia
I forgot which year that was lah err
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten ah around there lah
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so ah every other party kan
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight suria and the vasantham channel so uh every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels lee hsien loong face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him ah
it was a thirty minutes speech
ya I mean
no lah I mean okay you see eh for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation eh for our generation ah at the most ah
our first language is usually english
quite solid
okay it's
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
so obviously you only remember your first language pe cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
english ah cause
that's the language that we are used to
from but you said in ah
probably ah babe
I don't think it's depending on ah your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in lah
language that you use most often cause let's say kan
ah so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english ah okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language pe english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english pe
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
I mean at the end of day also
he will do one
okay but
I mean
eleven or eight eleven or eight ah screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down pe it's better than coming up kan the stairs kan okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
ah thank god
I can tell lah I mean
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a ah
a cycle to work to look forward to lah everyday lah but now is just
I mean
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside lah
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
haiya
it's a shame ah
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
whoa
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere kan
mm so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different pe everyday you have to use your vessel
mm
no ah
it's still quite low lah but it's not
that low also lah I mean
car oil and uh jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference ah
from how many litres to how many of litres ah so
no lah that one
it really depends on current situation ah I mean
as of now damn slow ah
to pick up ah
honestly this situation is worst when corona ah worst than SARS pe
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
ah so then the
this this lady was saying wah this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello ah seh they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing lah so I
think logically lah I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

yes
err I'm fine thank you
ya
um I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about um
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me um
ugh
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like err couple
ah redirected to me and then like I I I ask lah hi sir how may I help you
um and so err
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself lah to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude lah so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like um like we don't have a like um like we are like lower than them
correct ya so err
ya then the day before it was quite funny because um there was this err couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in hey but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then um ya so they were they came in and
err I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like hey why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like err she was like oh like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
mmhmm
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time ah they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards um crane operators err tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
mm mm
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
mmhmm
wah that is late
mm
my alarm lah oh my god
you know that's a typical um an err reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
mm
mm
mmhmm
correct
mm
aduh
mm mm
that is right
correct
mm
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
mm
mm
alhamdulillah
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share lah we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you lah as of now lah
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes lah like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like um I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it lah in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not um
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before lah like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like oh my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and um
um for me because um
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home lah which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of err
ya correct mm and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out lah
my mum know lah that he doesn't work lah
that's why she divorce him lah
you know
when I was in err primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long um
since I was in primary two ah I don't know eight years old um now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no lah she remarried and then um she divorced when I was in ya
mm
ya then like alhamdulillah like long time lah but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family lah and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said eh err I'm going to I'm going to the food court lah to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and um
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just err pray to god lah alhamdulillah my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know err one funny day err my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job lah I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so um ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that lah
was to like maybe set up a mm maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him lah even though because at one time lah they wanted to divorce then we we advise them lah like as the older children we advise them to stay together lah if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those err chinese people in society where they say oh I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
um on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
mm
ya so ya I mean I'm
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better lah or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
mm which one the the guy ah
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like um so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like err what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it lah until the time is up ah
book smart lah
mm
mm
correct
mm
mmhmm
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
mm
mm
mm
it is
mmhmm
ya it's so fast right your time like oh my god
mm
mm
mm
mm
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where um a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like oh I convert
of course
mm
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
mm
oh
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
ah of course knowing you you would have dressed up
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
ya is your acts right
mm
mm
correct
mm
that's great internship in singapore

to to to earn to earn money lah
most of them they further their studies
ah
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay ah just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree uh which
is related to my work lah so err maybe err err few years down the road err
down my career path lah in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
oh okay err I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up uh civil engineering ya ah
err
it it it
err
it's related lah but
uh not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the err engineering aspect ah it's more to the project management side
it was just like ah
ya
so ah
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now lah
even before during my poly I went for my err internship
so it was during my internship that that made me err think twice to to join the construction industry
err it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
ah
the working hours the nature of the work uh the work environment
err err ya
err
just sharing my my my experiences lah
okay okay mm
ya they attach me to a local construction company
err so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries lah or you can see a big difference between a local company and err err foreign or multinational company lah
I err in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that lah so I was attached to a local construction company lah
ah the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a ah
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
acknowledge
in their office ya that was that was how I felt lah
it's a it's a foreigner I think ah he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
ah
so ah
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
ah
abeh ah
the project manager err then the project manager
on that day on that day ah
uh I think every every everywhere you work lah every month they will have a progress meeting ah
so the
so
ah okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
err the size
this ah project lah
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days ah
who who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay lah and then
he literally
ya ya I am ah
ya err
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
ah so ya
the only
err the higher up
once a month ah just for the meeting ah just for the progress meeting mm
ah ya ya
so ya then err that that was it lah
it's like maybe err five five workers five staff or five to six ah mm
he's from uh
ya
ah ah ah
so ah and ah this ah
organisation he he he is a student from this err organisation ah
err
err the the students from china during the err
try try to
err like err
mm
uh
what um what's the
ah ya ya ya ah
err err like
ah language barrier and
err in in his own world lah
err err
ah ya office hours ah
stay back at work sia
then
only then you understand
what he meant ah which is true ah which is true ah ah ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
err
err wasted kan
err in this industry just just to just to have a job ah just to have a job and just help out help out the
uh pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did lah then
err
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind lah
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages ah it's not it's it's no longer
err that time was like what
early twenties lah kan early twenties
then you literally work your way up ah
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind lah
ya so
err
ah like
and it also ah
you need to have some technical knowledge lah which I was lacking ah
err with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking ah
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad ah
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas lah
so
ah
oh okay
mm ya ya
so ya err
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
ah consultants usually they provide the technical err aspect ah
so err when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
ah when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it lah
ah
a a
a degree lah then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
err previously was unisim now they call it ah
ya so
then you decided not to
okay ah
good for you lah good for you I mean
ah ya so
I took up
err my part-time degree
oh everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you ah
mm mm
ya
in the industry because your industry uh
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
uh with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like ah so like
uh we are a big
and then they got their directors lah and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy ah
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally ah living a comfortable life ah
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under production ah
under it's under ah
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure lah
like you are running out of time ah so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
ah there's this
err
it's called a ah
and then the new zealand err working holiday is is a visa lah basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
err the visa is for six months
err
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
uh is that horticulture industry lah
reservist dah approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen eh like
only god knows what I was feeling ah at that time like
oh singapore at at first
ah ah at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
so like
for the first two months like that one
ah april ah
yes yes uh huh
at that time when when the the the
the news was was at at its height eh like
got diagnosed positive COVID positive ah and she was seated like ah three
three or four tables behind me which is
you have a lot of things planned already eh any like for everything to come crashing down eh it's really disappointing ah ah but
err at that time we just ah
ya but then err then
after that things happen

mm
mm normal
crazy as always
err
ah of course
what's new
just can't wait for my colleague to come back
then I can
back to her
too much
sue me or anything
it's true just stop then
like I just have to shut down and then restart
but yup and then
okay lah but I I manage
to like like go for good dinners um
on wednesday and yesterday so wednesday I went to Poulet
ah

Poulet and then um
ya err because they just got halal right
so ya Poulet just got halal
like I think a week ago

I got like
ya and then um
and so wednesday I went Poulet and then thursday I went to
okay lah I mean I'm one of them lah but
it's true right
ya
I don't know I like the place because of that that water fountain thing
ya I just
ya and then I love the the the the atrium because
I can just blend and sway with them you know
just keep swaying just keep swaying
but it's closed now because of that christmas they have that christmas
display or something like you have to spend
thirty dollars to
yes
yup
so I did spend thirty dollars just so that I could enter the atrium
and then end up not going to the atrium
it was on my A&W and err I I got a drink after that or
ya
like basically you just need to spend thirty dollars and then err they will allow two people to enter
ya
so that that was my week lah
I mean those are the highlights of my week
oh

with my work with my work music you know
ya and then um ya lah err yup yup yup
it's just that ya I was a little scared that
I went over my weekly limits of going out

until what time that kind of thing which is surprising but
ya

okay lah maybe not weird questions but like
you can give like out of this world kind of answer
okay
like
if you get to
be on a rocket
and we are out of earth
kan
hais
but why would you want to do that
mm
okay but mm
so back to my question it's like if you ya if it can be in a rocket and then you're out of the earth
where would you want to land that rocket

mm I think I want to go to neptune

Instagram
yes because they
they will share all the beautiful pictures of the planets in the milky way and the black hole
calming colours for me alhamdulillah
ya it was and then
then mm
I don't I've okay I've never read into what neptune is made of so of the I mean they're all made of gas but
I'm not sure of the
composition of it

ya and then maybe I can just be there and just be square because neptune's circle
square this this is
no no don't
yes okay ya
okay now your turn answers stupid random I don't know funny ya just just out of this world kind of question ya you you just have to be
we'll just have to be creative something
don't roll your eyes on me
mm
I thought we did this before no
I don't know
a giraffe yes
always
but no ya I always find they are
or at least my encounter with them the first time was that the giraffes were very cheeky
and I thought that represented me a lot
cause ya I'm quite cheeky and then
ya they're just magnificent animal
and I think
I don't know they they kind of stand out
ya
I know you properly ya
ya ya ya ya
it's just over there

having anything or everything
what would you be
means like no restrictions at all I can eat anything can be anything in this world what would you want to be
you can be anything is this world what would you want to be
I want to break free
why would you want to be a non-living thing of all things I think even non-living things want to be a living thing
it's a privilege
they don't get a choice
they don't get a choice it's like something else is
doing he choice for them ya they can be anything and a lot of things but
they never ever get to choose
be something useful
apple tree providing apples to the world
no but seriously what what would you wanna be you don't know

if I can just
ya okay that will be one thing but like also in terms of helping people

I think normal platter like say chicken chop ah only four fifty or what
with two sides

um cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside

ya ya ya
oh okay I think I know I know but I never eat never tried it
oh
ya correct
ha play ah more you can play more pub games ah I feel bots like no point ah
because all the toxic uh opponents or teammates right
it's because your team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious ah especially the filipinos and the pinoys in DOTA wah
damn toxic man they like I don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also ah
oh genshin is just my browser not loading ah I think if maybe got to do with my internet connection at that point in time
but I yet to try again ah
the main part of the whole thing ah
mm
but like
ah
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
uh huh
okay
uh huh
ah
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
oh I see I see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
mm
ya right right right
the best so far
one of ah
ah better than runescape
ah
ya confirm laze ah after a while
ya ya
maybe lah perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot sia this game it's like available on all platform except like console lah
you can whale on genshin also
uh huh
huh wah this crazy ah
wah
so you think this one more
you know money intensive or maple
ah
do you even spent money on games
orh okay ya okay makes sense
orh
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
oh
ya ya ya
oh why eh
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
bayern very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth ah
hmm ya each to its own ah
ha when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
fuh
when's the last time when's the last time you went
ah
oh so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
can ah try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent ah and like
they really build up their name eh you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by uh Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there ah pretty nice lah you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same ah throughout all these brands I would say
ah
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
mm
ya
eh but this one is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do lah but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these uh
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding eh I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
uh let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than eh APOL is three nine eight
ya
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
uh that one obvious sia the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like um forceful kind of you know
what they call it ah damage on your behalf then it would be voided ah
I
over time maybe yes ah
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
uh huh
ya kinda it is it is
ya
that's true ah Coke like damn sweet eh I I'm not a fan of Coke ah it's too sweet for me
ah
ya standard correct
ah
oh carton
ah
ya ya syrup kind of base drink ah
that's non-fizzy
mm Seasons the blue colour one right
that's the green tea ice lemon tea eh is it
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
eh wait seasons
oh I think I got I think I never try Seasons uh peach tea before eh
oh no I don't think so eh the I can't recall
maybe ah
mm
uh
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
because you got the mindset lah like you know there's a
relax corner in school
ya
ya true true
uh
I also finding ah I want find like uh you know like stable kind of part-time
and nine dollars ah if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of um eatery
never banquet I never do before that time was uh kitchen job ah
ya Grand Hyatt ah
so you know when banquet uh how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already ah that's why
orh
Shangri-La
uh huh
gary gary kan you know gary then the alex those people
events
ah ya ya ya they are events uh lighting all this kind of stuff
oh
orh
uh huh
a'ah
oh
ya ya
so it's a win win
it's a win win situation lah
ya
true
because
eh since when you care sia bro
okay lah okay lah uh you changed man right
no the swedish bistro uh they call it
ya
uh huh
I'm not sure ah if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
mm
err but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called ah
Malayan Council eh
huh serious
I never tried that food before ah but the desserts not bad ah quite delicious
uh ya my sis told me also because the boss kan like it's uh this chinese guy
he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right ah
ah
ya that's why that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
uh the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and uh tea or something like that
good good the
actually I don't know also I never see the store in person before
ya around there ah arab street haji lane
damn long ah I never go this kind of place
eh next time
eh of course ah I broke man need to find work
go there then step give the akshay face ah
no beef lah then like just laze ah
hey beef is on bro
wah I need to watch the thing
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video
to their series then I'm like huh
can't be like just a random fellow can managed to get a skater
a proper renowned skater you know to come in
uh huh
ya exactly
uh
ya it can never get old ah
which one
uh I don't know I haven't been like keeping up to date ah with their videos

you and him met first then I was still on the way there
ya
eh I injured man right
or how who else sundair but achap cannot what
I thought you say he's out for the month
talk on Discord eh don't say like that
have a day outing
that
hashtag
mm later he got hashtag dare to stab
eh
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish uh cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
huh
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like uh it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
ah ya something like that
but it's quite dope ah
ya
five I don't know ah I never see since the pre-order part
I think no ah like they still publish ah it's just that it's out of stock on the main uh website if I'm not mistaken
ah but you don't actually own you didn't own one right

okay ah was short-lived also ah
it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing err like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that ah Vita
ah Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
I think
mm I think the main appeal is just because can support the
uh what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new what this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame lah to me

ya ya why

ya that's my job lor then I like
err work err from monday to friday lah ya
then how about you
oo
ya tell me figures ah so that I know that my job this err
okay lah per hour babe
mmhmm
walao I eight dollar fifty only eh then got some more
he came to me ah then he he ask me err err wait
what do I do what do I do if I miss my number then I say
I already put your basket already why you sit down later you will be served then he say
no no no is my english very bad that you don't understand why is the
counter fourteen is empty why is nobody there is it
alamak then you know my my senior was like
keep silent then I keep quiet I keep quiet because she's my senior mah so I keep quiet lah okay I keep quiet
then after that he say hello why nobody answering my question then me and my
me and my friend was like err then we just went back to the our back uh
ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what kan so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him lah
ah actually confront him because I was almost on my like
like you know then I'm like ah ya lah that's what happened ah that's one of it ah
mm
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more uh actually oh my god
will think that oh I wait for mm
hello ah um sorry I wait for one hour um
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya lah which is which is expected lah but that's like one of the few incidents lah it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of err older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
kid ah then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground lah ya so you know
singaporeans like very kiasu and very like you know
ha they wah new iphone new iphone ah they can what
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill lah all okay lah okay lah
ya lah ya lah ya
smooth ah smooth ah gucci ah gucci
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
me my course my course is mm media production and design kan
if I'm wrong lah so
mm like designer
like magazine magazine you know lah whatever lah ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it lah like
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like uh err gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at so it is related to my course
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
what works what works ya I but I
okay lah I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside err like a hospital kan nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info lah words so having a lot of bigger fonts
extravagant you know seh I think so so I feel like if I were to be
at somewhere that is more
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
damn sad ah ha we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
err they they're all lah whatever uh whatever um like you say food business you you study
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder lah basically ya so right now
ya lah like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do lah I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
err to be so fixated with
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
ya lah kan so so I I
oh my god yes oh my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or uh like
oh
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally lah ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing lah like you know like entertainment wise
oh ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
mm
mm
how how how
oh
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
but now is more now since last time I'm ambivert kan but now is more introverted
mm
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining ah but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
can relate lah like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them lah like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
I think it affects us ah like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya lah
mm I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since uh we talk about this COVID nineteen thing eh I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like err
there's a lot of like bombings also um in gaza and everything so it just makes makes how to say ah it's more we get
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more err faster I don't know
basically be more open to such issues instead of oh being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise oh actually
wow we are like ya sia we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no seh I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters ah
yes correct
older generation ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ya
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad ah like you know cause like
err I like I have faith lah
for like this
will be a better country for the people lah not just for economic
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
flaws ah
that we ya but ya lah I just hope that things change lah
ya so right now what's important right now is I'm hungry
like just now I eat what did I eat just now let me think
err what did I eat ah oh I eat fatty bom bom
but is a new the new outlet at uh east
at my bedok that bedok heartbeat it open a
it was meh but
maybe because I didn't choose the nice one
thing lah some like wah quite heng lah then I'm like
chill ah I'll just eat ah I'm
but their mashed potato nice sia I like seh
it's western everything is western lah with pasta and rice and everything
oh my god

ya we have to eat you know so I don't know
speaking of it eh what you eat just now ah
what what oh porridge nice meh
you like you like porridge ah
oh okay
not bad ah
wow
now I feel like cause I've been wanting to eat breakfast Mac McBreakfast sia
ya we don't I don't
ya but I wake up
there's there's a ten minutes break
it's not a shift ah it's err like
ya it's uh eight to five it's not a shift
there's one hour break lah
but like but like I have a ten minutes before if I
if we bring bread or what you can eat at that point of time or buy something
but the thing is I want to buy but I've to wake up early and you know me
mcgriddle
ya but I've been wanting to buy it just now but then I was
like shit it's too early and then I was like shit but I I miss I
like other timing kan like it's not always like a constant err
fixed menu right why ah why they do that ah what
oh oh ah I like heavy because if I eat light I will shit
and then okay basically ah I don't know maybe got something wrong with me ah
but the thing is if I eat something heavy or what it will be okay I don't know what's wrong with me but like
I think they have the plain one the plain one is my
okay so
uh huh now I hungry sia shit
okay so
what time did we came here ah
eight
no like in this
contraption
okay okay so I'm eighteen
ya we met in poly
cause mm
interest group ah
ya
okay ah okay ah okay
okay it's okay don't worry don't worry okay
where do we where do I start
okay so okay I
springfield secondary
ya so I
oh you didn't know oh okay
ya so I started with sports okay but I bored of it anyway ya floorball then ah ya
four years ah
yes correct from sec one
C division I think we got second then B division we got second
I I I became the captain I think
ya it was like shocking because
okay
I'm like quite a perfectionist
so last time uh I'm not good at floorball but there were like
so I thought that maybe this is the chance to learn a new sport
so you know what I did
okay basically I didn't have the stick and everything I didn't have the funds
then ya I I I
it's the not the wooden one it's the screw-able
that one ya I took it out then I use hanger the steel hanger
to form the shape of the blade
ya then after that I wrap it in wrap the blade
in in tape
as thick as possible then I attach it to the ya to the
I I practise at home I did once bring it at school but uh
ah but if I don't remember but I showed them okay maybe not maybe not
at all because it's circle it's very thick and everything
like it was swollen
ya
ya because it's the training stick ah the not so good one but training stick
ah I bought lah using but that's when they they told me you can buy using ah what is it called ah last time
medisave eh medisave no medisave edusave medisave edusave edusave aiyo ah
education whatever thing lah then like
ya lah then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that uh because I
everytime I try to shoot kan the ball will always roll on the floor
it's there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings ah unless the stupid teacher wants ah
but that's err that's another story lah but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades lor but
it's okay lah I got to be the captain lah so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
so okay for me I find I'm ugly ah
I'm ugly back then ah honestly ah among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position lah
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me ah that's how the the team bond ah
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also ah I'm sure your one also dramatic right
oh
oh okay
you you involved
oh
I'm okay with you
oh
okay I'm quite
quite surprising seh to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
mm
that's good lah because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
there's a lot of rumours about very petty lah just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away lah from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well lah because we're the most bonded
team ah because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like leh we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals ah
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do then after that oh I oh design don't need math
uh my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one ah
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now ah that's how I got into ford lor
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
uh I heard a lot about like drama
uh huh floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
err I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
in smart asia lah
cause ah my friend also lah cause her friend is in
is the vice president but eh president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or something like that lah so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it lah basically
how to say ah I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden ah for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined eh few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like wah another commitment
but it was already after um
oh haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's um I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion ah but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me lah but that's the thing lah I can't focus on one thing lah
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad ah honestly
but national wise um don't know yet lah but I think not bad lah
not bad I think not bad ah honestly not bad ah
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other lah
so ya lah I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you lah that's how I met you lah
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
like
it's not weird lah it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most chillest
kind of kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much ah I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right
ya
I thought I thought you I don't know eh I was kind of scared of you lah
I feel like you like a
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look lah but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley lah so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also
talk talk to other people so it's okay but then actually
didn't expect then
ya lah actually quite fun ah actually
smart asia was the most randomest
thing ever
quite a lot right
kan in fact
flower actually everything actually almost all
err you did the flowers for the mother's day
for the whose idea was the ignite one
there it's more than one idea we just added added added added added right
ya we we that's that's the best idea sia I don't know why sia
I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like wah damn sad eh
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it ah
they just want to have a so like
oh there's actually point incentives to do let's join this one instead and get
point system or something like that
so ya lah I think it was fun lah
but it was like really the really feels like a like a amongst us kind of
like we're the cause we're a part of the EXCO mah then we're just like
let's okay let guys um we plan plan plan plan guys what do you think great great
it's just us deciding among each other you know that kind of thing ya
ya then I don't know
if you would rate your okay nevermind let me think properly
which is the best
experience of
tertiary education
no no no not okay education which stage
is the most ah ya ya ya which stage is the most exciting to you
mm meh
okay lah
happiest unproblematic yes
okay okay okay yes yes yes
okay
oh okay
yes oh my god
mmhmm
okay
okay
oh there's such thing ah okay I didn't know leh
oo
I was quite popular in various gorgeous for being like the top housekeeper like I don't know why but like our sports the there is like even and rope skipping sector where it
wow got vision this is a sport
mm
oh my god you so pro seh
while skipping
wow pro seh
mm
wow
uh huh uh huh uh huh
ya that's why mm
okay
wow
but
it's with music ah usually the competition
oh my gosh
ya
oo
oh
wait so so
oh okay
ya ya ya ya ya
uh huh
seh lah oh
oo okay
is it not your passion also
for fun lah mm
I I also only started dancing
ya but not good
I like free styling but I don't know they keep
every I know can do K-pop ah you know
I free style a lot but but at first I look stupid lah
ya I don't know why I found myself good at it later I show you lah the video
but don't judge don't judge me ah I I no training but like
ya so now so meaning
ya ya
okay
oh
it's like but fast and sync
ah you like the kind lah
ah
okay
mm
mm
it's so
oh
oh not bad ah
okay okay
if win win lah you lose ya
forte kind of thing
okay
oh okay
mm
oh so there's
oh shit
aiyo
mm okay
not supportive ah
oh
oh okay
oh okay
but you got you work a lot of you work ah ya lah
oh
mm mm
aiya
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
mm
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary
not really
mm
you did ah
my eh my also same
eh I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know lah a lot of stuff lah they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing ah so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director um
I'm the creative director of
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big um
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit lah basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also what technically
I have but it's only for personal videos ah
not not like a thing thing kan but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay lah should can lah basically but anyway I'm just saying like
wow I didn't know that you had that err roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
oh that's how you get got into culinary I I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya what what would you do if it's not
actually you can seh I don't know I think you can eh no but you can eh
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but mm
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
okay I want to work as a
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think ah poly student will adapt better than a student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
oh sorry ah you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a cert so sorry ah sorry
then the other person will be like oh uh you're accepted then I'll be like huh why I wasn't accepted
oh the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like oh and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair ah
quite unfair ah
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no lah no lah I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
uh like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
uh if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true eh it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know ah but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair lah if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans lah to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
a bit more
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
uh just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing oh it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
oh the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
kan you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything ah basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature what

okay
ya I'll open the prompts
okay
then to start with the first question
granted
okay I also wait you think for like one second
okay
uh hmm

what the hell
no no no that is very unhealthy that is a unhealthy weight to lose weight no but anyways
then you will rebound back ya so now I think you are damn traumatised too oh my god that was so bad but then like you didn't know
like light snacks

it means maybe he is worried about your health then like for you to get both why you want motor though like I planning to take car like next year why motor
mm like your brother mm wait are you an only child wow
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking ah cause you know they always jio us at
they throw malays everywhere but the army
of course lah but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things lah you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course ah but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute ah you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we err the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect orh
ya like I don't understand err
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya mm
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor wow
that's first hand right I think my friend bought second hand one
wow like that's a lot of money sia
oh
I haven't even think about marriage eh I wish I was that far ahead

all these can make money
ya and then after that you just drive in your golf
like you know the go cart is it called go cart
buggy
ya buggy do you know it's called buggy K ya
ya so ya it's so nice like can you imagine like the size of it
no the the land
then like
ya exactly so like
you cannot have what you want to have inside your imagination
so
like if you think about like
golf club
wow
who say I want to buy in singapore
ya ya I don't know
maybe you wanna go like
because like like singapore is like so home and dearly
and then like if you were to like have a house maybe it can just be like a staycation house is staycation is it called staycation
vacation house
but then
ya
uh huh
uh huh
then
oh ya ya ya
very modern
because it's like made out of wood like it's very rare like you know like only like places in indonesia have
I think pulau ubin is a concrete
ya maybe
right what the wood
eh best pe
that'll be so fun
ya you come in to the house you wear slipper
ya so eh you eh what kind of house you wanna actually have
okay okay you realistic
mmhmm landed
it's okay
they say can dream ya
ya
ya I understand
true
I don't know leh because now the houses in singapore that's more like like anti overalls like very small so like
mm
ya true
whoa nice nice
jumbo you should try jumbo
ya
but I think it's like executive right I think it's still okay
mm
ya which area you planning like okay if you were to stay in singapore which part of singapore do you think is the best part to best place to stay at
jurong is west
east ya
you never see the map
okay
uh
okay let's say north ah you put north we put north as woodlands we put east as changi
okay if you go woodlands you can go
if you at pasir ris you can go changi
I can go
take the
ya no no must go first
so with that gave me a letter
so okay so where where will
more towards the east
mm
north east nearer
mm
mmhmm
really
for real
towards the end part ah
ya ya ya allah

because
ya I say like for dream house right dream house would be like
central lah right but central house is
hmm
no
central is like
central is like uh paya lebar
uh you know ya like mattar oh no I think mattar is also quite inconvenient macpherson

ya
the thomson line coming out also will connect the dots like more dots to connect
your your place still no dot
right
haiya like I thinking also lah if I were to buy a house right like I want to factor in so many things
like I need to factor in like the money
right like
okay how much right do you think you will plan to spend
like uh for a okay let's say you wanna buy a maisonette
oh no wait you wanna buy a maisonette right
it's like a
ah
ya it's
ya
okay so okay so you wanna stay at the north area
and you wanna stay at err
err
house
okay how much are you gonna willing to pay
are you serious
oh my god do you plan
you want to sell your house

mm
mm
so your house is how many rooms flat now
four room flat and it's going at five hundred ugh half a mil
mm
mm
mm
it will take so long

a lot of things actually no eh I think your area not a lot of things
oh
it's a precious house
we were talking about like if you were to if how much are you willing to pay
for a house
ya definitely if you find a house executive house that is below half a million kan
okay so
no
wow
eh
mm
wah

okay if let's say right okay like my house area now also cost about half a mil
put six hundred for
super expensive
but then like if you are buying the three room but then like it's small like I mean like last time four and last time
like four room is now's five room
like five room
and then after that if you want to talk like realistically
like I wouldn't even spend
more than four hundred thousand
on a house
my whole life paying for the house
ya
the house this house that I'm staying at used to cost like only like one hundred and eighty K
and now it's like
super high eh

if let's say I want okay ah since my dream house is the what's that called
the a pool of that one right
if I ya golf club

ya I remember I saw the vinny guy lah and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him ah
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at shu then I was like eh
maybe we just go closer look ah then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like um you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
err
and straits times so I was like thinking oh shoot I should have like told shu about it lah cause shu is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to err
like at least advance ah cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that shura is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right
wait that's this is a good question would you ever date someone younger than me
ya
I'm twenty four this year
I'm twenty four lah
and you're almost thirty
ya
no as in
you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you
just want to put it out there
ya anyway um
we brought madrina in the conversation
err what's the word ah uh
or maybe that is a
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
err a few days
after my birthday ya
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off
can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
ugh
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go uh university exchange because look at rifqi he's still so close with his two friends like eh I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
wah
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december eh
and this sem okay lah given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast

Airbnb where you get where you get comfy bay you get comfy pillow comfy
toilet comfy kitchen hall living room oh my god ah that is so nice and we don't have to go far lah we just
all we want is just maybe to go to our neighbouring country you know like malaysia
err I I'm not sure because I don't think they have like us safe entry or maybe trace together
and um I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then um
because johor has err strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because err the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if johor um numbers demote back ah but I think after a week it does in its red zone
mm
ya I still have my dirt bike to go oh my god
ya it's on the date it was it's on the day that
err the government of malaysia actually wanted to close down the borders
I was like oh my god
I I paid two hundred sing dollars for the dirt bike you know
I didn't even get to go and I was like should I and and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
err ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve you see ya just say twelve so
I was texting I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like hey I get this um news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay

mm
mm
mm

ya
mm
mm or their business may flop you see
ya I saw like um
the europe
country is new zealand and I don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country lah singapore to actually go over there without having to um
isolate ourselves lah but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks
so I'm like and the cases in europe ah
you know higher
ya actually lah because it's like you know
mm
mm mm mm mm
I think this is the err this is worse than SARS man
ah okay lah that's nonsense lah we all know that's nonsense you see
ya there are some like you know they are being hospitalised for a month or so like six months three months four months and some are in
so it's like if it were to be that easy I don't think any other countries will have second lockdown you know
that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
um we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask

and then like your recent family gathering you know like uh
you just have to hush hush so that you know your neighbours won't know about it and all those stuff
so it's a sad thing lah that what we used to do you can't now so ya and and then they're and then
ya I mean we're so used to having two thousand people coming down for your wedding but then now is like
it used to be five and then ten then fifty now two hundred but I think still

but how you want to justify it doesn't
false declarations no was dry
daddy bear
he wants the freedom
because
is it block leave or clear instructed
oh you got your zoom ward meeting

what hospital
it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it lah but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay lah but it's a it's a service free

my guy I got one I think I I got one ah
british guy
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no oh my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so ah the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
ah supposedly there is lah but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad lah ya
what
huh
hais can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then
so that's where I learn photoshop lah but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family lah yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad ah then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no lah
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend lah we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
ah I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me lah
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it lah I won't I won't lose sleep over it
ya
all going out for supper party not all all thank you
she can speak chinese what then trilingual
K bye swee ling
papa bear and aunty bear go for breakfast
so mama bear not in all the bears go out today
went already what just now ya he was in office
ya which you quite elated right because of how he looks
ya the company closed down what company is it ah huh
oh jamco
jamco I think
because that time one of like because one of my classmates he's like working for those kind of companies kan the engineering stuff and then he didn't see that they are going through retrenchment soon or something like that at that point of time during our exam so like very busy
why really what you watch big bang theory big bang theory not really
uh
the only the only constant is change
I know ya the only constant thing is change
it is do you do you restart
let's say you were not actually doesn't matter lah
no no no what I meant doesn't matter is just okay did you apply through the app
any customers yet
no no one has reached out to yellow door yoga
Y D Y
yellow door yellow door Y D Y Y Y yellow door
come to yellow yoga
balance
can there's a lot of people doing it so you got to be ya you find a niche what
got no cases what
oh are you hungry
no I have not
well my wife say she'll wake up in the morning for breakfast but apparently she didn't wake up
ah no it's like that
so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that one starhub what I don't know
oh
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to lah have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy lah you have to but this one because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy lah the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this one but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software err no it's in english
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
okay lah
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course lah
so you have to go down to go to the thing
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language uh
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form ah so
which one
oh ya
ah no because in october
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
siala no I just I just told her you try december lah no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay lah november december
I don't know lah but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply lah said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't lah cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on lah even with our colleagues also some of them also huh what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
it's been awhile already
it's been almost two years since I did it

um but I think
they will change I think
I mean okay lah that one I let people go to the extreme
sabo sabo king
err
but daddy bear actually could ah not really cause the one outside technically the switch is inside yup no the thing is it is cold then just shift lah maybe your side is what you you're technically under the vent oh ya actually she cannot if you think is no I never honestly why would I touch it's there ya ya here so that time like julie did ask me like but I was doing work

I thought it was going so good but then after we went our separate ways I saw that he block me on every single social media platform and even my number
I have no idea leh it it was going so well or at least I thought it was going so well I made jokes he laugh he made jokes I laugh

ah ya ya ya do whatever you want or like eh no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that ah I want
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me ah
that that sounds so wrong eh
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
oh this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl leh
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky pe seh but like that time in
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like wahseh so cute
huh really
ah
oh my god are you serious
ya huh
ya
uh huh
maybe maybe he was acting cool you know like those big macho guys like oh my god girl loves me they say the inside themselves
but then you know but then on the inside there also like what the heck this girl likes me she's crazy
uh huh
what lah this boy this what you was talking to his ex when he kind of likes you and then after he is with you then the ex wants to right wasn't that the story

basically same story as you he was with this girl but then they broke up okay they already separate ah
they ya they already separate then suddenly when the guy wants to be with another girl suddenly the ex girlfriend came running back
why you are you with girl why you with this girl blah blah blah blah then I was like what seh this huh
when he told me the story I was so confused wasn't she not with him anymore and the thing is right she broke up with him ya ya ya ya
wah
okay like ya after that um once I got to know the story of course I cannot confront her right because I not I not in their relationship what
and but the thing is I don't know how
I got roped into this drama and somehow the girl thought the guy was cheating on her with me
ya ya that's true
because we did we did clarify it with them
the girlfriend lah I'm not I'm not so sure what's happening with her but
ya
ya you you used to hate her so much eh I I found that so funny
turntables or the table turn
I wanted to watch the office but I don't have the
uh huh

ya the cameraman would just bend into everyone's faces
ya
the office singapore version but ya this this that's so far the only drama I have in my life
at mmhmm
eh mmhmm
woo spicy tell me
ah
yes
mmhmm
alright
ya
mmhmm
what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest ah of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing eh we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say eh don't do it don't do that leh like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace err
mmhmm
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
uh huh
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed pe
mmhmm what is on your plate
uh huh
nine thirty as it wait what time do you start work again
what life this girl my my office hour starts at eight leh
okay ah wait how long does it take for you to get home let's say you from the office ah
okay fine wait but that's the same timing I have ah to get home
uh huh
you know what topic I'm interested in talking about our good friend J J J J J
no
our good friend jannah
you know we're we're talking about the relationship topic just now right I suddenly remembered her it remember when we went to her house
huh no no no
does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know lah like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her leh it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend
how about allan friends allan's cousins allan family is huge eh
oh my god ya that's you know what this is is a this is a hard thing to do we want to find someone good for her but at the same time we feel like our friends aren't good enough for her
so how she's already up there shaza

mm mm
elections I
oh I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
hmm
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like um to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya uh huh
ya oh ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course lah their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess lah it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
nowadays kan everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video ah it's like satire and then it's basically ah
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk oh woke culture no I never heard of that leh
mmhmm
a'ah
suit so
like in ah if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now I'm talking to you oh I feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so I have to keep adding in defending points lah
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get ah okay I understand now what lah these people
mmhmm
yes
eh sorry
equity
as in as in financial management equity
equity
a'ah
ah okay okay okay ya
mmhmm
A two
oh unbelievable oh uh uh ya
alhamdulillah
that's true ya okay what is the most fun aspect or memory about that you have
ya ya
that's true
ya ya ya ya
they do ya they do care about us until now they do care about us
ya it is not an obligation to them right for them it's just a natural thing to do
oh my god I knew that mah ya
okay
okay like you already recall right these fun times you or like those non-judgmental times you had in and we will remember this is the most non-judgmental thing you remember or not we were in and then um
basically the girls can put colours in their hair they can
ah I don't know dress ah wear like outstanding jackets and then the guys would taper their pants I don't know in in those little ways it just shows their
their how to say ah their creativity their expressions and oh my god that's so good
ya
yes
miss judy and mister farhan to be honest
yes we really didn't like them
ya but I get you we we didn't really like them because I I have no idea I guess we weren't used to people being harsh to us we were still babies you know we were from secondary school and stuff like that
and ya and ya basically we didn't get to be scolded most of the time so once we got scolded by them
we we felt attacked in a way
um yes
is this relatable woman she you remember when she said that she would drink with most as we some of the seniors like after they graduate of course at the right age remember that drinking isn't responsible before the right age
ya mmhmm
was ya one of the best times of my life though
yes ya
uh huh
err
it's okay it's fine
mmhmm
ah oh oh my god
it's the sisterly affection oh like oh my god that made me recall something
ya
miss really I am not lesbian I have nothing against lesbian I like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it I like boys I really liked boys thank you for your concern
I think I think mister alan was the one who told her because um our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya I guess okay I I guess I put myself up to it ah cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but I cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if I wanted to fix my scarf right I would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school I'd rather go ah go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
oh my god you believe that story how lah correct correct okay
I
everyone knows that story was fake lady
oh
okay let me tell you ah the the real story was that I was fighting with my cats
I was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other I naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
I'm not lying to you now I only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so I was I was there ah and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya I always talk to my cats like the humans so I'm like
stop it lah what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then I put my hand in between them then one of them
oh got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding ah
because they follow the owner I'm their owner so if I'm aggressive I'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means I'm sweet ah
then ya so basically I put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and I cannot do anything about it I'll just
decided or I'll just wash a bit then I go to school lah I go to school then mister alan thought I was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture I I merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face I put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match I look like mister alan in a young girl's body and I felt
weird later I will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up I guess woo poly aww
I feel like ya I feel like going back right I had I don't know
I want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
I I guess so I don't know I guess ya and then but the thing is I feel like we should also move on lah

shiq
like
in this life
like what would you ask for
I see I see I see
to be honest
like
because
uh but I would I would say money
err
money
err
a good
love life
err and health to all my
so ya that's why I would ah I would want lah
to me ah
err
genie
actually believe ya ya ya
ya true
but
but like like
how what about like uh
relationships
like what I said ah about love life and like bringing err health to my family like what do you think about that ah
ya like like why why won't you wish for like a promised err and err a love life
something something like that ah mm
I mean um
I mean my love life it's
it's been a lot ah
for
all my life
it's been a ride lah in terms of my love life or my err
so like
ya to me like
for it's
it's important because
I think like if you live without love and like
err
I think you can live life right ah I think you will live a good life or I think like that ah like
err
think about
I mean
I mean like one more thing about
uh
kan
okay one more another
uh
your life is easy ah life is simple and like
if everything you want you get no you don't have to work hard for it
ya like
as in ya lah
so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
like
okay um
uh in a girl for you to you know
basically uh
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable lah like I don't think everyone would
eh ah like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that ah so like
catch my eye is err is the girl funny ah to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
I mean like uh
if I would say myself this is called green flag ah for like if they can make me laugh
like a lot of the girls lah
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
you know
and ya I've only met like what
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
um
so what you think ah
I mean you're being very honest already ah with me like been telling uh yours your
stories about your ex
like I want I want to be honest ah also like share
with you about mine my first one was
ah
a'ah
but then like
uh I will just uh
and then uh I went for it I went for it and then
ah sweat and then
and what would I want to what would I want to answer right like I I I don't know if I can think properly ah
ah
hi like uh I think you're I think you're pretty and um you know you seem like such a a nice girl to you know talk to and err I hope you don't mind if uh if I wanted to be friends with you ah
and uh
ah switch off switch on
freshen up
she doesn't mind ah so I was like uh wow
was like oh wow and then my reply was oh wow I didn't expect her to be because I
I was in a fifty fifty ah thing ah where I expect her
uh you know I will just
overjoyed ah I was over I was just overjoyed ah and excited to you know ah talk to her and then she said like she didn't mind and then I
err oh wow
I didn't expect her to reply and then uh
so we we talk and then after that we started to talk ah she was like replying
constantly and then uh
ah
oh K K
in her and I was like
in front of my me
ah
and then
it went ah it went well
uh it went well until
you know she was
the first day lah
ah
and then uh
you know you were happy and then we went our first date ah
okay ah everything went well and then at this one point ah
and then she and then like
ah she just said that
um
the whole thing
like your first
uh huh
as in
oh
almost everything ah and then
uh
ah
they didn't
you could say that uh you could say that it was long ah
and it was my the first time what so I didn't know what to do so I was like
and when I was in denial I was like
still uh
I wouldn't say want to force ah it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her lah but maybe maybe it was ah
it was just so heartbreaking ah you know for me
ah
cold also she said thanks that's all like literally that's all
and then that was I guess
err the last straw ah
final one
ya
ah then ya then basically I just move on ah because it was my first I don't know what to do I feel scared
so I just I had to move on with life and I did ah somehow I did
I mean I guess it was good for me ah I was the first
you know and uh you cannot expect the first to be your last
I mean um
that's one
err but I guess
a'ah lah
as in example ah
um
the second one
the second one okay the second one
for feeling this way because
she was my second and I'm already having
okay so this my second ah it was in my
my you know uh it was my first year in NITEC
and
err I saw her ah
and then
contact ah and then
and uh just looking around ah I'm just like
and then
same thing you know
ah I was excited you know again I felt that way somewhat I fell away again
and then you know we talk know I was excited I was entertained
she was very funny
okay she was very funny um
uh I like her ah pretty much the from the start I was like I like
ah
I never thought like it would be with this girl and then like
and you know we went to dates we went to everything she was funny know she entertain me she understood me err
you know again
this
uh
um
err
she's not feeling it anymore ah
and
ah
and then again ah like like just the previous one again like again everything I thought it was going good you know and
I saw her as this girl that
she was just perfect ah in even in her most
a touchy thing to say so ya and I'm being honest ah like she was like even in her imperfectness I saw perfectness ah so
she was my ideal girl ah in
in in fact ah you know like
so when she said that I was like
in shock and like again I took it
I I can say I took it better than the previous one ah how I took it was better
you know
so I say like and and then when I tried to like talk her out of it I talk about the last relationship the last relationship like how I went to go with it you know how I pestered
so I told her like ah okay lah then I cannot do anything about it
I just want you to be happy ah that's
so
err
and I'll I still do ah still do care about her ah
um
you know and she's
amazing ah so till this day she's still amazing ah and
so I move on with uh my life and she move on with hers so she give
she give me her closure in her own way and uh you know
we stick out we somehow made it as a friends ah you know
ya so ya I guess somehow we made it as friends you could say friends ah till this day because we still
mm
ah
I think she got with like
err in total like
two guys after me so
and then
ah
we were just friends time and time again I will ask about her I will ask her like how's
how it was good how it was going you know for her
and
because I truly cared for her ah like I could say after the break up I
even till this day I could say that
I would say I still think like about her like what she's doing like how is she is she fine
and
on occasionally as I said ah I would ask her ah
you know she also ask me like how am I doing and like
update me on some stuff
then to me it's fine ah I think to me what we have is
I think I believe that both of us what I believe is we both have
we like to believe that we both have moved on ah and I think I moved on
like in fair enough to say I moved on ah just that I just care about her as as some as someone
who
was special to me at one point in my life
and then um
we so we just kept in contact and then I met this girl
err and she was also with another man
if I'm not wrong ah
no ah it was very mature ah for me it was mature ah as much as
it was a mature relationship between me and her it's not like we meet meet still meet up or what you know
ah
err
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days ah some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone ah I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
ah
something like that ah
oh ah
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now err
I was
still in process ah honestly I was still in process ah low-key I was still in process
but
err
somehow I I
I move on ah I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is ah and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
err I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
ah I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
um
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay ah maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening ah
but it feels it feels like a crime ah sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having ah because I really love what we are having already ah so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good ah
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask lah like
what what what went wrong
ah
okay so it's like
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride ah I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous ah
my previous
girl lah and
to me it's fine I guess you know uh as you said also I think it's fine ah
so and it's okay ah
um
mm
but
doing my best as well ah so if it goes to where
but if not
like
uh
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
okay okay
first thing
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is uh
you know I learnt how to accept
err
third thing thing is uh I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time ah
um
true ya what you said is true ah and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons ah
and
uh I guess so far it's been great ah when
I don't want to say
I don't want to say she's my last
but I hope so
good thing like in what way
or like
err
ah

lagi bagus daripada macam one big portion in like three meals
ya honestly but then I couldn't stop once even when I stopped playing soccer
ya life goes on we have to move on
mm

hey nurul
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right mm
what is your ideal vacation like
oh for me kan I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
ya lah for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
this small staff lah these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya oh mm so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because uh
it's to me it's one of a kind ah and then like uh so many different
see experience all the different species in one area lah in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the kampung glam area
ya about the old school stuff like uh sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya oh ya and I want to know mm which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like err
drama like between people I mean I prefer uh movies lah because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
and then like after that uh
um oh there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun oh then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
uh it's called kahani ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that um
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so err ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
yes
ya so like eh I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
oh what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
mm
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch um
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important lah so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
ya so very cool cartoons lah and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first uh
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
um
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
orh ya lah soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like oh he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the ah every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
oh I like this question because I like wishes
uh
oh not a lot of people will say food why why why food
mm
unusual superpowers wah I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya lah that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think uh the reading about minds one sometimes uh I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is um
actually why one thing ah why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
oh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that uh people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
eh then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like oh it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
wah so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun lah
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like wah how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like uh art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true oh then I wanna ask um
mm
think for me mm
four episodes ya and then err the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts leh like it's too bad lah this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
uh then like mm
for me kan my uh
a higher price
ya lah so like for me uh
as a frequent concert goer kan you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that oh my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to uh dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then uh if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and err I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me kan uh
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like err personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this one eh your hardest question eh how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like um say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me uh just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
oh I was thinking
mm korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
chey cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane lah so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as uh language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
like eh quite cool leh like oh and then like uh ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
oh that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower lah but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right wah they were so cool
ya
very cool and like um
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see um err what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then err
so ya lah I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool

letting you resign you stay for one more year okay then I stay for one year so six years already at the end of the six years the the yearly review you know the one to one talk with the bosses then I said okay I'm gonna to resign already no no no you stay for one more year okay dah stay I there they manage to stop me
so after seven years when I went into the living room I went in I sit down with my manager and my director before I sat down I told them okay both of you be quiet I'm going to talk
I told them I'm going to resign and there's nothing both of you can say that I that will make me stay okay so that's that I don't want to hear my grade I don't want to hear how much bonus you wanna give me I want to resign

oh world of married
what is it about
oh
oh
mm
oh
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like Syamsul Yusof right
I feel very sad for him seh cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life seh
hmm
but I don't know eh cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then um
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
uh children I think one of it
uh is a guy one is a girl
then um I know Puteri uh which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
uh divorce right
it really shows that
maybe Syamsul did something ah but I don't know seh
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like um
marriage and everything
and then actually uh on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick eh but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
wah if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
seh like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than um
like Syamsul Yusof all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know Alif Aziz
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like Alif is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like oh
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel um
um scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
mm
but I think it's also because um he
I mean the other girls were like not even
um saying sorry or anything
oh your hair
um I don't know seh I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it ah
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
ah
from ten to to eh
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
uh okay lah but like I feel like food is nicer
ah which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what ah
ya
oh my dance classes eh
um
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
mmhmm
then isn't it better
oh ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay lah
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they chiong last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I chiong last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know seh
but ya and then
oh did I tell you I met
uh our soccer friends
ah our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me ah
ah my our campus is
ah Dover
ya
ya oh my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website ah where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review ah
ya and I thought of buying it ah cause like
I feel like
mmhmm
why fifty dollar quite a lot what
oh
but I think in your
because you only receive like nine hundred ah spending money how to save
ya
eh I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay lah not that
direct nine hundred ah but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
mm I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
orh for Anas eh
ya I mean I feel for Anas right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple eh
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even Dakshah had to ask him out
mm
ya that's true
depends ah
uh a bit of physics but other than that no
oh did mama tell you that
oh
mm
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also lah I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
um
doesn't work that way you know
oh he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
oh he did huh what did he do
oh
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
orh but how much were you paid per month
huh fifty jer
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
oh my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya lah you can say like oh you want to help the child everything but wow
that progress and also the time spent right
but really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it seh
ya I mean
minahish and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
um the
scary ah that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it seh like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever seh
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just um try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
oh but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
oh
oh my gosh okay
ah why he like that seh
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she ah when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
wah early twenties then she act until like that
oh
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
oh when was I there
oh
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with seh
mm
oh my god ya it was during like the
um
exam kan
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
oh I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her oh my god
err
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma lah to be honest
mm
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram ah it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted eh
wilting eh
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal lah but then
they brew their coffee eh no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
a'ah Singapore
huh why you ask me that
oh um
haiya for me
hmm let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say oh I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
ah
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head ah
ah
ya
I I don't know ah
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
mm
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment ah it's like why would you keep them there seh
oh actually ah
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
oh
mmhmm
I mean those are just news lah I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also what
orh
uh huh
I'm pretty sure the animals are being fed and everything
don't worry lah

is aching

I really want to go

mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
how much was your kurta
okay
still okay
mm
ya
escalator escalator
ya
so I had to win that game
mm
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games err and this just brought me back to
early times ah I guess
mm
um the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
mm
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
mm
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then eh ya
oh ya ya ya
mm
I
oh congkak yes
ah but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
congkak yes I actually really like congkak
okay
where it's like a kampung where it's design and and like err painted in a way that looks like a kampung so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya err ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands lah so
mm
ya ya
mm
mm ya something like that ya ya ya mm
yes yes that one is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that one never play before
the ya
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya oh my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
mm
mm
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working ah full time right now um in an office I work in an office job for a business school
um so I'm just giving you a bit of context lah eh um I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's err and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that err sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no lah
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business eh
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already um on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
um like her story
ah okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
my number one idol when it comes to business
err I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
err ya ya fenty fenty became
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya oh no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable lah so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products ah like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like err area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then um she also has
err like a luxury line which I forgot ah I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're wow this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business mm
I I think what success is
is like maybe lah for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
mm mm
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
mm
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so um
um the account was giving seventy K seventy K
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus err the iphone new iphone
I
oh I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to err to um settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
wow fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty mm
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
mmhmm
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there lah but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell lah
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why ah you you ask me that before
mmhmm
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach ah and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
mm
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like oh I can afford this you know like so it comes with it lah
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
mm
mm mm
okay sure
mm
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
ah the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
hmm
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
mm
you not actually nurse
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
no let's not talk about that but I don't have lah
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
mm nurse eh maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate lah
doctorate degree
mm
doctor fazil
doctorate
and doctorate is like
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like err
I believe there are some err owners here as well how you all get in this one have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further lah I don't know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner wow
ah ah
ya
ya ya ya ya
wah bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya like
err okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a err not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor banu doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
mm game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish err it's not that fun lah
it's okay lah
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
oh well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward err ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
um
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
mm food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
mm
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but um ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya lah we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference aww but err I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person ah but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
um like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like um
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress ah to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders ah it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and err
mmhmm
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
err but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
err I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you um sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

alright
ah
tenet
okay ah basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
this is less still shady ah
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire lah
once in the
ah
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot lah close to one thousand
yup that's it ah
at least that's the only thing I know of ah
uh his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money ah
ya
oh that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this ah
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month lah cause our initial agreement was six months what
uh next year
friend ah
no one listens to me kan
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care ah that kind of thing ah
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed ah
rightfully so ah to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not ah
that kind of situation ah
ya basically lah same thing ah
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it ah
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend ah rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
eh
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know oh but
you know people are driven by greed what some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you what
um
ya he left
uh some cash cause I don't know ah he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
mm
mm
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap ah
okay
so
mm
sort of
fahim no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know lah whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl lah
I mean technically there is a plague going on ah
okay
okay
mm
mm
okay
hmm
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably lah eh
mm
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does tau maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
ah
ya ya like it it's inside lah and so it's called what you said is right correct pe
ya
why you were there lah at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it lah cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend ah
um
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right what
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that oh I'm approving this ah it feels wrong ah
so it puts us in a tough spot ah
back then ah
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical farid lah
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
oh
okay
mm
what the
okay
hmm
loco ah
I wouldn't
know what
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if riz there she's there
so we knew what to expect ah
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
um from what I see eh
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs ah maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here ah ah the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him ah
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks ah
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all lah definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common lah no lah just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
ah recklessness um
probably lack of ambition
ah ya privilege ah ya lah
usually
usually lah generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things ah
generally speaking ah
so based and on that
um
scenario like you always quite common ah for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible lah I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest lah even
not not even the fittest man alive ah
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
oh did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already lah
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist ah
it's nonsense
ya
sial lah brunei
ya
mm
oh is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
mm
oh
mm
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government eh
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism ah
for investment
attack tourism ah
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia lah but still quite bad lah
if you look at the ah if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free lah it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
ah then uni isn't free
ya it should be lah or very heavily subsidise ah
but it's not okay ah let's talk about
oh so just now you wanted
to ask about
oh khai right
ya
anything lah
ya
oh
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her lah
too trivial lah to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk kan
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that lah
oh mistress
well he consented to it lah so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know ah
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out wai was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal lah him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant lah rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married lah if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her lah personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
oh six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine what it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it lah
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
oh okay ah
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
safwan told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is saifuddin
then zafran I think zafran has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her lah
so I don't know
oh when life is good
eh
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult ah
huh
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
ah still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on ah
healthy ah range
but ah same lah
a
ya louder that ah
true
didn't factor that in ah
sial lah
err should be more
actually should use the malaysia malaysia one
eh should be more accurate for malay
sial ah
ah yes
one six seven
you're going to do it now
of what obesity
ya average or healthy ah
ya
wah slightly above average ah okay pe
okay lah
chonky
ya I remember
I remember
absolute unit ah
I think the heaviest I was I think lah cause I didn't check my weight for very long time think seventy I think so then it was it was good lah that that I went for the christmas dinner
I should do something about it lah
then it was difficult lah initially very difficult
then
no no no no
yup
then food
mm
hmm
ya there's the fruit
smoothie eh
wow okay okay

his side okay okay ya
the guy's side ya
ya fair enough ah
they barely know her her family I don't think they even though that he's going to convert
I'm not sure lah whether he knows eh they know
so it's unfair for them
orh okay
making up for lessons eh
seriously
oh
oh
mm
german probably
orh
mm ya ya ya
oh okay okay okay ya fair enough ya I was thinking more along the lines of
are you sure you want to took destroy okay

mm
ya
ya
based on what happened so far
is it germany cannot remember
they are really really well even after taking in a lot of ah american refugees
which one ah
is it australia
sial

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go

so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness
ya the smokiness was only on the skin
uh
ya
uh ya lah
mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer
when you make simple ghee rice
with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh
the biggest one
it's very filling
ya
mm
okay
then tomorrow what are you making
reheat the mandi rice
with ghee rice
okay you should teach you should teach me uh how to make ghee rice
how how do you make ghee rice
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
I think I like the basmati rice
okay one cup
okay
onions okay
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
okay
ya ghee rice lah
mmhmm
uh huh
okay
oh
okay
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
oh
rendang
ya
mm
oh
curry
mm okay
mm okay
so that's what you are making tomorrow
mmhmm
ya
no it's okay
mm
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring um rice we can bring prep rice cooker
uh huh
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can uh I think you just bring to the room and
ya
or stew
ya no lah it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more what
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back what
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say what monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months what it's just one semester six months
oh eh not six months lah three months of school
so
no school uh just come back uh three months later
ya
she's working in what
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
mm so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies lah
so ya she already graduated what she she no no and then
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working lah and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that lah to make money
ya
ya kan just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature what
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
uh but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
uh huh
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you eh school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go ah
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
mm okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one

ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
ya
uh because the thing is like uh when I first saw the trailer
I was quite behind the hype already lah in a way
ya
um
orh okay
ya because uh
when I started uh I think I don't know how like err I was in cause I think um a lot of people watch already but ah even then when I watch later the hype was still there so err the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so uh I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the manga eh I I'm gonna read the manga sorry not watch ya but it was really good lah ya
mm
then it ended
orh september
oh ah ah
ah
oh one shot ah
rise up ah ya
ya
mm mm
naruto
ah
mm
ya
ah um avengers endgame ah
very rare so I was blown away ah
ah no lah ya ya
mm mm
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when uh nezuko and tanjiro killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off what it's such a coward move but gui is just
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
mm
blow me away it's okay
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
uh I think that's the main ah unique point of ah demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
mm
correct correct
mm
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
mm
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that uh um
one piece eh uh because uh naruto the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
oh
mm mm
ya
mm
orh short film
mm
ya
ah
pe
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
uh bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science one science is programing ah ya
ya
mm
mm
that's why
ya ah the the velocity part I think
ah
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
mm
mm
oh
mm famous ah ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
mm
mm
correct
mmhmm
ya ya correct
mm
mm mm
ya
ya
when I started
mm
mm mm
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
people think like you don't do your err revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is ah sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
mm
ya
oh this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
mm
mm
mm
oh okay okay
mm
ya ya correct correct
mm
ya
uh ya ya ya ya ya
but it depends on the person itself lah but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice ah ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
ya
ya
ah
ah
mm
correct correct
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best lah cause over time like you have to
um adapt ah I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
uh
err for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest ah this one I haven't share with you before uh so um
I kind of err didn't sit for my paper
ya so err this news right I'm just telling you this um okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that um if you don't sit for your paper
and then uh if you have err I think the requirement for the assignments is like err forty percent and above that means your over ah there are two components uh assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without err redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod ah so
for me
okay lah for me since I'm new to it lah like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
orh
oh
like like
oh range oh okay okay okay
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to lah cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right oh for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different ah assignments and projects ya so because your school is uh assignment and project based my one is ah exam so that's the thing you all also have err
intermittent exams right
math oh my goodness
don't have err
uh not exactly math but I think err since your mum is a english teacher she should know also err there's this thing called err phonetics and um what is it under ah it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like um if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
um put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a um sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part lah
uh
there is one ya ya there is uh the uh what mod I took I think they taught us about err there are some similarities uh between err varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
mm
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
um ya lah because essentially
err they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office sia
oh ya but okay lah uh that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about err
language and society like how people use language and all that that one is more to um
I would say uh you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how ah different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
ah dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's uh in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of err analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now eh I wish I I don't have to take is uh literature
but they rebrand it so like no choice ah I just stayed ah cause I have to defer for err one semester
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct
ya
ya
even more pissed off ya ya ya ya
mm mm
mm
yes yes correct correct
mm
ah
ah
seven K
correct correct
ya
because it's quite mentally draining tau if you set the bar too high so you must slowly find the small things that make you happy lah ya and and I heard this phrase before like um
uh sometimes the things that makes us the happiest right doesn't require money ah
ya that's that's that's the most priceless thing that that that that is a golden code lah
correct correct
ya
ya
because they are tuned to it ah
mm
yes
correct correct
mm
yes
correct
correct
ya
you're satisfied ah ya correct correct yes yes
that's why
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
wah that's quite advanced eh
ya ya
ya
gen Y ya correct eh gen Y or millennial
orh millennial
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
correct correct
ya
correct ah
mm
ya
correct correct it's like uh it's like an experience uh like um err it takes you on a ride I guess like uh
ride off
what what am I trying to say like roller coaster in motion ah sorry sorry I can't get my thoughts right so it's a it's a good thing like it like it's a temporary escape from reality and like uh you get to experience something and then you just move on in your life ah is
ya
mm
correct correct
mm
ya
demon slayer ya
mm
ya
mm mm yes yes yes
ya
orh yes yes yes
ya
ya correct
ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
ya
ya
correct uh there's one prime example uh I think is everyone's favourite
wait is he is not right ah Marvel cinematic universe ah iron man ah he don't have any powers but like he he's uh drive to make the world a better place and too um I think in age of ultron he said he want to like uh have a iron barrier around earth uh to like sort of protect lah but um even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like uh protect what's what matters to him the most ah so like um
get the power from your own uh
err
his ability to uh be a genius
and like uh construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it lah like people always look at the uh powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
uh thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right ah and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes ah and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
I think she was like err um
uh assassin or some sort then she got um err close combat err training and iron man is just err a man with a suit lah but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite err touching ah if you think about it no power tau
mm
ya
correct
yes
mm
mm
ya ya
ya
mm
it motivates you ah in a way
ya
mm mm
mm
ya
higher
mm
mm
mm
mm
yes
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people ah
mm
yes
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice um
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now ah eh I'm working part time lah ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry ah but my job got suspended because of COVID so like err I cannot work for the meantime so um I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy ah but it's you're on the right track ah so it is relevant lah it's a good thing
mm mm
mm mm
ya
mm
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
ya
so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the err pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
mm
ya
ah
ya you need to um get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation
ya ya
ya ya
ah
mm
mm
tip top ah
nobody want to play ya ya ya correct correct
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
element eh
and in it's an ingredient for you to
mm
ya
it's very useful
ya
ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like err I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering uh the zero gravity there is quite uh
quite intense ah so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve uh being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something ah
ya cause if he want to be married eh buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's why
ya
it's another planet
ya
mm
mm
moon burger
ya ya ya
space Grab
ya but how many light years away is mars ah
I never thought about it eh
ya
oh it's not light years
years
oh but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough eh
I don't know how they do it sia seriously
ya ya ya correct
err ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive ah then you wouldn't die ah
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm mm
that's right
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress ah then like you just stay stagnant ah like uh because it's not affecting you what and that's the thing about humans lah like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
change ah the ah sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change ah but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the manga or the watch the uh talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of um
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph ah
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
mm
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to err
is bangkok the correct word like a way to um set the bar like I I err do as an inspiration ah in a way
ya
so that's the good thing
mm
undertaker
yes oh my god my favourite wrestler then he retire
mm
ya
ya
impact
ah diego maradona
that's quite sad ah
ah ya
mm
ya
I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb eh I guess ah when people pass on they look at the good things ah and they try to overlook the uh bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
um his negative aspects um err
even though they were quite drastic but uh the achievements overshadow that ah but in the end when everyone passes on right is um
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them ah recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper um
what's the word eh passing eh no um ah final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status err for awhile then like um at least you um go in peace ah like ya you don't feel like oh um
there's anything left
ah ya ya ya you you feel like err a burden off your shoulder ah in a way
what's why
mm
making one of the best anime
oh my goodness
ya
mm
that's why it's amazing how this um shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
uh

oh okay
that's the part where we decide if we should get out or not right
yes
yes
hais
why don't you go first
mmhmm
yes the bunny chow
uh huh
yes
ya and I feel like it was a new experience in terms of how they presented it
a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah
yes yes
and it was a it was a weekday it was a normal weekday working day kind of thing
mm mm mm
yes we were very hungry
ya
ya and then I feel it's also the the service
yes we did but it was it was a day of of trying food it was a it was a food adventure day ya
yes
oh okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya
yes
and uh that was quite nice also
I felt
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like wow a whole new experience ya
ya
yes
not spicy
ya not not up to our standards our tongues
ya
just just another day
yes we did we did
ya our our spice game was
was really showing on during that trip like we really felt it
ya
ya so after that we tried steelers and that was good what else did we try that day or did we call it a day afterwards
I think we also went to this err the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community
ah so we went over there and tried
but I forgot what exactly did we try do you remember
ah
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
ah
uh huh
I think two three years
oh god
a'ah ah ah ah
ya
mm was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's a different history and everything lah
different background
ya ya ya
mmhmm but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
is it prata
ya
uh huh uh huh
ya ya ya
wow
oh my god bo-kaap okay ya
uh huh
what does it look like
is it like a pani is it like
is it like Subway is it
ya I think I think the memories are coming back okay ya
it was basically like
loaded in every ways
ah
ya
did we keep it for another day I feel like ya
oh gosh
oh shit
LOL
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya ya that was too much for me cause ya
I remember eventually I was picking it apart like
ya ya
ya
ya ya ya
yes yes cause they couldn't
ya
ya
and that that was really what it felt like what if if anyone out there wants to know how it tastes it's rich
uh huh uh huh ya ya
ah ya the gatsby ya that's what it's called ya
gosh
we ate a lot of ya
yes
feel like that whole trip was a it was a whole lot of trial and error and just pure excitement on our part but at the end of the day it was a it was a great experience
we didn't do anything stupid that's the good thing
I mean it we did a lot of stupid things but nothing regrettable okay you know nothing like I go back and I'm like oh what did I do you know it was just oh we did a lot of weird stuff I guess
oh shit that was stupid
ah
a'ah
mmhmm
a'ah
we are
ya ya ya
yup
mm
brain not functioning
mmhmm
yes
yes
forgot man
oh okay okay
ya ya ya
it was a bit weird but okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm mm
mmhmm
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
mmhmm
mm mm mm
a'ah
ah
ah
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
yes
yes
you know right
oh it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go bukit timah hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
ah
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes
ah
yes there there was five three G or four G I remember
ya
ya
mmhmm
yes
we
ah
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
ah a'ah
oh
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
kan that was an experience friend
mm
lion uh huh
a'ah
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
ah I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
wah
ya we went quite ya damn early
mm mm
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
oh we haven't went
cause I I like
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero

ya
ya and then ya and then the weekend trip the the field trip is like forever you know they tell you we going on a field trip
takes like three hours to get there it was it's a completely different town
that kind of thing cause it's a big country but ya
ya ya
the field trip is like it's like hi we're going to the beach then like in singapore if I say to that you think of like east coast park over over there is like we're going to the beach and there are
actual penguins at the beach
like it was whole new thing

but ya and then we had what else
a'ah
mm
I don't okay not puberty you know when you're eighteen you do a lot of stupid shit it's like that ya like like that part where you

ya ya ya
ya
different school but we can trust them cause same land
yes
mm
mmhmm
yes
mm mm mm
yes
mmhmm
ah
ah ya avoid like we try to keep a distance ya
to spend time with him especially for activities that he need to pair up
a good trip for everyone and I feel like that was that was a good move on all our parts you know
cause I feel like even though the boy like
I mean
ya it's a bit questionable but I mean whatever lah ah after that we didn't keep in touch so whatever
it's okay we we did our part we did our our community service for the day community service
I feel like
I feel like we did good you know
like it's like eh
it's like it's a it's a good looking back wow matured
are you serious
but ya that was a really really fun trip I feel
mmhmm
oh gosh the kayaking
ya I remember I was I was really genuinely scared for my life
like I I really could have a panic attack if he just
uh gosh ya
um
the cave
the cave
your favourite
is it what you talk
uh huh
ya ya ya
ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
hais
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip lah if I had to look back at the things that I've uh did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
I want to learn how to draw
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
it's a certain skill lah that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level ah
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
err art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my uh colouring skills
cause that's also uh colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
mmhmm
what about you
just one ah
can
oh wow
yes that's the way
okay
I ah I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
wow
a'ah
oh wow
kind of what
okay
uh huh ah
ya it will
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh yes
did they die
oh gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so uh what else
two more skills
for me um other than drawing
mm
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember ah my dear friend wen xing were walking at this
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
oh shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak eh and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming lah ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point ah
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think wah it's like wow this girl really spend a lot of money to go krabi when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to krabi
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical uh suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her eh I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like eh shit she got kidnapped I die sia
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like uh if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping lah so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have lah but ya I also like uh and then my friend was also uh
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in krabi there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then err this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
nadi stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like eh shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is vishu
I'm like vishu we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with vishu is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over oh I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there eh no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
uh the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
ah cause err
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
err I a few people have jio me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya lah
ya ya ya
ya
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
more you already say live one another alone
ya ya wah I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain wah that one was another one cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
err I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time ah my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear vishu looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry nadi I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay vishu is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
mmhmm
but I remember that
it wasn't that long lah it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe err buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
but ya that was the only thing lah I was just like whoa
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next eh not not country
and then I remember in the beginning it was ah there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause ah they
they had other plans lah okay
ya
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
a'ah
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try lah like I don't know she will like says ah
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure eh maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it lah cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember ah ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like wah their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay oh I remember
and then I ask vishu then why you jio and then vishu was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you mah then I'm like shut up lah don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to vishu the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where ah ya krabi and vietnam with her
it's oh ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause uh our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this uh basically the two of them they have a a very uh err
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia lah
ya
oh ya
gosh oh ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
mmhmm
ya that's the thing
a'ah
okay
alright so how one two three one

huh serious
oh like that I play eh
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better eh no their
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
oh layla and eudora
but
but I think I want to try playing fighter also ah
hmm
but I hmm but I used to play assassin also ah last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
oh and the toxic player back then is
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
skin is
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
so if you wanna if you want me to play ah I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
hmm
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar karina anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow ah do you know that
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay lah if you say the toxic is already lessen
err
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range ah
err
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
hmm but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work uh huh
err
I got the premium skin the what is it called ah the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
take freya for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play freya eh freya but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play freya at all I think that one time when you did show me play freya and like I got eighteen kills kan
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
go back to ranking up lah I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay lah I will rank I will rank
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie eh like shows your survival later but wah I tell you when you play lor ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate lah
like wah I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
it gets boring kan I need a challenge also
mm that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay lor but so long okay lah so long you don't take aurora tho
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than vexana at least
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at freya if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my freya I will give it a head oh but
besides freya what else because you cannot play
dragon tales lah
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play balmond I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage eh
so like
and like balmond is like one of those free lah
choose balmond lah cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play balmond and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing kan
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a balmond
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a balmond
okay lah eh the eye
uh huh ya I did my research on hilda
do you know they revamp hilda that's why it's actually
uh
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so like recall button hilda they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
eh but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy hilda but I scared like wah I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her lah if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first lor cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
okay lah ya I think if we
well but I don't know lah I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
hylos I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like hylos cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
that's why I don't like hylos I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
then you go into the field full health
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
unless
worse eh
um
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
oh ah lah actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
oh no wonder then
mm then I guess hilda is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you oh ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
or am I
mm but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
I mean staycation is in january tho
we haven't even plan anything
uh and everytime I ask haizat
like
his answer with me like always kan always always like
till now even I ask him earlier also
his first reply
okay first day mm
like dude like all the way
I ask him again like
like I don't wanna keep him out of the planning cause like is a three people thing mah but then like I don't eh he's not even putting in efforts man
I would rather we
kinda like
maybe go for lunch even though
we are carrying a lot of bags lah but then um
can manage lah we eat
a full lunch first maybe and that's chicken and this okay wait no and there's vegetarian
okay first of all me and haizal just talk and he's taking two days leave because he's actually working on a saturday
then um so since he's night shift so he can actually
like working on that friday night also because friday saturday sunday
then he can like I mean he disappointed lah cause he cannot go school anymore so he got like ten days leave
then he was like saying since he's not going to school then might as well use that ten days leave for staycation lah
then um
so he don't mind using
two days for the staycation two nights lah
oh
and do you know that
um
on his last
last week before the end of I mean the new year lah so like december I think his last week in during december
oh
like no need go to work like
just stay home and chill that one really like wah christmas sia
ya
I don't see that happening
cause
okay let's have a meet up point punggol tampines and serangoon and it's one off so we all going one direction definitely one direction
then um
he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home
like earlier that was earlier
and like I'm not the one who has to work
at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into
like paying for my grab
so
so err we compromise so then he pay for hair he pay all
no lah not twenty seven he pay for the
altar
he pay for his ride only then I take bus I mean that's fair
now I'm side tracking the conversation so back to staycation so andes kan
um
it doesn't have to be andes we just see whichever is the
affordablenya
um
salad
mm good life
okay so weird we can have a lunch first
we go off lor to the two one of together
and I don't think we are going to no I'm pretty sure we're going to carry a lot of stuff if I were to be there with a suitcase
you have all the rights to just take my suitcase and smashed my head
do it
and then
buy me a
one of those
one of those what you call that one ah sports bag
ya put all my clothes there instead
yes
that that's a promise please if I bring a suitcase
oh wait
are we bringing a rice cooker
because if we are bringing our rice cooker again I need my suitcase
okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker kan
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still
and then I can
big like the pretty lah the pretty pretty
I think okay leh
fast leh
okay wait wait haizat don't eat spicy ah
oh my god
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be ah I did sidetracked but it's not like
oh and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt oh my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
kan
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point kan
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
haizat agrees
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
whoa you're only questioning it now dude you should have been oh okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are oh my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you huh what is this can you all please
do a collaboration someday or something huh
no lah just kidding lah
I am the the glue to
what are you two um
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
then we meet up earlier cause I know haizat won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like wah look at the bed
wah look at the sofa wah look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
mm I'm quite concerned because haizat haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
the feel of where we are
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning lah I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
okay okay so
ya lah like you imagine we play
um musical chair but this one is musical container
then like you run one round right then maybe me and haizat play first like whoever we scissor paper stone then one person go out then we chase you then after that one round I go back in then haizat
we scissor paper stone and then
okay what I can feel because today we gym at nine right
the waking up is quite a
quite a weight ah
and not only that right eh how do I feel when I woke up um
like quite ons to start my day leh
is that
did I shower after I gym oh ya I did I did I did shower did I I did
I did
I'm a clean
human being
oh wait um so after after day one what what what's day two
no no I can already tell where this is going
I think it's town area
okay but if we're
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport lah I mean like not that one hour journey and uh and uh how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
um okay lah I get okay you know what how about
I am so ons if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually haizat plan eh
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby lah but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
mm but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean eh no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far lah cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end leh
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on samyang man I mean uh
no brainer answer samyang all the way to cook samyang
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find samyang no those are not my intestine those are my samyangs
wait where am I going with this so besides samyang what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
haizat don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
oh ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay
so I think food wise should be fine some of us will go shopping before that
yes and we're going to fight over what movie to watch eh if haizat were to pull that lady gaga movie I have no words I will I'd rather watch
weak lah
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon oh wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
oh wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right siti farhanah
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
eh since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
um group there were just uh my little pony and err I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end
uh
oh ya we haven't do our staycay

but it's not really budget what it's okay lah
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body lah
well to be fair since you so paiseh I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like err chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot chope seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty err
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us what
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that dulan face
annoying sia he's going to give you even more dulan face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the err I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know ah the person is like the the nephew or eh no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue lah
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay lah
we
was it we dabao
no before we came before we ah err
I
ya ya
ya so is like
err what's that called it's nice oh but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten err ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years lah so she she scared already err ya
so had try lor try and walk err ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age ah then you look back at your at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food leh she
no she has um err high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now what right like
last time he got juggle his intake meh
exercise ah
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty mah like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
uh really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that one cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
mm
oh he cannot take because of this but he's fit what
ah okay okay
ya
wow okay that is quite sian cause like I see him exercise so much and err workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain one as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff lah because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar what so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know ah don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
oh shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first uh like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why wow there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but oh ya oh wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was err what's that called ah
with like I think is a vegetarian meal lah so like
no like err there's err you know like those kind that looks like mala but I don't think it's mala it looks like err it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in err healthy lifestyle err why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one err ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like eh bo jio
no when people when people jio you you not like you will reply what
ya
not you lah I mean like other people people alamak
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online lah it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary lah if you ah used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we err
err
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot err
aiya
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very sian because I miss it ugh
it is it's available but it's like ugh
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like aiya
ah yes it must not be cause otherwise
err so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black one can wear when we go out but then for the white one maybe wear to like wedding
err thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot ugh
err in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep mah
same
not not about options or design eh like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb ah
ya just
no lah it's not that it's not that jialat what
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years err if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one ah
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel lah if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
ha not so jialat like expand too much right err then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive one is like oh my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
oh let's go see err universal traveller the winter shop
I don't know where we can just go lah walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop
yes ah
huh
ha he wasn't even breathing yesterday ah ya and he said he's not sleeping but I have a feeling he slept what nonsense want to fix circulatory system
no dubai is in parkway east hospital since that time he was admitted he didn't
and he's like I I ah the parking for bike is free but I'm just worried they will clamp the bike thinking who park the bike for the end over there
will it be towed away
okay I'm gonna tell him
no I think the nurses know I think the doctor ask him the doctor say err are you confident to ride your bike then he's like maybe not I will take a cab home
ya ya so so so the doctor told him like ya you can take cab home from the hospital
this one need to clap clap for him cause he just like bring the bike and leave it there I don't know how long already
seriously
apparently the neck still pain eh he's like he said there's this weird feeling I'm like what is weird feeling it's like I don't know it's a bit weird I'm like huh but it's one week already and it's not even an invasive treatment why would your neck be aching more uh like one week after when it's just supposedly an injection
no that's the thing I don't know when is the follow up err follow up appointment the uh I don't know
anyway now he probably quite kanchiong no haven't kanchiong yet because he will only kanchiong like literally twelve hours before the exam he has two papers one on wednesday one on thursday
that's why he actually he very busy so that's why he say uh we go buy cake after your exam I'm like nope I'm gonna go but it today unless the cake don't have an ya if the cake don't have then I said sad okay lah then we we we buy another time
I am looking forward to T box I want beef
is it nice have you eaten there
oh wait I thought your sister went to eat before
because at bedok
ya so it it's a
no cause I see people posting the food it's like the stone grill beef so it looks very good it's like ya
really orh
oh last year
no oh ya and also the the other one the six six five
ya that was october ya
ya
I think ah everybody must be crazily booking all the tourist attraction now because of the kids who are all stuck at home and you cannot
is the is your sister one of those kiasu people who book way in advance
advance what
but she never book like staycay or anything meh usually if she cannot travel she will staycay what
expensive leh I tried checking for new year eve the staycay is expensive
ya
but I thought this year don't have they only have uh neighbourhood fireworks
ya it's like you staycay in town to have fireworks in the neighbourhood it's quite
really but cannot see fireworks what from orchard
ah ya lah but you know like
crazy siao like the the there there's this err new hotel called laguna work err it's a golf club lah so it's new
uh near EXPO like somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club ah ah err so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever lah and err
what's that called
but this one six hundred golf club also got no view okay lah
eh but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called ah changi city point
ya
no it's a is it hotel ya gold club ah ya like resort ah
why as in
uh ya
please lah crowne plaza changi is four hundred fifty for normal room
uh ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice leh but like aiya I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong one they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia one and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard one lah a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use err they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it lah
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not lah
eh I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open err an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever lah wherever
ya but once we once okay lah not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
ah okay lah not immediately maybe you have to wait until like err I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so leh they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't um like if you don't get tested then okay lah basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I ah you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in lah like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day pedi said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free what to watch so like they um what's that called they were saying like err please do not travel and to minimise the spread ah the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at err it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are kiasu usually err kiasu kiasi don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined what not meh
chey they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail meh like no no jail like
aiya whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india one ah
no but look at
isn't it like err what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small what even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five what
so you wear mask at all times at your table
ah that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like huh but we one person what what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone lah I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest never mind lah
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that one
eh the the the khatib new err playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
khatib SAFRA ah ya the one uh jason went the the
HomeTeam khatib HomeTeam at khatib I told you before
uh ya but uh maybe not not when uh got menses
okay that one ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
err okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different lah I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like oh you're so caring I'm like what the hell
err
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite kaypoh what no meh
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy anas
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game what
who is asking who like the
orh it works both ways
no what that's why if both parties have to have their own ah
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
ah ah
ah
ah
okay
orh ya lah
okay
that is like what okay err
eh but surprisingly leh the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
ah
ya
ah
ya
huh
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad leh I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play lah we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van ah
he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible what like it will be unstable so like
ya lah you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is lah
ya
it's like oh I schedule a pap smear
I think in december I don't remember and also like err what's that thing called ah
flu jab
why ah
oh are they gonna rip me apart
oh
huh
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again kan when you think about it kan err
I think
I I think
err you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch it ah
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that one government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
err oh my god
ya the older people all have lah
oh ya ya the fibroid
right and then after that I'm like
ah
ya ah
everybody thinks like oh this person single mum is it
ya
siao lah
a spotify or
ah
ya
eh I talking about this um
I don't know whether I told you but err so like uh I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay lah but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
huh
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
ee but then it has no rubber at the side
ya
so it's like
oh no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
err ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
catch ball
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm

uh huh
ah
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
oh okay okay
mm
okay
okay
let go ah
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying ah you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly what okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay ah
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength ah ya ya ya
oh but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career lah it's more of like uh okay okay not not so much of a mistake lah not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
ah
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
ah
okay
ah
mm
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
oh
a'ah
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
mm
okay
this was when ah
how you afford all these things man operation lah go lah
you loan ah
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
oi okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room ah
but you're
ya
ah who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
eh that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know ah it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no ah
just a cross ah oh okay
no you know why because I don't know lah it depends on my future lah because for now there's a lot of changes ah okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
dubai right dubai airline is it
oh
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience ah
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that lah
ah
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

so what did you do in school
okay you can talk in english you know
ya it's just a mix
mmhmm and then
what module was it
do you like it
companies sustainability what is that
mm
oh that's interesting well at least you're learning something that you can apply I guess
I mean what can I do with engineering
yay where did you go
no but the fact that you guys celebrate like monthsaries
when was when was the last time I celebrated my monthsary mm
last time we didn't even celebrate I mean okay ever since
after our anniversary like me and mirza
how was my day mm today
it it's just consultation I didn't know that it's
an optional class so basically I just went all the way to ngee ann for nothing
oh my goodness I'm so sorry but I hate how ngee ann is being placed
like
that is so tragic like that school is so tragic
it's so far oh my god the walking distance I mean singapore poly wasn't even that far
it's just right in front
I ate ramen
with my uni friend cheryl her name she very nice err
we ate ramen at the beauty world food centre it's so good
it was only seven dollars and it was a
it was um big bowl
so basically like they had free upsize for ramen and it's only seven dollars and like you'll get a whole big ass bowl of ramen it's so good you need to go there
err when I came home I went to watch Netflix this movie oh my god kristina you need to watch this movie it's so funny it's called night school

how much was one cake one cheesecake
forty five dollars for two cheesecake actually it's not bad eh is it only these two flavours
oh got what flavours
mm okay
anniversary
you just celebrated your fifth monthsary
one hour we need to talk
ya
okay I have some interesting questions about you so is like um like some question prompts ah that they came up with
so like this question
um
what is the one thing that you wish was free
what do you wish like
what could be something that that you wish was like something that you you cannot like pay with money
why
oh my god period
uh huh
do you feel like your expenses mostly
you will take that
okay I have to agree with you on that one I feel like
um clothes is unnecessary honestly
ya but food anything that you need to survive basically food
water shelter
yes
I agree okay then another one they ask
what is the pettiest reason that you dislike
that you would dislike someone pettiest reason mine is I cannot
like action know it all
like I think that is a pet peeve for me
an instant turn off ah basically or a different mindset than me ya
but I'm open to to educate them you know what I mean
if they're open also lah it goes both ways
okay you
boundaries
people
err lays
oh yes
oh ya ya ya mm
ya ya
action lah
ya okay
no he had to sleep early today
um
ya both our two boyfriends are in army right now enlisting
okay what
okay um
I feel like okay personally there won't be any of this
like buildings technology gadgets all of this nothing
it's true right we won't have anything if you think about it we're all that people are just working to just build all of this
so what will we do
what humans will do
I think we'll just rot eh
okay
ya there's no system lah for them to
ya
they just don't understand the value
it actually ya disciplines us lah in a way
mm
ah I think that's yes
hey
hey
the other flavour
you lying I thought there is akmal
oh girl
so there's a lot of malay guys
ya that's the thing about guys you know like they
because I'm in engineering course for the past few years then I noticed like guys
they rather be hanging out with like you know their own species like guys ya ya
like
I mean honestly okay if you are
if
like if okay if it's if it's female dominated would you like um include the guy in your group yes right

I think I told you like I missed it
like it was yesterday I thought it was today apparently I booked on the wrong day so
yesterday I didn't go so I missed it so now I need to wait for nineteenth december
to take that theory test
ya that's the thing I have to wait until nineteenth december to take that test before I can book my which

a good body for certain reasons
if you
were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
oh period
why you copy me
I won't get it I will just stick to mala
so everyday you're eating like different
ingredients but still the same base
I like I like I want to try mexican food though
like authentic ones
my friends in school like now school
like I've been talking to
like some of them like
having daily conversations with them on Whatsapp
he's twenty four this year so basically like he went to the he like he went he went to the route lah
so his life is basically like just moving around you know like
he lived in um abu dhabi then he came back in singapore he lived like multiple
houses in like through singapore like from the west to the east to the north
ya
then now
you know his his life is just so interesting because he
he does a lot of things and he was from then he keep he keeps telling us about like his stories
ya I told you before like he's the he's pretty short for a guy then after that like
tease him
ya and no the thing is that he was telling us the whole story then like you know guys being guys
like
but for him I feel like
he's more of a emotional kind of like softy ah I would say
ya he's a nice guy
then um I
mm
that one zul then I have like this study group
um there's
there's a total of six of us four four guys then two girls
like me and the cheryl girl lah then the the guys
one is one is a mix of japanese indian
but he knows how you talk in malay like
damn good damn fluent
then I ask him at first like eh you sure you not malay ah cause he looks like malay also
like from from my first impression then he say no
I I chinese indian japanese I
like
he's so ya but
sad lah because the the parents divorce so like he didn't really get to
mingle
what
green
what happened to it
thank you I want Nalgene please
ya because that that bottle
that bottle is basically a Nalgene
no I don't care it's only ten dollars
aww
so who's water bottle are you going to borrow now
exactly that was your water bottle
what happened to the pink Nalgene ah it's missing also
ya the hot pink was mine
mm
oh then one of my guy friends like
he very funny ah but like suddenly he
he said guys I'm tired of this
err life he he was talking to us like face to face ah like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say wah I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
oh my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like wah I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay lah he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with lah
but
let it go just like that
so wasted lah
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts right now
in so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules um module grades are based on how they perform lah
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
whose that
waalaikumusalam
sasun you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that what
oh it's not a stereotype ah it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial oh my god you know
oh my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments ah basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just oh my god
like because err one of my group member
like he action do
but in reality he doesn't know lah but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else lah to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring ah like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement what
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
oh my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing uh the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya
that's part of engineering
to what colour
no at this point my hair is dying
no I just don't want to
like you know now is already dry
don't you feel like when you're when you're
when your hair is coloured like it's very fragile
dye your hair no you liar
so there was something lah
do you regret
if I were to dye my hair
I'd dye
I want green man
there's just something about green
depends on what shades though
oh that bright one ah I prefer the
very is dark
but it's on a lighter shade
hmm
poor man
ya very often
I mean we don't really like celebrate it celebrate it
it's not that special of an occasion
what's that
mother dough
what do they sell croissants
is it like is it better than that tiong bahru bakery
how much
for one
pastry
mm
oh my god that looks so good
oo I love sourdough bread
oh I love that kind of pizza
handmade
how much is that
oh so cute
is it waived
mm pretty
coffee and how much was it
oh my god
that you sent me
mm ya
but not the recent ones
I saw it I sent to you I sent to you and it's I sent it to you I sent that video to you
no but the fact that they they keep those
tigers
well at least they're feeding them you know what I mean
but do you like to go to the zoo
my my boyfriend hates it hates it he he doesn't like it
ya
he's a man of his words
which is nice lah
oh my god
what he say
oh you're talking about
mmhmm
mmhmm
from their homes
old folks home
oh that's cute
but so err um
that's what I feel
but like all of them chinese is it
or is it a mix
you could have asked your chinese friends
okay what what what do you want the outcome to be just them doing TikTok and enjoy
but are foods provided
oh I get it I
think christmas eh
think it's pretty hard eh considering there's like no physical interaction
I mean it'll be it'll be more meaningful if there's physical interaction
aww
second
as his pet
that's so cute
why why why why why the sudden interest
so
what happened to the fish
so is that the only pet um pet he has
he miss his mummy lah
then what did he say
then now
hmm but he's so cute
no but he needs he needs to have a proper home so tomorrow he's going to buy
what
aww
how
and that's still small
like fun meh he doesn't get to interact you know with the pet
so he's going to bring the snail to the camp

he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more um what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so um he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of err
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
I mean he does have the face of like
oh my god when was the last time
mulan
is it
think so
err acting ah
err I'm re-watching friends over and over again can never stop man
okay documentary
I know I heard
okay so in your own opinion do you think that that it's actually a good way of

mmhmm
personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
um fridge

good share though will be interested to actually watch it on netflix
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
they will be tempted ah ya should shoplift in norway
what do you mean
uh ya
oh right right right
nice
ya then after that this year

things in your mind

like
mmhmm
ya
I know girl
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh you went dark so fast
ya
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
sis we all struggling here ah
at least we are doing something about it right
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
ya
ya so like err ya so like now I'm like
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your taiji lah basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year eh
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a err a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
err
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish lah so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants ah so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically lah
I think we both know that lah
ya so just tell me what you want lah so in a way communication works
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm mmhmm
okay mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya as long ah you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
oh damn
oh
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
wow
oh my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like err back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate ah if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
jer
okay
ah
uh on trump um surprisingly ah quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so err but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
orh
mm mm
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
ya ya ya
oh okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
orh okay
okay
but if you terminate
orh okay okay
oh
this is under adam or your own
I know that is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like um all his clients to invest in sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff um a lot of people will invest in that and
ah mmhmm
mmhmm
side
oh oh
oh
UNICEF ah
ah ah that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but um yes err in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus oh not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically err I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them eh so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it ah
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work lah
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
ah
its its definitely different lah cause um
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but um for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you lah
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
uh huh
a'ah
ah
ya then they will be screwed up ah which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
um I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
err there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
ugh its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
um in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country um
that's it ah december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
um mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something

oh my god the parking the parking can pay off my bike instalment babe I swear

are you serious
can transfer to other people or not
like ya sell your package to someone else
oh
why you still continue to pay sia babe
right
oh my god babe that's a lot of money sia
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put uh a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that oh because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
wah I will angry sia
ya
oh you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
err like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him lah he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like oh
just like
I think it's quite cute lah like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right um the last girlfriend ah he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like oh so like to him it means a lot lah that he ask me then I was like orh okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
um also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with hassan
me I still have unresolved issues with hassan
ya we're still not talking tau babe
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover wah I felt like the shittiest daughter ever sia babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like ah loose threads or like uh consequences on some like those aftermath of me and hassan that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with aqil and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with aqil I want to be with aqil only and not have like oh this is because of hassan that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about hassan like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so ah because like he was a great boyfriend sia babe only things things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year ah
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way sia babe like
like the thing with hassan all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet aqil and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time ah babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and aqil
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
ya I don't know ah like
I mean I really really hope hassan
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness ah babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship lah after that I don't know what happened
right
uh after after hassan
cause you were still with audi and then like we went out remember you me hassan you me hassan audi ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so eh babe
uh like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like um cold like he's very err like
ah very action ah
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like uh when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then err he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder ah like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out wah scary ah
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
ah
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
oh ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
huh
ah ah
oh right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
oh my god
bangkok is it
I think it's bangkok right
like
sorry
no lah I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go bali sia babe
no like bali is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
eh they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights lah you just have time for each other
just lepak with each other
oh my god they're gonna transcribe this
ya like typing it out like okay so miza um said she and aqil colon
oh right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then ah
ah ya the the they were in the lot and then like aqil saw them then aqil was like eh and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like err Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
huh
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
mm
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
firdaus is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce aqil to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like oh my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like aqil like morals also questionable
like he ah he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
mm
your mum
ya
eh how's your mum is she okay
err I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
uh
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him ah like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like oh no lah but like he wants to
then I say it's fine um like we can like plan lah like
try to understand and see other people's view ah like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with

eh true true
stop me from
pursuing it cause I think they also like know
I feel like
actually
you should not
limit yourself lah
you think you cannot fly
yes in order to succeed we have to fail first because we won't know
our mistake
in
mm
so my father say if he have to pay right then he gonna be bankrupt like he's just gonna be bankrupt
I think must pay a sum of ten K if I'm not wrong or like more than ten K
hundred K I don't know ah

two times
ya sia but if you become
possible
mm mm
better to
better to
ya
uh huh
ya
ya
ya true true true
mmhmm
true
ya
ya
true true true true
like I feel
like then I can execute it
I cannot be the one doing the critical thinking like
I don't think so my brain can
handle that much ya
even in I have already
I I I already sot imagine in freaking hospital
hmm
no no
ya
they have to be there for you lah to support you
if your friends like very like
what the heck like just mm wah shit lah then then don't don't don't bother
mm
correct two
it's like
we don't
we don't
push each other than the one person who was pushing the other person just left behind or whatever shit I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say but ya
K it's like for example
I cannot be there at the same level I cannot be at the same pace as you
I have I'll be lagging behind cause I'm pushing you
I cannot be
I cannot be standing beside you and push you
you reach the finishing you reach the finish line first I'll be at behind then who will be helping me you cannot pull my hand cause you at the finishing line already
ah
that's my analogy
ah
oh alamak
alamak sis
oh he cheat on you
ya true
uh uh sis
sis I think I can um diagnose your
um
err what depression level are you right at right now I think you are at stage three
um
stage three
you are still at the denial stage you don't want to accept it yet
unlike me I'm at stage five
eh
at stage three
um you
you K one the signs of you um being at stage three is because you still can't accept
the fact that he's far way behind eh far way in front of you already
ya
and then
ah then
wah you funny you again sis alamak sis
correct
he stage three depression but now he already you think he stage five now or he's still at stage three
or maybe at stage four
still at stage three ah
but actually no
cuddle but in the morning I don't need it wei I just throw it on the floor
ah
we are
we are all human beings we
we have to treat guys
nicely
I don't know sis
uh
but actually I actually you don't need to pause I only need to pause
why so dark sis your
room
ah no electricity
oh
oh yes sis my house at night really oh sis we left thirty second
a'ah sis
then we can continue the second part

err my day today was okay it was quite a slow day uh
because I didn't do much uh today
um I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work lah
I haven't actually applied for anything
err I was there was this err job link that adli sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
err
err annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly lah but then there was an addendum to the title
that said uh it was uh
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words ah
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
err natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with err and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually err learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then err
so
so ya lah the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
ah yes I will be part of that
a'ah
soon lah in a few days lah I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
err
so far no uh except for a few that I saw err
err wherever lah I think there's a few locations
no like err I I meet the requirements ya
mm
okay lah the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and err second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy uh
the best eh
probably second language learning
huh why
no uh because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory what so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
mm ya
your leave
mm
mmhmm
hmm
wait pause they made you take
a test
ah
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training eh
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya your boss's boss
ya
mmhmm
huh how come your computer shut down in the room
oh so the
so basically the zoom thing crash lah nothing wrong with your computer lah
okay okay good
whoa
okay uh
I sat in the chair
but it's okay lah I mean I managed to
err get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was err
that one maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want ah
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
ah
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift eh
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
so
so basically there was no person in charge lah for the thing
wah co in charge lah
on the ups
mmhmm
mmhmm
after six
oh okay
oh
oh okay okay
ya
hmm
so he's new
ah
mm
oh
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
eh to whoever's listening
confidential okay
mmhmm
the what thing
oh okay
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
mm err on the days you're schooling
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
you
oh you cannot request for shift change eh
oh for your class eh
eh I think I destroyed your chair
oh okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
mm
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
mm
ya
mm
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
mmhmm
oh shit serious ah
mm
ya
mmhmm
justin bieber
oh
oh they are not big fans of justin bieber
mm
have different workflows eh
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
oh ya lah
you better do it
ya
serious ah
mm
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit err
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you uh
the previous shift
complacent ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I don't know uh I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send uh
in what sense
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya
mm
wait
okay
mm
mm
a'ah
ya like you
mm
mm
oh ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
a'ah
mmhmm
ah
ah
jaded
mm
oh okay
I was actually going to make a joke
ah okay lah
mm
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
huh
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker eh
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more uh
malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know uh but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
kan it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine ah it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable lah
aiya
ah
a'ah sia
ah ya lah of course lah it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching um
err Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
err
err there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
ah ya
in japan
oh
but mm
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file ah
cloud
oh ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one ah
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands uh two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
err like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the kan the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
err
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
huh
I mean you have an eye for the frame what
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things uh like
behind ya that kind of shot ah
mm
A U T E U R eh
a'ah
auteur
ya
but
err anything ah can also uh
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
mm
okay ya
mm
oh to get ah ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and err location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological uh age not twist ah like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about ah
that looking into the
err
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay ah stimulating ah but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like um
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and err
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
err three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
err power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
err
let's see
ah the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
mm
ah
ah
ah
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
mm
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
mm
oh ya ya a'ah
mm
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail ah
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
oh ya that's okay okay we watched that one
we watched that one in the cinema uh
nevermind ah
I think that one will I probably will have to watch with rehan lights off speakers on
oh
mm
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it ah
eh I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography ah
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
ah
no you know no
no lah we do it we do it properly lah but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from err getting
uh machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
oh ya
no need ah low budget ah indie
live what
no lah it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no lah
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free lah
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
oh ya correct correct
okay lah then when we on our off day then we do ah
I think can can no worry can be done
oh ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon lah
like next year
uh my hot ah
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or what
ah whatever game you can try you try ah
mm you never try Borderland three
buy ah
for the for the release price lah the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday eh
what you buy
oh ya
oh ya later ah later
masks
yes
compress
okay lah
oh okay
huh
I want to I want to take one
nezuko
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation ah
ya lah so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the weeaboos it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the weeaboos go through
I think
mm
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic ah in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
oh no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
mm
uh haikyu is not that
mm
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
oregairu
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written ah
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season ah
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
mm
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works uh
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm
oh
mm
hmm
mm
J drama
mm
ah I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas eh
mmhmm
makeup
okay lah
decently young lah
oh
mm
mm
oh bullying eh
mm
ya
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mm
international
because there's a connection
mm
mm
mm ya
oh I mean jakarta is the city pe
oh okay
I think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
ah then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
oh okay
mm
oh okay
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
oh yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
mm
oh yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
mm
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of err child language development
ya I learnt that
ah
koreaboo
but oh ya the key caps
wah
ya then it was like seventeen like that
oh okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
huh
uh most of them use the same stems anyway lah

hi I'm okay
mmhmm
orh
all the way
oh wow
mm mm
mmhmm ya
oh wow
mm
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
hmm
err
and then they they said err depends ah ma'am depends I said huh
circuit breaker ya orh
mm mm
mm on that day itself ah orh okay okay
mm mm
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing seh it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job lah basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like uh mcdonald's then okay ya err like customer number one two three four and then they just say ah ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
mm
mm mm
mm
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business huh
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like huh
mm mm
oh my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
mm mm true lah
uh uh
mm mm
mm mm
huh
mm mm
thanks eh
ah maybe lah mm mm mm mm
so ang moh lah you know and then
ya but it's quite serious lah because I don't know
ah
mm eh
mm mm mm
orh
oh
mm mm okay okay
mm orh
mm mm
oh
oh my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
mm aedes correct ya
mm
most likely it is lah
mm mm mm mm
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat lah once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
mm correct correct
every other day sure got some story one
in the news both mm mm local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting sia I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like oh my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy mm mm mm mm mm
huh oh my god
so scary
oh my god
mm mm fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya lah that's true lah mm mm it's a bit more controlled lah ah
mm mm true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know mm mm
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden ah
ya definitely definitely
mm mm
ya that's true
mm mm
ya lah I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like err quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that oh my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know lah I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important seh
mm mm
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like walao like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about um you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes lah like you said so
mm mm ya lor that's why funny ah
mm mm almost half a year lah
mm mm
ya that's on transport food ya
mm mm ya lah ya lah correct
mm mm mm mm
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
mm mm
something that I don't know like
ya lah
correct correct correct or just do virtual lor everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything lah everything is now virtual lah like but it's quite actually interesting lah like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true mm mm
endless seh like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say lah they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
mm mm
mm mm
wah
funny ya
ya lah sometimes no choice is the best choice lah ha
mm mm
mm mm physical is no longer really needed lah ha
mm mm mm mm
ya lah but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
mm mm ya
ah wow amazing mm mm
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya lah mm mm
mm mm ya lah ya lah
mm mm cancelled kan oh postpone ah okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know lah I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
oh ya I think I saw that
mm mm
nature is healing ah mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
mm mm mm mm
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
mm mm mm
mm mm less is more
mm mm
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving what you know
mm mm
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it lah you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell lah oh okay mm mm hobby eh
mm mm ya that's true
ya lah must be positive lah because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done lah of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard ah
mm mm
I mean it's complaining is part of life lah you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
mm mm true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely kan uh uh
ya
mm mm
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see eh
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like mm
mm mm

it was okay lah um they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that err they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there jer siala what is my five year plan
err there's a position that opens up in a different department and um my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to ah
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay mm answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees ah sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like oh
but it gives me a very nice err
oh long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long oh they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can err I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like oh I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like eh so what you want do you for five years ah ah you know like you like you could say like huh five years ah wah I never really think about it eh and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also err
you also answer like oh never really think about it eh but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long lah but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer lah so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say ah oh ah I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee um so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve um more things
which is true I I think it's also like um I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that oh err in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K oh you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you eh I give you three point five lah you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic what so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different um setting it's all about how you make it um you make it work in the in in this stuff kan lah fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that um
I don't want to be too greedy lah like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale wah that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack ah but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right um about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
err
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say lah hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like wah you say this kind of things ah
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and err we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household lah but you know on an average
mm
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand wow
wow
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up lah I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel lah but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account eh there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically um
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't err I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say oh it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website err can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account eh you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting um this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
err it's the security

the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks

and then um
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes

so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes

do you have relatives any of your relatives in that platoon or something then she said no but they very passionate about it lah so they were critical of the government ah you know why that kind of thing
was so hard
floating voice

what issues they face
um when adhering to this err
this err err exercise programme ya

ya
so ya lor that's been like
err what's been taking up the most the most of my time for the past two weeks

orh
oh ya ya
then what he angry ah
a'ah
oh
oh ya ya
oh that's week three ah
orh
oh ya we have
the drive
clinical decision making
so that's like an assessment but that one quite fast like I also don't get why is it so fast ah they have so many groups to assess
oh but that one damn shag ah that one that one cause the previous assessment
me and darren never really do that well
so this one really have to buck up lah
then for
following the following week is
what ah week
week thirteen so that one is all the
is all the is all the one prac and one
and one paper
so that one also quite shag
uh ireland
no dude it's freaking
seven hours before us so now is three O three thirty so now there is
bro damn early sia
then like she say
a lot of us like tell her uh prof have a good rest
then she was like uh no uh I have class after this
then like bruh
ah ya no she
I mean
that also and like
and like wah she damn shag sia
like really ah but mad respect lah I think she's one of the better profs like
that this ya that ireland has to offer
like at least she like
explained her stuff compared to like all the other profs who like just give
and like you don't even know what they expect then this one she will specifically state like oh this thing that thing
ya
so which is good lah so we know what to expect
but sometimes she can be long-winded lah and repeat her stuff then that one like a bit sidetrack
err like midnight ah ya uh our midnight so it's like their five
around there ya
I mean it's not like their students staying up lah is
us
who are in a totally different time zone have to end up so they have to accommodate to us
wah shit then this weekend also like
then last weekend there was not football sia then
damn sian
ya
damn sian lah like okay but some of the scores were quite mad leh like the portugal one
ya sia
ah ya
wah sia you all
ya sia then just put jota up front what the heck
but man U also I don't know ah a bit on and off
like I watch also like doesn't feel like I want to be a man U supporter anymore
legit sia like that day I was I was watching the everton manchester game right
then like I thinking wah this one everton confirm win
and then everton lose then I what the heck
oh ya ya ya he tackle

oh tottenham man city will be sick oh liverpool leicester also
wah shit
how to set up my team like that sia
eh got play or not
why you never play sia

serious
but shah they all don't play meh terry they all
oh oh oh
you you stopped playing takraw also
hmm
dude there's a lot of kids at my neighbourhood just
gather ya not not just that like they play like there's group of seven or eight people then they just play badminton
play
takraw lah then like nobody care leh
I read like many it's it's like they don't give a shit lah
but then now now I feel like
singapore also quite stable lah so
you think will move into phase three or not
they say most likely before end of the year
so like
huh eighty per cent
of of what
oh then they will go into phase three
oh that's the incentive ah
sian
I mean just for that bit of freedom lah but then still need wear mask ah
ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life lah definitely
but I just hope like there comes a point in time whereby don't need wear mask
damn hard to breathe sia sometimes
especially on hot days
hmm
but then
what to do is like that lor
oh you want to go
ah ya lah then I think need wear mask also right
I think so definitely lah that is also true
oh but then got a lot of the
actually I also kinda miss ah
but they selling all the they selling all the equipment online
like ya
but that is quite expensive sia
but then again is all used lah so I think the price is even cheaper but then other people use already sia you want to use meh
ya sia that's why
but I also
huh
but I also want to go back sia
wah that will be that will be the dream sia
huh
wait why are you in police uniform
oh the ah
oh ya ah
deepavali eh isn't deepavali on the fourteenth
ah oh that is true
oh ya ya
so you deployed to
to little india ah orh
eh you get you are that division
I always thought you at the woodlands one
ah
oh okay I mean that's more convenient lah in my opinion ya easier mah
wah then that yesterday I also talked with adrian
about like you know adrian is in
oh err TransCom adrian lah
he also went for shooting the other day
ya then he says he's damn busy now
ya supposed to be this week
but then they I told them
so they say okay never mind can come another time then like oh okay ah then they I think they reschedule me for
january ah january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when ah early of eh
eleventh of jan I think
ah oh damn
okay lah hopefully lah cause
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay err thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
oh
maybe ah
orh
I mean that would make sense lah is earlier
ah
been awhile since I go there also sia
eh no lah last time I went was for
wah that one shaggy
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it err you so um one week
push-up all that right the person is
err standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count lor
but then err cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
err
there's no gauge for you when to
uh push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier lah but then
ya sia true
you got try at maju ah
ah maju the
maju is very the the machine
the the what ah the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run eh the
the
uh statics because is all automatic
err when I use then I wah
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like wah I never run this fast before sia
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been sia
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like wow
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it lah but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider maju lah
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
ah
ah ya ya same same like maju lah
I mean
okay lor
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
then silver is three hundred then the max is
the max is five hundred lah the gold
wah but I never hit gold before
only that time sia when we were in
everyday right
ya
ah
uh huzaini eh that day I saw ben though
ya the the one who
screw us up
ya

ah ya ya ya
I think so
I think
I think he's when he he got like C or something wah cui sia cause of that incident
but then
now he I think doing quite well ah
okay lah I think he took his job too seriously
but as a person outside I think he okay cause
uh he like
somewhat remembered me lah
then I just talk to him then
like I think he's studying at University of Buffalo

but I don't know why he was at though
it was like during the sports appreciation night

oops my bad oh marine parade east coast plan

then again I always see his story every time got different girl lah

safi was more for us
was there more
compared to gary ah gary was like
ah ya ya
no lah
qawi
we got we kena him once or twice ya ya ya
when gary was missing then like needed like a replacement so
it was him
it was him then sometimes got qawi also cause I think
uh who's this safi was close to qawi
ya
no what I thought like we got him like
middle of the way
and then
is it okay really sia I thought he was there for quite substantial period
oh ya the ending
oh ya ya
then the ending was like very little stuff to do already I remember we just ya if really nothing do we just sit at the door
and then
eh you all want play football or not
in the end did we even play
I don't recall playing sia at the shack
I just remember the
the sports day you you got play you played frisbee right

I I don't think he wanted it though
ya
hmm
in the end where he go ah
no no no uh isa
oh right ya ya ya
I always thinking I always thought it was command like not commanders like
but then that's nas karim
aqil umar ya
ya I think the four of them only but the four of them also I think were instructors
oh
oo
instructor ah
I always thought like what what would you be like if like
my experience was front line
cause I mean
I'm behind behind the scene a bit boring lah as in
okay lah lesser stress but then
no action also sian
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff
you
no lah siao why talk about
there was one lah but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
uh I think then it was at
marina stadium there ah then what they did was what I had to do was err
I just accompany them on the boat
and then just
do towards lor
wait I don't know what's this I forget already but then
I think home team show then they then all the people they just come onto
the boat
then they the my all the regulars
show them around make them
ya that was okay lah but then
I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do
okay lah
fudge
plaster
that was like legit like ninety percent of the time sia plaster
ya
eh then later what movie you all watching
orh that's the free ticket one you all got ah
eh I thought you had one extra ticket
or is that xavier
so you you xavier maria
who's joel
oh volleyball joel ah
oh at dhoby
oh ya that's true ah okay
what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about sia
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like wow this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any manga before sia
got recommends
oh the comics but why you read sia
no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good sia
but that's
black panther eh
ah ya black widow I think
end of the year ah
the
the whole marvel scene
who fuck sia
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
orh
no
orh
but now what he doing sia
is it
oh ya
after
I see serious
orh
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions lah
that's what he don't have
ya sia that one wah that one shiok eh
but
coney island ah
is literally coney island group
okay lah then we got one more year you want you want
eh no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
huh no ah
I mean
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
oh ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and hasif got the gazelles team
the hasif
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool eh and
but sad lah like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked imran lah like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun lah
I miss playing football sia
why sia
orh
is the clutch game ah
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers lah then
then I think hasif just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya lah quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
and it's just play amongst themselves and me lah so is like
unfair to others lah so I think they decided to leave
but that one safi jio
so then they stayed for long they were good lah but then ya just selfish lor
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play sia
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then uh I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
err think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then wah I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged lor
but by then they all would have played at right
wah shiok sia wah shiok
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time lah before before like
before
year two okay lah year two was fun lah
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky lah they get to travel that one
ya not bad ah
ya ya
bo pian lah so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised sia like their
they quite
not say backwards lah but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old lah
ya maybe ya cause that one was up a mountain leh
but it was quite cool lah then
try soba then the
err we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go dublin right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good lah so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan ah
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya ah
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure oh ya that is true
ya sia ya sia
how you got learn ah
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule ah
orh
wah sounds tough sia
I do err during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also pandan cake
err what other cake
err was it
butter
honey pound ah ya but then like
and all my like asked me like eh why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored ah
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress lor cause I think that period was also like exam period
ya then
ya lor that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell lah
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic lah having that like time to myself also
oh ya that's true lah that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype leh
you me no you did
oh ya ya chloe kept on trying lah I think dekai also kept on trying
oh ya lah
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why sia
because there was that time when err
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself lah for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up sia then I eat right I can still the taste the flour eh
ya maybe ah probably probably
wah but that one whole week was quite
shiok ah having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right wah is actually
ya
but the
ah ya you use what
mmhmm
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with fifi
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make err the mushroom more meaty ah
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill ah
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like err
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
err take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside mah
then after that he will
he will take
oh what he do after that ah oh ya then he will take
err like this
press it then
err so you will take out all the moisture wah then we make
we use that to make like cream pasta wah damn nice sia
actually next time right if like after all this
like if can go each other house then
you all can come then we can try to make it together
ya
I feel like cooking also
ya ya ya it's just like how you
oh right right right
ya cause nowadays also sometimes my mum will fast
so like I think
which days ah which days normally fast ah mondays ah I think
then like she will tell me okay help me taste because I fasting
then like okay
ya then I agree with you lah like
cooking really on feel one like
no matter like even the recipe said state like like this like this like this right but end of the day right I think feel
or like the passion
for cooking is more important
oh ya that is true
the you know the the ya ya ya that one
my dad also ah so
that's been that's been what what they
been doing ever since retirement ah of if the
the show I don't know if you know no no no

just need to cope well I guess and manage time since you're working als
test um
so I guess you
your design course is more into like you know assignments and project I gues
mm
but even during like they call it circuit breaker or something but I eh even had to come back during the circuit breaker cause like the err the experiment I was doing was really like ongoing ah and it has to be complete
mm I need to do something in life you know lik
further my studies not and and not just like you know work and there's more things for me to lear
ho

because I can still work and earn money to support for myself so that I can pay my school fees while completing my studies mm but I guess I'll be like you ah uh working while studying is gonna be very tiring and I'm kind of concerne
how am I going to manage my time but it's okay I need that degre
um
oh ya COVID we didn't have a chance to go outside becaus
I mean like for this current situation right now you can still go out with friends ah but to like limited places and with limited amount of people I think the max is like five people or somethin
like there's lesser option for you to lik
mm choose from I gues
mm
bu
if you really want to go staycation err you need to tell me earlier so I can like plan my schedule and take leave
mm
all I can say was that I remember the bed being comfy and I mean even there if there's like no pool right we can just chill and watch netflix and you know have food take away then we can eat at the hote
they actually having promotion where like I think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh
and you are paid seventy five dollars per adult and the good thing about that promotion is that you can have access to all the facilities ah mean you can go like if you like water activities we can go do some kind of lik
don't know the pedal thingy I don't know what you call that or we can just hang out by the poo
kno
mm err I mean like if really cannot find a like we really cannot go to shangri la there's other affordable hotels I guess if I'm not wrong you can use th
website agoda or something where you can find like a day hotel for you to hang out with my friend usually use that lah for like to surprise them for like birthday or something they always do that and mm
what else eh
waitress waiter if I'm not wron
take you out for dinner or something you can jus

okay I hope sial I hope it's alright
ya it's like that lah
um
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya lah because honestly he like how to say say uh he says like back then like oh we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act lah not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating lah even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels eh no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
haiya you know I don't know lah
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks lah it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up lah to shut up okay
shut up lah
just shut
okay
anyway err oh ah did you get your polling station place that you assigned to for the job

there's so like there's different there's different
what do you call it different
I guess like dude
I said start elite
difference different how you say different models different
ah ah a bigger sample group ya a biggest sample group will make for a more effective
study ah whatever lah
you don't have to I know you're you're trying you're trying to copy when I say saying something singlish
there you can say it yourself what
oh what did you eat today
you buy the bee hoon or did you cook
your mother
I woke up today I didn't even eat
err I woke up and then I eat at seven o'clock
ya
so I only had like one meal today
ya man
I think tomorrow I'm supposed to go out tomorrow is sunday right eh no today's friday
sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and menaz
I can't be bothered lah
no uh the part with adela I'm just like
uh you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I uh I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
wow
the ah I already told you what that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like oh I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
eh you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no ah you're not lah
that's why I don't say all girls are trash ah like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting sial
like she keep saying about
um she keep telling telling us like oh I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me err clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's um
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable lah
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no lah uh when the girl's the exception they say uh no lah she's just the exception exception like
like eh enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no lah she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
uh it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also what like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms
what
ya you see afiq now he wishes if he he doesn't have a boyfriend uh girlfriend
ah I I I I hope that they can resolve their issues
ASAP
but ya rashal's like keep asking me to go meet and then I'm like I don't know whether I can
actually I said okay how about tomorrow then I was like I don't know because by right I have the meeting what the filming for
so
they they also never update us about the situation but I think as of now like got nothing there's no venue
you're not allowed to
huh
no way I
wait they didn't tell me anything
wait if that
that means they won't have the
the materials
ah I check after
after this lah
I don't want to make extra tippy tapper tippy tap noise ya tippy tap noises
that's why so maybe she wants to talk about it I don't know
a'ah maybe
no lah no lah I don't think so also lah but I don't think I don't think so lah like I didn't think you I didn't even think she wanted to talk about it until you you mentioned about the filming
who's asking to meet you also
oh what was I going to say ah oh ya she wanted to invite syakif also syakif and irfan to come
dude ugh uh ah ya azuleen azuleen over
what's your
what's your ya it's it's so it's so dead nobody knows I don't know
what
you're not what you're not you're just jealous of us
you wish you had you wish your group was this hype
no you you just think because you see from the outside you like eww but then I bet I bet if you were like inside the group if you confirm like oh ya azuleen is the best I like I like
you're just jealous bro okay I'm not the
I I might I might end up um going
I just because they are like very on so I just might end up just going east coast park with them and cycle with them
cause the rest all useless
no they're supposed no they're supposed to help me ya like okay then they're like no it no it's not it's not okay cause I need to know
when there are free like if you tell me a date like you know how how like if I if I suggest something then let's say like
everybody say okay then the one person who didn't reply suddenly say oh I cannot on this day then why you never tell me in the first place
who says like whatever you can just message me it's like
there's like no no no
then err that's why I just like just leave it lah never
I never go plan lah I just like ah whatever lah you all don't want to go then I also don't want to go uh I go with somebody else
you know did syazwana what
okay lah I don't know I don't even oh ah actually you know I don't even I don't even like
really like vibe with them like you know like vibe vibe with them
but at this at this rate I'm just like whatever I'll just like do it lah
whatever it is I'll just try
oh I might not you know I'll just like
basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the the one hour
why does it feel why does it feel so much harder to like talk about
ya
or we can sing another thing we can sing okay lah sing oh no it's not singlish what if we sing
we are
okay then
are you kidding me
are you kidding me she has five bikes from who from where
oh my god dude I will go with faz and you
and afiq okay forget about amar okay if amar don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he
when I talk about the food then he want to go
so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring jurong jurong west bikes all five of them to
west coast has uh is there any does it have a good cycling
because I know one is very good
are you mad
I I don't I don't mind lah but I haven't exercised in so long I think I can pass away
I scared like one as I I just one the like the chances of
one out of the five of us probably will have like
hey guys I cannot already
you know ah west coast west coast east coast is
it's going to take a whole day you know
um
I want I want I want I want I want I want to go I want to go
okay then I just ask afiq
that
but does
does fazirah want amar to come
okay so so if anything just four of us ah
huh really ah
really
I don't want I don't want
I know but
is not huh
how do I put it
I wouldn't be comfortable
like like like okay I'm sure he's a he's a nice dude and stuff but
not like I don't not like him just that
it'll be more awkward and I'll have to like
ya
okay lah
you all somebody has to plan it's always like
it's always like when somebody says something like I want to go here then everybody is like oh ya ya okay I ons I ons everybody ons then nobody plan
it's not my bike so faz has to plan it
ya
I don't know member of parliament general election
was it I don't know I anyhow only
I don't know what's that
ya I'm not sure I'm in a group yet
mine mine when I message the person she said
uh I'll be added to the group
on
monday
I think
I'm not sure
maybe
but I already got my location
ya
oh I got my dates on eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten ah
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
err election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths lah the voting booths
ya she told me cause she she she also does the
does the she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
eh hello
of course lah
err no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
eh I feel really good about liverpool ah about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck ah
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically uh you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two what
so
you try to
collect the most points
err then the most points win lah win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically uh mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
err point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early lah so so to speak
it's it's fair lah as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good lah
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
err but you still have the remaining matches what
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
eh wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four oh my god not thirty ah forget ah forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so oh my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams ah or some or forty or twenty teams ah twenty plus teams lah not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided what
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay uh right now it's like fifty four
err
mm uh
oh
sempurna dan
okay what is sentence in malay
ah
ya then
um
berbual dalam bahasa melayu yang baku
like it's like compartmentalized already my brain like if I speak
like formal malay like no english words will accidentally go in but if I speak like
slang malay like accidentally english words you just go inside
like unconsciously
I think I know what you speak malay I speak english
is or or we can can we even do that
is it is it alright like
but they said
err speak in full sentences
of malay
as in you are speaking full sentences
what do you mean by you make a lot of some
you know what forget it let's just stop speaking speaking in malay anymore

I think we can just end it lah ah
okay press the red button okay ya on the count of one on one okay like just now okay three two one

okay I'm in
ya
ya
ya ya
how many people
wow
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
mmhmm
I think
they are
ya
ya
ya it's not basically is minuscule
I don't know
that's good man
that's good
ya I think so
so what next week starts ah
no
mm
ya ya ya ya
uh your skills your skill set and your experience kan
ya
the phase three ya
should be end jan
ah
you mean this this christmas coming now
okay
ya uh
okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya
mm
mm
would you be able to do that
ya
different things to do ah
ya
too tired
eh
feed her feed her
mm
mm
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
kan
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
err and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no lah fosterer no
what
ya uh yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic ah they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say oh the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say eh your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay lor
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the uh but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
ah G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish lah cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way lah you know ah in fact I was just talking about it to uh to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing kan
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean kan it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish lah what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in pasir ris why because pasir ris you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no pasir ris farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to tengah now they are all in tengah now the animal welfare groups so they are developing pasir ris that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible uh to all residents who are going to panic
ah
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
oh wow
ah
oh they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is um is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again uh so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute kan
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya aww
is it oh so sweet
ya
aww bless her aww ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment lah
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you kena fine lah or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
uh okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home kan
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear lah some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough lah you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering lah I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering lah
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it uh we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no lah maybe not here lah but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good lah to remind people you know kind of like that kan
ah
oh my goodness
they are copy cats
ya lah that's called district cats lah they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
mm
ya
ah
ah ya
eh
mm
because so much traffic eh
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm ya
but it's quite safe what this this tree
traffic
uh ya
ah
okay
ya
ah
ya
back to their refuge lah
people who work there know where these fellas go uh their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way oh then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
uh so funny and it's true right they would go almost every uh almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where ah the drains ah does it go to I don't know uh so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but uh it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
uh so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules uh I guess you know the the otter felt safe lah
oh
you know there are a few families ah apparently
otter
there is a fan club ah
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club lah
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know oh this is the kallang clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory oh then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not kallang so that is the one so they have different families lah all clans
maybe another clan huh
ah ah so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
um when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say kallang clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks ah this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves lah I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook aiyo so sad ah I think that was one was near uh
uh one of the um
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news lah okay so what I remember in the news
um
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove um they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far um the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts lah
one of their hangouts you know ah
ya ya ya
wah the otters right
cute right
ya uh
eh cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no uh unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like uh in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say oh this the the the kallang clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like wow bloody hell how do they know I guess they know lah they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type lah but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the ulars maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay lah let's put it this way lah shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction tau
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no lah they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
ah then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release lah
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again

and this is wafaidil
pretty good you know and it's uh it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family uh spending I just spend today at the beach in sentosa and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study err this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you hady what have you done for this weekend
um personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant lah I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless ah
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill lah looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
um one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand ah for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
um in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us ah cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it ah it's always err prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like ah fighting off against the heat ah and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
okay my
um me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid lah and
me as being someone very err
very err
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free ah cause I didn't ask to be born with err bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on ah for you know countries like switzerland providing eh countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their um their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also err adopt that err value of err taking care of their people's health lah
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
err we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question hady um
it may be seem out of context but um if you could have one superpower what would it be
mm after much consideration of like
ah me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think ah do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind lah through through their eyes lah basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard eh hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark ah and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
err back to you hady
you can just listen from afar right
hmm
ya yes of course you know err
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to err give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind lah cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya lah
ah
where you see something once
um this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be hmm I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking ah cause
err food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
err ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me lah to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my ah
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
err I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
err
I'm err I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household err and um
somewhat lacking in the social department lah cause
err it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
err
we just uh interested in different things lah
so that's just me and my err life relations lah
you know
hmm me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated lah cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single ah intricate detail of like
explosions um err hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
um if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables ah cause
err
nearly all my favourite actors ah actors and actresses are in there my idol
err there's also
err people like
err rocky ah
ah he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie ah
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance ah
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
um diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
ah the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions lah of
in a love lah
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush ah
mister johnny depp he has a very err mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie ah I would say
err but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his err former wife eh ah by amber heard
it's kind of sad lah I just wish him the best ah
you
hmm so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps oo because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar ah I relate to um my johnny depp cause you know
well
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters ah eh small horses ah
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea ah
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school ah
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea ah and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and ah another item I would say is probably
hmm
probably a note to myself from the past err you know lah
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know lah like what's your future self
err you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing ah basically a reality check from the past ah
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more lah cause
ah as for you hady what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste ah putting a note together
take ah
you want me ah one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes ah
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars ah people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me ah
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
um like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
ah I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time ah
of course err
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
err ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert lah
um me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes ah and
uh I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things ah that
I would wish for ah
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you hady
what would you wish for
um those are very good wishes ah your first wish makes me err seems like a very stingy person and selfish ah cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself ah
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that ah cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone ah so if you could
I would suggest you err be the owner of liverpool instead ah
fair enough ah
oh that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat nasi lemak
cause
uh actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
the remainder of my life ah
probably nasi ayam penyet ah
it literally has all components I need ah
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
ah there's always cucumber which is good
err of course lah the primary part ah
of course lah the
um primary part
of the dish of nasi ayam penyet which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body ah
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so hady if you could eat one dish what will you eat
hmm
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
I would want to be a
err I would want to run my own radio like um
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to lah cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to um
err prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch ah they very humorous
and
that ah that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
ah started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
wow
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
um another job that I would be
probably the law law sector ah
err
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment ah
that give him the proper um
punishment
they can be bought off ah
err you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense ah
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize lah
justice ah over anything
and for my third job ah
honestly I would want something social lah
so perhaps
err
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know lah cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
err err a hobby of mine which I like ah cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently ah so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly lah if the people macam
you can learn
how to deal
back to you hady
hmm
for me personally
from what I've seen ah
eh
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body ah cause
err I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
err I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
you know
um
um
good looks over that one ah
cause they also keep in mind that they want
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them ah easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
that's what they say ah how about you hady what you think
there there's no point if you have good looks
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality oo then that's what I would choose lah primarily ya stick to good looks lah
okay err passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it ah so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind ah um kind ah does a heavy toll on us ah
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
they just avoided ah like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
err raising awareness lah I would say err to this type of issue ah back to you hady
oh
hmm ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya err okay time to turn err time to turn to happier pastures ah from this depressing err fix err
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
um
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport lah
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of err electrical buses
very green ah
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide err you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course hady we talked about certain questions and

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet ah sorry ah for the wait
so like
ya what what were you doing ah meanwhile
ya ya ya ya oh ya it's sedap mania oh cheap ah really got what flavors over there I feel like going there again tonight leh
oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting
oh eleven to fifteen december
so ya segway so we segway for one hour
basic ah seh
ya original price eighty nine dollars
or one mega jump then
err actually we can do the also lah the is ten token
you know it's not bad ah usual price twenty two dollars
eh actually this one better if you want we should go for the sea aquarium tour ten token then the other ten we go mega bounce lor
ya more better than one hour jer
yup yup
ya bike got a lot of things lah then maybe you know sit somewhere carry marrybrown if you wanna
or marrybrown or or or we can just go ce la vi eat aspirasi mah
we can go the ce la vi hawker centre eat the aspirasi
so we can just ya we can just probably do that lor
so oh my god
um
ya two o'clock
oh okay lah actually we plan for three so two is a buffer time
I am not sure but okay lah even if we okay let's say we meet at three

I guess that's a need lah not a wish
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded kan it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do kan
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and err where you watch people eat
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited one
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now err
for your suit jer
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy one ah
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K lah faster lah you order for me and then you order for safi also lah
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series lah kan
then I just pass it off as spider cat ah
the one that you say oh black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday oh ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch lah
the thing is I don't know whether I ah actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
ah I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
oh gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave kan maybe I just take this friday lor next tuesday is for its for appointment what
wah I don't get it seh how did you even accumulate fourteen days eh oh ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
wow what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
oh
during his first year birthday eh wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the EX1>bangla< paid
aiyo I'm just thinking
okay lah no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
then the is the end product nice
no I mean like dan house
you can just ask what
like that

not hot pink lah like the like the lighter one like a bit more pale
the app no lah that one champagne gold lah ya ya ya correct correct correct ah like that
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part ah change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that one no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book eh
gosh
h
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need kan
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop kan is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
camera our phone cannot set raw kan raw image file
what iphone can ah
four A is small kan
aiyo
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
oh
so in the end you pick up what time
oh
sensitive eh
it's okay ah
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
eh sia lah
why ah
oh right right right um I remember um they asked me to rate that time ya rate your delivery person
oh right right right ah I remember err they ask me to rate that time your rate your delivery person
oh
I don't know some people they they always say err you always have room for improvement so they always give four point five I'm like what the heck tell me ah where is the room then they always like oh you know we cannot give perfect score because you know we must leave some room for us maybe that's why I know I know
huh
beat it ah
beat it ah
I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time ah
it's harder to
is because of the figure of eight
crank course not crank course lah plank
the crank course is ninety degrees kan its like U-turn lah
no I thought that one only for the first lesson only
only the first lesson kan I don't know lah I'm just thinking whether I should take class two a
drink this water or not
from last week lah that I am that's okay what it's just water
huh what do you mean
doesn't correspond with the job ah
huh
ya how much how much did he did he quote
um
right
ya lah
okay but that that is not her problem what is the deal ya is the deal between the father and ya you guys what like he has no right to intercept what who told him
there is another company if you all want to consider ah it's quite easy video ya work not bad lah but maybe the okay but you also not going to stay there but if you want to do them a favour you can check it no but will will will you will you even like speak to them about the like if they need any video
eh is it because of the the payment the changes oh that sucks
serious compensation as in like discounted lah oh my god and is already like at the low you all only you all choose the lowest lowest vendor get the most out of the smallest budget
I see that lady that is going away she is stepping down again
wow so this event is to commemorate her stepping down lah what oh the the election
moment ah
right
fourteen upcoming members as in new members
new and existing I don't understand what do you mean total is fourteen so now you have how many oh
wah so actually I want to know what's the criteria for you to become a board member
I mean you must have you must be earning some form of money because she is a board member right
see that's why I want to know because if you are a working staff you don't qualify to be a board member already what
right
the broth
tayoh
it's very everything is important you know when they say like oh everything is urgent
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then they will be like oh can lah shah you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya sia really I always give this kind of then they will say shan stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh

ah it wasn't
oh
I know it was a big thing in singapore ah but it's just for what because we were

it looks a like flu ah like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
kan kan

kan
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though

no
okay I close this one then close
oh no
no so it's all for nots
but
shazam
okay now it's
better
okay
okay now it's better
I think it's too loud
okay let's try now
I thought it is okay
something is wrong
ishak that one is fashion
err
actually this fauzi salleh was just doing the
fauzi salleh
he's
on blue
who is like forty plus senior
ya ya ya
err
and wedding
okay ah eh
maybe my order is confirmed
now it's much better the sound is much controlled
but now it's turning red
okay I ask thomas
don't start the chat
thomas
tom
did you manage to get into the room
no that's yours
but the no but now it's okay already
the lines are within reach
it's too much white noise
it was right
specifically in hawaii no lah hawaii taxes are four percent
oh
oh I should google that
oh ya true
oh that now recording
okay we have to do this voice recording
why
it's quite easy to code switch I think I've never realise it so it's not that difficult
check bank

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

alright err what were we talking about singapore social right ya

in your state but
um I would have been fine I would have been fine with it lah
provided you didn't do all sorts for your nonsense all sorts of your nonsense lah which
I'm not going to disclose I'm not going to disclose lah that's why I
then err
I think
err I'm fine with everybody it's just that I cannot get along right with I cannot get along with

I really really don't that
I really really don't like
so
ya lor actually in all honesty ah I kind I kind of hate everybody ah
I kind of hate everybody

more than I hate myself
is a very interesting character is one in a million diamond in the rough
should tell her that ah
tell her that
you have any other hot friends
yes I'm very I'm I'm very very I'm for life
or am I
I don't know I'm I'm I'm regretting all my time in right now
no
actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened ah
like you know
is most of them right that make the news ah is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then err
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then err but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago ah
because I sleep in school
so uh and
my friends they also know they also know this ah
most of the it's
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no lah but
no lah but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
err most of the
err most of the incidents takes err take place in ah
whereas the places where I
patron right err
the toilets where I go to ah they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they uh most of them
err some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge ah
I'm not too sure about this lah I can't confirm but
there are some right where
err
I think this one also depends on the price of your accommodation ah
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
so
err
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually err took I still remember you err he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered ah so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
err
you know that like single floor toilet ah
it's just a
it commune toilet ah communal toilet ah that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why lah people
err those pervs right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense ah
um there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to uh err
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame ah err that's lame lah uh I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
uh for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you ah
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then err like or hall activities ah like
yay sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey ah it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time err
err they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts ah
so they had I swear to you ah it was really cringey
err they had those like err orientation games ah then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they uh like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey lah
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me lah ah probably it probably is lah just me but
until now I still don't get
err
I don't get the concept of hype beast
I don't understand the concept of hype beast
err last time it used to be
the trend is tight T-shirts is like slim fit tight T-shirts now the trend is
loose or slightly oversized T-shirts so
err
it's weird lah if you ask me
meh
what trumpist
rare commodity okay
oh okay wait hold up hold up you're referring to you're referring to
oh okay lah that's pretty american lah you don't I don't see that the the closest thing I've seen in singapore is um
err I think there was one time I think err can't remember what's her name ah she wore a baseball T-shirt
she wore that was like baseball baseball outfit
to work
no lah but filipino is like that what they that's their that's their sport ah
that that's their sport it's the same as it's the same logic as
I think philippines
philippines they have a they are known to really like
they are known to like basketball
and they are also known for engineering and nursing also that's why
you see ah like when err back in my old workplace ah the one before
the one before
the guy err he also told me also and
the place there right there were quite a handful lah there were quite a lot of err filipino guys ah
so ya
oh okay
damn
filipino ah to begin with
how sure are you
really
okay
okay fine whatever
wei xiang is which one
oh wait it
okay right then
mm
really
wait
what's he is he working there full time what what's his position there what's he doing exactly in
until now
and that's such a waste ah
like I mean err I get I mean if
if your highest hopes in life right is to be a cashier
for a departmental store right then more power to you lah but
it kind of sounds like a shame ah what did he study when he was in when he was pursuing his diploma
ah
can can you I don't know got stocks to trade for FairPrice that kind of thing ah
oh really
really
okay I really I probably wouldn't know any of this shit
a million dollars
what kind of lifestyle like player player
okay
that's gay
this is this
wait is he still with the same guy
until now
not that I care lah but
err
err my question is right
what is that guy doing
tool
hold up jack's is the okay ya then
wait which again the one at ang mo kio
oh really wait there there's a jack's in ang mo kio meh
no okay that one I know already it's that one wait is that is that one still around
wait so it's it's an affiliate of jack's ah it's like one of the sister companies ah
or like
okay lah fine
you know it doesn't take a diploma her his higher his esteemed diploma right from
were from whatever polytechnic right you know you you can you know work as a cashier at you know with
err less with less than qualifications right
he is aware of that right
oh how the tables have turned
hold up the boyfriend is rich still mooches off

so was that the turning point
for him turning homosexual
okay
mm you can't you can't put a you can't put a price on love right though
wei xiang two hundred range
hais oh my gosh
your friends right your friends are like
extra retarded ah for real
so joe rogan
that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing ah
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics ah in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to
I mean like what like what you
be you you be super hot you take a photo right of you being hot right around starving africans
is that ethical
wait which one was it
no
probably because you didn't feed it to me
lies lies okay anyways
so is the sister the sister is
wait what okay fine ya okay ya ya
oh okay okay wait hold up hold up so
technically right technically he
he didn't he didn't flash
in a sense right in a sense right
he advertised himself right as he
he try to proposition for
ah for sex right for minors
from minors right with
by
know using using his fame ah not with paper ah
oh really
come with me in my videos
who is him dee kosh
would you want to know dee kosh
why not
so wait this is what gay privilege
oh wait hold up that amber
huh which finger
okay then
Tesla guy
the elon musk okay fine then
but to begin with right does he does he even know right that
those people are minors or not the his victims right
did he know that they were minors
okay
if that was the case right my question is
who are the people right who empower dee kosh
where does dee kosh derive right his fame from YouTube right who empowers him
is the youth of today
why
because right we're easily swayed we're easily we're easily swayed right by stupid shit
by simple stupid shit
to begin with also right
that's it
am I right to say am I right to say I can't remember what's the author's name ah err am I right to say right that
err the person who wrote catcher in the rye right
err the person in the catcher who wrote catcher in the rye right is a influencer
because he influenced the guy to go and assassinate the the kennedy
you know kennedy ya
ah ah okay oh my goodness ya john lennon ya
to influence them to do what
okay
but Instagram by itself right but but Instagram by Instagram by itself right
is just a platform only ah is the people is to me right
to me if you ask me personally right I would say that it's the kids of today ah it's
the young impressionable kids of today right who are so drawn into
nonsense antics right who
who follow this guy ah who give this guy a following who
in return right he generates he generates revenue right from
err you know from uh from his
the the legions the legions from his legions of ah from his
no the legions of followers that he has uh uh okay I'm being sarcastic lah about the legions lah cause I don't think he has
he got he got himself into he got himself into
into this kind of into this kind of nonsense then to amplify this to amplify the
situation right on a personal on I guess on at
face value level type
thing ah he
you know he makes a living he he makes a living talking about people mah and also like talking to
see what happened lah the tables have turned the tables have turned already ah the tables have turned lah err it
come it kind of like goes to show right that
you're not as smart as you think you are lah you probably didn't plan
you probably didn't plan your you didn't have a contingency for backlash ah
you didn't you didn't see you you couldn't possibly see right you're just so considered you're so considered right in your
five them ah that you didn't
everybody you know everybody ah has
everyone has skeletons
everybody has skeletons including yourself you know everybody has skeletons but now you make
you make the profession ah you make a living you know by by make a living ah you
earn money eh to feed yourself you know not now I we don't talk about other people ah you feed yourself right with
with
err talking very poorly talking down on people err pointing out people's mistakes and all uh and all that you know
everybody does this you know you know gossipping right
girls gossip also what we are doing now right is actually gossipping ah we're gossipping about other person
but your but I think it's important right that
we have to gossip truthfully you know we have to gossip truthfully

he he puts it online ah he he
in in a sense right he broadcast it he broadcast his opinions his opinions on people and then
look what has happened ah like
most of the singaporean singaporean celebs lah I kind of like hate all of them

those irritating irritating nonsense eh on err they do irritating nonsense right then they upload it on YouTube
knowingly right post it on social media then everybody were to know
you can go ahead and comment lah but then again when it comes to when it
it's err it's too it's too malicious ah like
it's it's really too it's really too malicious already ah like
err like for me for me right the videos eh
her work probably isn't really that
isn't isn't that great ah because like from the looks of it right she's not really that deep ah to in in all honesty she's not
she she's not that deep ah like the you know
my heart right my heart ah the the abyss that is my heart right is probably is probably deeper ah
that she did right is
she
she kind of like jams

eh
I don't know
I hope they don't throw their bodies
suspect
witness
mm

I wonder if like you can really like walk on the rain
hmm
or maybe sing some ariana grande songs you know you never know
eh
but you'll be in a suit
unless the wig is on the suit
oh I know the music video for rain on me
mm ya ya ya ya
but I don't want like the the flying the raining knives
ah
it's really nice
it was like in the beginning
so many times some more
mmhmm how about you
wow
I love black hole
oh it's glowing a bit
so there's like
what is it is it water and
no no don't touch me there don't this is my no no square square
no no don't touch me there this is my no no square
a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world ah these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
eh
just over there
mm
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also lah
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
ah how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
ah about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time oh wow yet
amazing ah
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
oh please ah
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
wah what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know meh
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
mm
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
um I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
oo and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
mm
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers um
mmhmm
transportation eh
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation
ya I think I'd rather be I'd rather have teleportation because flying need still need to use energy
but literally we can just teleport anywhere you want
wendy
wizard of oz
might be wanda wanda fairy fairly oddparents
ya
and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though
that you always want to learn but you haven't learnt yet
E two
investment
stock
stock trading
why would you want to learn that
but it's so like hectic though
I thought I will get migraine
but you
mind opening
ya
actually I don't know how it works also
but you have to call it and then like someone just get high ya I don't know
that is very fascinating
oo
nobody thinks about
what do I think about your
I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
hmm
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it lah basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow
a'ah
Enfagrow

she's like
sometimes I feel
before the meltdown
princess
ya I feel like she's a good entertainer err
I think she was like like
ee ee
ya like especially when they started young
ya ya like if you started very young then you grow up
feeling very
like empty because you got
everything that you need
ya
ya
now what ya
I mean if I think about it lah it's a good life to live but
ya it's just managing your mental health
true
mental health advocate
but I feel like
the only way you can train yourself to have a healthy mind is to always be open about your emotions and your thoughts
you cannot like keep it inside you once you keep it inside you
a'ah
eww
oh my god
air

so does that make me a rainbow baby I guess so
ya
oh rainbow
oh wow
it's true it's true
if I could be a drink I would like to be a teh cino
but I am a teh cino
because it's like sweet I mean it can be sweet if you want to it depends on how you stir the tea so if you stir it well I can be really sweet to you but if you don't stir it well might be sweet at
first but then once nope I could be bitter at first but then once you reach the bottom I could be really sweet
but then if you mix it also the colour the colour of the teh cino is also my colour of the skin

err ya ya ya
ya ya
where your farm lah farm farm
ya
ya
ya ya uh I don't know what is that called but ya the the buggy part
buggy
ya now I know now I know
you mean the wait you mean the buggy you want that big
oh
oh oh
ya like now like small
ya
okay just imagine a small house is already okay expensive eh then imagine a golf club
it's like
oh true
migrate ah migrate
ya
vacation house vacation
actually like staycation also can
ah ah ah ah vacation house ya ya ya like ya
I think like some people now also do like that
ya
um
no
never but but I ya I mean like now I don't have a lot of relative that stays um
ya so now like that's but then I don't mind I want to like have the experience
of like living in a
pulau ubin eh
is it like the model and I think
is it like the modern one ah I think I think they have I I think I got see before maybe not a lot lah maybe like a few
because I don't think it can last very long
eh then must wear shoe in house
my house lah my house
okay for me I like
leaning towards modern side lah kan
um I would love um private property lah
but ah landed landed property
but that's if I can afford it lah kan if not then hmm maybe
just a ya
ya dream my dream house you see
ya
because I just wanna be so that you know cause I like to have uh gatherings with like either like friends or family so I I like this kind of like interaction with the loved ones
ya so
ya so like exactly so that our house don't be like so like you know very quiet or like very like everyday like that
you see like that same same faces same like ya
ya but I mean it would be nice lah but of course the maintenance wise is different
so if I were to downgrade my dream house may um
um
I don't know eh because now the houses in singapore like small right like the house like very small so like
I would look uh towards the resale side resale house lah ya
ya mm
cannot get bungalow get that one can lah
ah like like jumbo like that ya that one also nice ya but again if I can afford
but now
ya I I heard it's still okay ya see the area also lah
I don't know eh wait
jurong that side is what area
west then tampines east
then north is central north lah
yishun
ah okay
okay
I know but I confused with the north south east west simi ya
um maybe more towards
north lah and also east
ya the east side and north side
because I feel okay the east side I like I like east side because like there's like happening there
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
ya
changi okay
ya
can travel
oh to then go to batam oh
mm
sidetrack sidetrack kan ya
okay lah more more I don't know ah
hmm
to travel to central
uh actually okay lah okay lah ah ya north north hmm eh actually okay lah for me like okay if I look at my where my parents stay eh
um
north is nearer
I mean okay we are I'm at the middle ah I mean now like my parents living is at the middle
but I would rather uh go uh to north
east
it would be a very long journey home whether I take train or I take bus lah
is it
ah ya lah ya lah I mean like towards the towards the woodlands ah the bukit batok
ya especially like uh the the khatib and that one yio chu kang that one like for real I feel like tomorrow then I reach
ya but okay lah
mm I mean central is the best lah
I say like for a dream house right the house to be like
mm ya lah
oh okay lah okay okay ya
mmhmm
ya mattar is inconvenient those that have uh blue line is quite uh
no lah no um because my my area don't have any line what I mean like the nearest is purple line and red line
ya
so all the blue blue line is like so far apart
like for me
ya
but we still no dot
we still like out of the region
mmhmm
right
ah it's always the issue
executive mansion executive is dubbed mansion ah is it maisonette
it's this big
it's that category ah
so executive
okay
what
ya
mm
okay now now that kind of house is I mean like um now the normal house eh resale house already like half a million already you know
like like my area my area is already five hundred plus plus K already
ya ya my my house is uh reach half a million already like above
ya like above above ya
I mean like they of course they have thoughts of like moving lah but then
not at the moment
ya
four
cause it's very long already sia it's like
thirty over years
and
I think because it's not say accessible but then like it's like we live at central central
um maybe
I say like woodlands or what right it will take less than half an hour
ya but if like you go by bus or what usually
ya more than half an hour like forty minutes
ya then like my area there I think because like
I don't know
no not a lot of things I think because it's balestier so balestier like
I don't know ah
like the outside part lah
not my my inside part got a lot of like elderly
ya especially elderly ya
but that but that house like wow
eh what what
why were we talking about it just now
oh okay ya
so mm so I think if like other area
um
of course like if if there is I mean like executive I don't think it will be below
ya
ya
like I like go for it already seh
ya then I'll be like very lucky
ya so I would go with like six or seven
one million ah
dude that one I might as well I take landed right
actually landed and
if if okay if I were to take landed and
executive right I mean it's it's not really far apart what right
then if I were to like work even a bit more harder or wait longer then maybe I can get a good landed
eh
I mean that if like is what I want lah
ya
ya I think our area this the central central is like already
ya
ah
mm
okay
that's why ya
because like I mean like especially like in our generation right we will take even longer to like pay compared to our parents' time
ya I think our parents' time
ya
mmhmm ya ya ya standard
high already
well tomorrow I buy
ya oh my god
mm
golf club
oh
I think you can
mmhmm
uh then
billion ah oh that's wah
wah
means you would be the richest there already
I mean if you were to
ya
a pool of
ya oh my god
I don't think it will be a mini golf I think will be quite big already
ya I think you can like fit in a few houses
ya
you can have your own cafe there you can have your own like what arcade there oh my god
oh my god ya it will be so
mm actually
ya it's just it's just here lah because like you know here four room kan you can buy like a landed at
mm
mm I think so
ya that's why that's why people a lot go to melbourne ah
or go australia that area
considerable
then you get a garden a mini swimming pool I'm happy with that already
I'm happy with that
uh you like will confirm go eh like you know that you have a vacation like stay eh you can just like holler at me
ya
I I have I have a friend
then like she err
the she got a house
so like she was like saying
and the house is like err landed at
and the house is like err landed at then said eh you guys want to um go we can go just stay at my house lah
okay sure okay lah why not right I mean like ya
ah then after that we just like ah nevermind lah we just find another time ya
then now like all busy so like
ya exactly exactly
don't know lah when that time
the but that time like almost lah then after that like
alone eh because err the parents
err
was held back because they were supposed to go back for like some event
then after that she have to like go first then the parents um err
left her behind lah I think no ah I think she was with the sisters
ya but I but she say that time she go first then the parents because the parents drive
so like
so it's like
ya I mean like it's best if like you know we can go with her then like
hmm but then ah
ya I I think everyone will like
bye singapore no no population sia
every time all all like go to malaysia
ya
but but in order to I feel like in order for us to like live a good life in malaysia
like we need to work in singapore
like our income must be from here then then we can live a good life there
unless you work very hard there lah but then it's hardly also to see
ya true
cost of living if retailers you could do as I knew
it's like the same like we live um staying in singapore ya
it's like times three of what we earn know
imagine if you earn one K and there is like three K
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
woodlands so ah
ya
mmhmm
at
oh oh singapore oh okay
ah
ya ya
ya ya ya
no in the investment
ah ya
exactly like easy money ah like that ya
it's like um you know in when I was in uh in
like a few of my officer
that have like around err four room or three room
four room or three room then
after that uh
they they but they don't they never stay at that house
so they rent out to people rent rent to people ah so that one house eh
eh one I think one room eh
they charge um
ya they charge
I think one K
ya they charge around one K one K plus
so imagine and and full know full it's like okay that four room eh
okay so it's three room one hall right so that three room is occupied
then one person imagine one person is one K plus if I'm not wrong
then wah then really then he like doing for like four years already now then imagine how
how how much he get already in one year then plus his pay
then then he even like talk to me saying that oh I actually thought of like you know getting another condo
ya but I don't think I'll be living there lah I will rent to people also then I like wah
so much things to carry
ya but then like the money is good lah then like okay my that
that officer of mine is not okay is married but don't even have a child yet
so like
and he's like old already so I don't know if like they want to have a child or not lah
so I don't know like ya with that a lot of money what is he going to do with that
ya
freehold no
mmhmm mm
this for condo
some some of it ah
wah
mm can take over and stuff like that ya
mmhmm
ya
ya ya ya true wah
mm
mmhmm
what kind of like job they do like middle family because some some of them
is is for you actually you know it's though it's a gift or something like that then from there they like make it even bigger
ya you know like I want ya it's a I think like
um
some of like err my friends
like they they they mentioned
um what is that
like their family has a asset
actually I think for them or something like that so so they actually um
their their parents only get to
err release that thing
err to what is it
oh sorry like a lot of things going on in my mind
a lot a lot of things going inside the room
okay
okay so okay I let me restart
good family
ah ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like uh for them so at a certain age then uh it will be uh released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at uh one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them lah what what they want to use it as
so
uh
so
ya lah they
um
they they have plans they already planned what they want to do with that money
oh that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know lah they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know
so like ya
err there's nothing over here what is it ah
ah
then
then suddenly aman need earpiece
my earpiece oh is it this one is it your earpiece this one
oh ya about tell eh do what
oh well
inside the container
inside the container container is this the container
black colour
black colour below one
orh
where is let me see before you give it to him okay
sorry it's okay bye bye
bye
then
then
and after then mm ya lah I think there's a lot of like then and then and uh so and so
ya
ya so so he already plan out lah like what he want to do with the money it's either he
uh buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
not most lah I mean like a few I mean like uh I have this few friends only so like
most of them okay I just say most of them like um plan to do like a business
or like maybe like go like overseas or something like um like their business is like
to ah
to
err overseas lah so like
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age ah then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
oh they can
they are mature enough to handle the money lah
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like or like you know they they like oh nevermind lah just we uh see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like oh okay lah see lah I think I think my father um
the the the friend
um uh son got a business so they thought of like you know just uh taking me in and work for them then um like everything is like already there the choice are there so they just need to choose
them I'm like wah so pampered one ya
so ya I think this uh I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what lah
ya
see their background lah
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
mmhmm
exactly
mm
just nice
mmhmm
mmhmm
degree degree
actually right
okay continue nevermind
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach um the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
um
ya because like I feel like because uh I have this uh conversation lah with my um
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not um under err not really under
ah private or something like that but he go to schools lah to conduct
the classes so like
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like um he just keep on doing like uh freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
increase his err rapport or something like that
you get um what is that
ah
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
recommendations also lah and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
ah then you take degree lah I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
ah
I mean it's good lah I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
uh like a bonus point ah oh okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like hmm but then of course um I want to do degree lah but
see lah how it goes
oh my god
uh as at that time I check
it was for one year eh for one year degree is around two five
two five
two five thousand
ah if for that one year
for that one year
ya because um half of the year
it's um overseas
uh labrador labrador
labrador park
I don't know uh uh I know what's the it's at uh australia eh
I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed lah like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya lah of course lah but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
then like wah but really like hustling ah then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
project works ya project works then like their on come eh accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid lah it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like wah
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary lah
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
thirty plus lah late thirties
means that the older you get the the older you get your
the older you get
okay
I mean like when you want to give birth the older you get
the harder it is I mean like the guy
this one about mental you know and emotional ah
emotional and mental um
don't know because of what maybe because of health issues because you're getting older or what
then
eh you can't continue continue eh continue the tradition or the the the
ya
I mean like both their different
uh pros and cons um a different
ya
mm
mmhmm
I mean it's okay if like the girl is like younger
ya
mm it's okay lah
ah lah ah lah
I mean it has been like that for the longest time lah ya
wah then that one I like really have to chiong you know I mean like
ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
ya slack off
ya
mm
because of how you take the things lah ah how you like actually
uh handle the situation
ya like more more like career minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path lah
where be like the economy and such right so
mm mmhmm mm ya
ya
true lah
mm
I'll be like
ah that's the thing
as in like ah saving plan
but it's also like hard lah I mean like how if that if you get like one
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
then how seh like that
mm ya mm
some like uh my friend
err
and be eh
two point five ya two point five then after that
ah got commission so let's say if like she
uh managed to like err sell something or this um particular plan or what eh to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then wah she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then um they give her more
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like uh workers also will cut down what
then after that the one that is being uh cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay lah her pay got uh drop lah dropped by a few percent only like not much
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
ah
I mean like if she get to sell um that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
mmhmm
so she have her own one and uh the friend commission
oh you mean uh the commission extra
yes
ya ya
mm
mmhmm
ah
like that ah
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
get what I mean
ah
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
err because like the err company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two um
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
uh that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so it's like
because their their workload is doubled ah so of course their pay also in a way
doubled ah
amazing eh
like you like your leave you cannot just
then it like you really need to
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need um income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say lah she say to the boss that
oh um you know um my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
uh a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my uh family ya
they having this uh conversation and like this um argument and it's like about this thing ah then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that ah exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate lah
so like okay lah
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still uh working there
but she said that she won't be err staying lah I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say um stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard ah
ya
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
will not have a
to go through like this uh
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know lah in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya lah just that
I feel that now uh people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead
their death box ya
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
ah
because because I know err I think err my my relative eh
so uh this saving eh that they have eh is for like emergency for like maybe
okay
urgent emergency
ya
eh don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
but that simple simple also need money what
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
amazing but still like it's like lah I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
ah then after that into the point where uh where the mum have to step in the mum like
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know lah so of course the mum need to like mm twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya ah then the mum was like saying hais ah then this one also I have to like hmm
whole thing lah
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to err burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out ah
ah that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift lah a gift
ya
mm then okay lah ya
mm
ya
mm mm mm
ya I think it's
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
because like you know uh so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
uh I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in um
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here lah
and she have a family in singapore lah because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one ah like the family in singapore lah
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like oh this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate lah then my mum
try to understand also
but okay lah I mean like
different people different lah ah
ya like they they they know that okay uh this wedding
uh I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute err this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
ah renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what kan
like my this err aunty set like err
this big amount lah
ya but
mm
ya that's the thing
like some people join what this err what is that called
so after less interview of time
ya uh I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
ah at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
but err the but uh it's hundred fifty times twenty five
times the months lah
orh
mm
I think they have different different like
mmhmm
ya
but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like
ya like like not not say illegal lah I mean like like legal
but it's riskier
uh I don't know
ya
ya I mean if you think that it's okay okay ah
ya
mm
mm ya
but this cannot be shared with you
um children ah if you if you have children
like this saving things you should not err I mean like
maybe
ya
until like they reach a certain age or what ya because it's scary because like they can you never know what will you know what they would what you expect them to do like
ya

so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles one but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often

for the
essay the two thousand word essay I'm only at like nine hundred words so ya

because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy lah because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like um
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year what
ya
no
ya
ya
I also don't know see what have lah what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
ya
ya
no eh no preference
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
um
bake it
oh
the old chang kee one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the ondeh-ondeh and the red velvet one
ya the ondeh-ondeh one
but it's like
the ondeh-ondeh one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the ondeh-ondeh because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was uh on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
ya
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the briyani with the potato also can
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the bhatoora like in the morning eat very nice ah but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
ah got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like oh maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying ah so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first uh
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
kunafe is which one
mm I don't think I tried kunafe before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first uh I think like
ah cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
oh ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at joo chiat right like err that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
huh ang mo kio A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W oh no that one is shake shack
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
ya but I think I like it ah cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
ya
ya
and uh
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know err during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
so
ya
ya during december then err I also meeting like some of my err like
I want uh we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how lah because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed ah because like we all thought like err we all planned already and then like that night last minute uh that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her mah but don't know how lah see how
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel oh the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at jurong point anymore I only eat the
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
you guys can eat bingsu or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat lah but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things what
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it seh
if not
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
then
that time also
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people lah but you cannot like err four hundred dollars
ya
I think
err if not you can go bugis like the bugis haji area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to bugis street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's err like it's like affordable uh not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
err ya and then if not you can go to the that time the joo chiat
changi area
around her area
choa chu kang area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite ulu mah so ya
ya
that time I went with her at jurong east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like uh the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad lah but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
oh ya cannot refund right
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
huh if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go bali
indonesia
I don't think will have
oh I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but
ya that one that one the mango lassi very nice
oh ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash ah
oh
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like eh a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
ya
ya like I spray like my class nine eight right I spray right until like I spray like on my like on my because I was wearing like inner clothing then I was wearing outer clothing so I spray on the inner clothing on my body also until like
like

a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before oh but then ya and bangkok lah stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad
the toxicity is not as bad as it was before but then ya
and
rank up lah stop being a chicken alamak err
where got I feel that level that time I saw you play okay what
okay what
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on freya but okay
unfriend
okay lah
I keep on saying okay lah sia but okay
what okay lah
the rank the rank
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible eh but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called yu zhong yu zhong
whatever
have another fighter eh but since you say you play freya freya right
freya freya has
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
eh I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
wah okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
it's okay you can
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
yet eh masha is not a tank masha is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
eh walao I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have
ya so it's like
ah
it went there there there there there it's okay
there there there there there it's okay
I mean it's true sometimes in life nah I don't know what to say cause like I ain't no therapist unlike you
but eh but if you play hilda or what then I just support you lor
but I'll be there okay I'll be there I'll be playing my marksman or my
ya
eh what other what other tank eh I feel that hylos also not bad eh
it's for you
ya hylos like ya
ya hilda and during
draft pick right they also
ya ya legit legit like they always did
or tank just odd ah and there's no one who'd ban hilda
so I think there's a good chance you can
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
once in a while they will ban ling
ah ling
who they ban who I forgot
but now kan instead of two
they ban three each so each team ban three
so total six
players six heroes away ban
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay I really want andes I really want the fiery chicken oh my god okay I'm salivating
let's go find this but lunch lah
best pe
or like eh I'll be late
oh ya eh but wah the leave oh he's taking he'll be taking two days leave ah
okay now I feel very bad
ya whole day leave
lunch
no we're not bringing our rice cooker
oh
that's not happening okay we're not gonna repeat that
I can't really we bought a rice cooker for a staycation
okay this is such a
such a
feisty thing to say out loud
yes we bought rice cooker for our staycay previously and it was so it was so handy I admit though I mean come on man you gotta admit that it's very handy dandy
it's like what we cook maggi we cook pau we steam pau some more leh
okay okay no but we're not going to bring that rice cooker for sure
because over there right they already provide us with pots and pans
but ya we're not going to bring rice cooker
and no I'll make sure you don't bring your
freaking luggage
that's not going to happen because it's just
it's three days two nights so we're not going to have
a lot actually
I take that back I think I'm going to bring a lot of stuff also
luggage
okay okay then we
eh but the thing is we're going to eat lunch outside
dinner
it will be side tracked again actually in a way sort of
okay maybe not really
because right
okay I don't know
I'm actually imagining it right now
okay the fact that oh my god
haizat he fully endorsed it
I'm questioning our friendship why why are we friends with these kind of people
but
ya I wanted to mention that
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
so it's like
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay lah if you don't you nasty
okay day two
in the morning we going to prepare some breakfast
okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in ang mo kio before but I mean from here to ang mo kio is a bit like um but ya I thought if oh I know I know three one three lah
bounce kan ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that
but ya we can go there
eh but there's no shower place also right around the area I think we just change our clothes
then I just hope zat don't tell us to you know
go back to
you go grab home go back grab
but then like at the same time I feel like I want to fully utilise that
ya
eh I ya to what as in like you are indeed very correct because why why go out when you can stay in inside a cosy little
container with aircon with all the things you need like
youtube netflix
what why go out okay lah I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
hmm
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time
okay you
so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity mm
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far meh
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends ah okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out what it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in lah we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap mah like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever lah that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we dabao to container
do not talk about my winx club like that winx club
that's not a very nice of you okay that's very mean move what's wrong with watching that I mean you watch barney you watch other stuff also so okay like cartoons are cartoons they are like entertaining
oh excuse me every single time I refer something about spongebob you be like oh I know that one you sure you don't talk much okay don't talk so much
if you don't watch spongebob and it's all memory based then how did it came about that means you did watch spongebob
excuse me sir are you judging all those people that are watching my little pony
no but the thing is right
the thing is our staycay we haven't even finish talking
you know what

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

so how you today nas
oh ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix lah
oh favourite eh
oh right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no lah
but they still do watch the anime ah
but
err cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
uh september twenty nineteen
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
orh ya
exactly
oh
ah
oh
ah at the sorry ah at the mountain right
oh ya
wah
so
does that mean ah in the future will be a demand also
oh ya
orh ya that one is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six eh wah he's really strong
ya
such coward
wah
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
but but
it really blews me away ah blows me away sorry
ah opening ah
mm
mm ya
ya
it's like err one thing good about anime is like there's no
ah pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
um
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
mind blowing ah legit
ya
ya
ya
um
mm ya
uh one piece
ya
oh ya
not too much
it's it's uh it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
orh ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
exactly cause that's why I I always ah
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for ah films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
ah ya
ah ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
oh ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take oh wait no other than that got physics lah but that's all lah physics should be simpler because this one
its pre-calculus sia what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
oh is it the
the position vector eh
wow
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
ya so err ya that's why exactly but okay lah the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you err encounter like many problem solving ah methods or like
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me ah because one thing um
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with um other people or like
uh actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to ah do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like mm I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
mm
ya
uh ya ya
mm
that sounds
crystallisation thinking eh
wow
mm
mm
uh soft skills that they're born with
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill lah but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
uh your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood lah in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own uh thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you ah in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
uh you you just you don't want to bring up the uh negative uh vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts lah so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
ah ya
mm ya
mm
ah ya ya ya ya ya
mm
ya and and in okay ah in university especially
okay
cannot
huh
mm
mm
ya
mm
drop
mm
ya
orh
oh wow
wow
it's uh it's the same thing for my my school also cause err if I'm not wrong ah is err when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university lah if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but uh if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time um if you are if you have a academic warning already
lesser than two point eight
suspension meaning
ya
ah ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
ah
mm
ah
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam ah
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
oh eh
wah
orh okay I
uh
hmm
mm
mm
huh
oh
ya
but is it mean the same thing
prof oh professor
french
orh is it
mm
oh I
ah
mm
um is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in uh game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is uh user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience ah since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
ah kan so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this uh tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say um enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you ah if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
ah
ya
ah
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness lah
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it uh
they imagine them like eh with this
I I'll look good ah like ah with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
mm
ya
exactly
but I guess um
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
um elon musk eh he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can ah achieve
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
ah if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was err I okay lah when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy lah of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
ah their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
oh ah sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
uh we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to lah
ah ah ya roller coaster
mm ya you have to take a break ah
that's why I feel
uh
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
which is why I also like how um okay lah not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
wow
Marvel is uh huge scale of
all the things that you ah
you imagine it to happen
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero ah but with no actual superpower
orh ya
cool
orh
ah
mm
ya
the black widow and iron man started
mm
oh ya
gauntlet
ya
um assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
you'll feel good lah
make your drive even
uh
higher
so that one err I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
uh good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements ah but in that case also like if you were to think about it ah
now eh ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay lah maybe
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make ah it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
uh it's it's hard ah is the most hardest thing for me
orh
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like ah if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be ah okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
ah ah too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses lah there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
mm can say lah
ya ya
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay lah before
uni ah you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like uh you learn programming all this and that it's useful because ah we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
uh how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
uh good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
ah exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
uh biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
for educational purpose
oh but okay lah cone
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
it's a good it's a
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
ah ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth sia
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years lah give or take
in
oh
ya
strap eh
orh oh ya
probably they
eh eh best sia
oh man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive ah to experience it
persevere humanity to maintain young
orh
ah ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
oh
a'ah akaza
a demon
orh
oh ya
I will still stay young what I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
ah
ah upper moon
ya
same
mm
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live ah eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said um
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
err people who die I don't know ah this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die lah normally
ya
that's humans lah in a way ah that it's a beauty ah like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know lah but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
ah set the bar
ya
ah wrestling or any any person in interest lah like oh
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already lah even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any uh
impact yet
ya maradona
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few uh weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
ah
passing
ah ya ya
it's like it heightens your
ah I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he uh that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film eh or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
ah
exactly
which is why I like anime
stop lah am I at taiwan taiwan at times already ah okay lah hello ah actually ah K bye

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
meal
meal
oh
meal
mm my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya err but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
ya
mm
he likes to go for hunting he has a
I don't know what it call the long one
sniper I think so yes
err I'm not very sure how it works
err
you know paddy field
not swan the the very
err slim as
the the tall bird
who who who who the bird likes to stand on one feet
huh
ya but it's not so big it's a small one
that one I tried before
when I was a small child I think
ya that meat was
so I don't have that
err courage
to try
mm um things like I don't know why
meat
ya
err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say
yes
mm
um
for me
drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual
right
so I'm okay with any
ya anything I'm I'm okay
ya so I like like
err
short film ah short film
even movie also
okay lah
movie
movie also okay
I'm I also like cartoons
but I like
err shrek
err rapunzel
frozen ya
ya
mm
I think I watch one
I like avatar
yes
really
mm
then I also like twilight
ya
yes
ya
but I like the
actually ah more than I don't know I don't remember exactly the story but more than that I like where it was shot like this was like inside a forest right
ya so I like the background
uh the songs
uh
storyline also
okay lah
ya
ya
huh
prepared to sit and watch but I I it's a a but I like to watch them
uh
I think the most um movie
ya
huh
tobey
ya
err the maybe it's because the first one I watched
mm
mm
ah
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you mean err
professors doing part time
they have other jobs right
mm
mm
to meet your mentor
who who is your mentor is it a professor
okay
mm
mm
uh
so how do you find your course uh is it you liking it
you mean your your A level friends
mm
your your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
oh they have and all masters and all ah
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
mm
mm
mm
teaching
then
um but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya
fried rice
oh mee hoon tom yum
okay
ah
okay
so how was the rice today uh the mandi rice
the smoke is just like only on the surface
ya
curry
hmm
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best um mandi rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
mm
okay
mm
pizza hut
hey which pizza you ate ah
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
err tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of

master bedroom
mm
orh
then
who know how to paint
hmm
frame
then
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
remember ah I want to make that wall I want to
what's that
they have the drawer
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
of anything ah
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway what
huh
mm
but I think
I think no need raised floor lah
then does it really have a purpose
then
quite isolated from the rest of the room tau to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
a'ah
and then the one behind behind the entrance
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
you understand or not
a'ah
ah a'ah a'ah
ah but we make it minimalistic ah
ah
mm
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble what
so maybe matching ah
mm
mm
which bedroom the small one
mm
master mm
the second one is the second one smack you okay then
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
then
you don't want to buy playstation meh

the raised floor is about knee length
okay
mm
okay
ah
mmhmm
ah
L
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
laptop and all

because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know
ah
ya so that one need maintenance
mmhmm

mm
then you no weights ah

mm
okay lah
then
you'll never know
I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want

mm
because okay last time people use console because they got speakers got player now don't have already what all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of right everything is installed inside right so
by right ah by right you don't need console but we are buying console temporary because

mmhmm
ya
uh huh
no
the mount is not inside the inside the wall you know
no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
ya lah where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that uh beside that wall is already the window
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm

he was my friend
a strangle
then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit

but that's terrible ah
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense ah

brother herme
kan
right
ayip
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
and all that
then on the way back err I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
oh down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things ah
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
ah then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired ah
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
ah us ya
so um then he was saying how um
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
err
kan
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think hilmi actually supports ah no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do lah
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up ah
then he was saying how um
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that ah
so now what now is just
huh huh
it's
it doesn't feel
great ah
I was telling him ah like they are gonna
ah when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him eh I but mine wasn't cause of cheating ah of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit tau
ya
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
eh
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
hey brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
oh wow
wow that's that's going into the wrong direction ah
so anyways right
ya so um about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough ah
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch ah
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
ah his his actions from a moral standpoint ah
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am lah kan
uh being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given ah
mm
I don't know that's a very controversial statement ah
so by those dates
you you describe it as um
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that one it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender lah like that's true
right
okay
fahim isn't exactly mister olympia material himself pe
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the err
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life ah
at wah that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
wah I cannot
sial ah
brunei
eh no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
ah people in brunei

income people there

free education free healthcare
right
I mean
but healthcare is not free what
ya
oh ya
so basically I was
I was talking about ah about ruqayyah and then we talking about ya okay so

wait so there are
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
no no no no no
ah
you know
eh
wow
why does it sound mm
mmhmm
like it just physical
oh man
wow
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a revenge thing ah
maybe
very complicated stuff

my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos jer

I
I think I know which one you're talking about like the picture

and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
mm
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it ah
ya
alright
in law no not yet so ah cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
ah german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course ah and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so um it's like things to do if the if uh for you know respiratory things ah
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing uh this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time ah he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit siao also
ah quarterly report or something lah
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message ah
saying that you know
um good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email ah
then then at then a while ago were like complaining ah how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
ah then
he will he told me he told me that first ah that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay ah this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two ah
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like oh why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else lah right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
um the initial thing was
they wanted to get married ah this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents lah of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing lah like
ya this kind of
ya so um and then what you call it ah then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that uh he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam ah
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it woo you can go on for like this ah but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it lah then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also lah I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
eh you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy what
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then um
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
wuhan flu and all that
ah chinese cough as they say
and then err
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and um
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow ah from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved ah which is fair
ya lah of course lah you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay ah mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up ah
then uh
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
ah and they were kind of
having some progress ah but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause uh kan they both work from home
like
uh my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
um
ya then ah he goes over to his place a lot cause uh K so my my parents live in bedok south right which is
basically near tanah merah right
then he lives at the condo at tanah merah
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once pe
ya
so she goes over there like every other day ah to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
ah okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya sia ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it lah
one of those guys
ya
and then ah she's there like every other day then um that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of eh why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about uh that issue like my sister
um being over there lah what
and saying how oh
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do ah
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya lah exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time ah he talked to me and uh he brought me out for beers
ah I've got things to do ah
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course lah so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones lah it's just to like you know
ah ya
so anyway um what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
ah at first if his parents have some reservations ah about him
going out with a malay asian girl ah
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no ah ah whoa this just whoa whoa that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like ah muslim countries lah right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way tau
was it mm
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first lah

okay so I'm natasha and
whoa
the part ya ya ya before we hit the seven mark
yes you break the contract then bye bye
there goes the documentary that we've been planning
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
oh
sometimes I still think about the bunny chow
right
ya I know like legit
so ya we had the bunny chow in
south africa cape town
and it is just
and that was great
why was it great ah I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
oh
mm
poof
ya
is memorable right I think it's like the
ya and the area we were at was like
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
uh huh
a'ah
a'ah
oh ya the customer ya
err I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
I try to remember
ya
the burger right
perbezaan dia memang
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
cause we were given only ah ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
oh
mmhmm
it was basically
right
ya we ate samosa
kan
kan something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
it was the thing
ya
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food lah
mmhmm
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like nata got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like nata look at there but I was driving
no it's not is it a pani
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was um meat there was what cheese
of the full and then we were like ya one one uh beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
a'ah
not
a'ah
ya
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner tau we ate lunch and dinner we ate that one
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
the next day for breakfast
kan
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
like mm
cape town and they also oh it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like oh my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
to be fair they tried to warn us
err speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
ah we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
um the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
ah
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as bukit timah hill
ya and
it was quite high like
ah in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like eh
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
ya
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
so we entered the wrong entrance lah basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
and I also think
hiking stick
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
ah that that's the plan ah that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
hais
you told her
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
eh but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city lah cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
uh huh
uh huh
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
we we bail out
ah what else
okay how about we start with food
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
um south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
ah the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
oh ya I think cause we were at the coast
ah yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
ah ah ah
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
ish
they not mature yet
ya so like
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
woohoo that kind of thing but then we went in like meh we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
a'ah
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
ya ya
I think he enjoy it lah
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
kayaking in the river right
ya I that one I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
a'ah
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
oh my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend tau
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
hais
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically oh really I'm so sorry
ah okay hmm
a cave
mm
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
eh
do you want to see another prompt
err if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
oh
oh
ya I mean
it's still considered art
sure
okay
one skill
um
one new skill
hmm
ah I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I asked
ice
cause kaysa does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
ice skate at and then amy amy follow but then amy almost died
so ya I was like ya if I live somewhere
where there's a lake
I would definitely learn and there's winter I would definitely learn how to
ice skate for fun
that be fun
two more skills
ya
oh okay

no no but err okay lah that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay lah
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like jer take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour

mm mm
ya
mm
mm
it was really tricky ah ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
mm mm mm mm
damn
mm gym-ing I don't know
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation ah
mm
mm mm mm

oh okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious

ya lah I think design sizes it's it's all together mah like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd mm just see which one is um
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no lah as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles lah
mm mm
mm mm mm of course ya ya ya
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at melaka oh it's a very comfortable sweater

mm
mm mm
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures lah
ya except when I eat lah
orh
ya so there's there's rules and regulation lah it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
mm
ya must wear in case like people from the other um you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ah getting that lah
mm
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed oh my god
the below the eyes cannot make it lah ah
okay I don't mind going there
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
uh
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
arrow at work okay lah it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations

I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
aha

ugh
I'm just saying it works both ways
mm
ya
no they don't talk lah during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
ah so they know how to
ya ya ya ya ah ah
ya
ah
then like and then I'll be like
adela I
ah
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception leh and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then kan
ya
video
mashallah
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
mm mm
oi
oh really when
all the best girl
okay
oh my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
oh my god it was painful I was like just
oh my god
ah
feel so hurt
eh but it really hurts ah it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist lah
what do you mean by lube
oh lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that one they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay lah
ya
it depends lah like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
mm mm
ya so no worry lah I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check err about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just the reception's like madam fadilah I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
mm mm mm
ya
mm and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
ah Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say lah I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting ah
mm
mm mm
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
eh eh
mm
seventeen
mm mm
I I no okay lah I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya oh my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside lah
not strong ah
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
mm mm
ya
orh okay
I mean it's good lah then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball mah that's why
oh my god

very conservative ah mindset

it's like damn fun because it's like
um that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question eh sometimes cause
okay our kan like intern intern kan
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what ah
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
mm
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
mm ya maybe ah a bit of both
why blue do I look like a blue
okay cause orange kan is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic eh the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so I just chose orange lah at first I don't know but then
ya
serious
I think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise sia
ya
yup true
actually can
fly emirates
you know like you get what I mean
it's damn crazy
ya
I don't think I can
like I would rather
have like okay not flexible work but
I don't like that kind of
schedule
my body like need rest
ya
I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
no ah but
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan lah at least
then after that
okay so
um okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post what
so obviously there's fan
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon eh
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan what
I doubt it will open
ya I miss I miss going there then like talking to the kids even though they are annoying
but I don't miss the managers
sorry ah like
ya that voucher
but you got use or not
oh ya ah
but you can ask him to follow you what
right
you can ask him to
ya lah
can what
ah
then
ya
true
like starting okay maybe the first first few weeks
like know each other like know what are they supposed to do
like that's what I realised lah
ya so
after
mm ya ya
ya ya
that's why so
like what's his reason like
to go out
you never ask ah
oh my god okay
so right okay
ya okay so
okay err when I started um
maybe
ya last two weeks
okay okay so kan actually
ya okay so
err sarah said it's obvious lah and then I was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said um most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said you going out then I was like huh
what's mama's problem lah what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the err special child you know like
mm
like mix of both so like there's bad and good lah
like it's zeko's story but then how come zeko
told aisha then end up like mama know you know
huh okay then I was so pissed
so I went to expose one of aisha's secret lah
then after I exposed then after that err my mum was like
illegal gathering lah then I was like okay whatever
err mariam did you tell mama that
then she was like err mizi told me
so apparently she go text aisha eh she go text sarah she said
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
it's just zeko's ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
how to say ah like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
she
she go use my
like
I will throw your nike inside the water
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
err
huh
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
cause
I I won't say it's okay ah but
I don't know lah I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay lor but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm one then
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
no
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and aisha our shoe size is not that
like comfortable
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use lah but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then

mm
ah

we don't really get to see each other that often but I do have one or two few friends lah that I I'm actually looking forward to meeting
and err catching up lah
ya
ah no lah it's my main one lah my main major which is um biological science lah
um
um that
mm mm I I I wanna adventure more into the maritime sector lah and I by maritime you mean the the sea lah
in the future ya
ya
ya
oh
true lah
true
correct correct lah true
ya ya I
we together lah all of us are in a malay club so
ya
so during that
ya commitment issues lah
ya
ah
wah
ya
ya lah ya lah
oh
so ah her malay oral is coming up also so I've been helping her
err with malay oral lah
then err
aside from that
ya I mean the the least I can do is just like be there lah support her and then give her advice
then
ya she she has she seems she seems prepared ah
ya towards the later half of the year lah
same with close to loofy's birthday is it
ah
ya
ya ya nadia tried to err take up err what
the right the arts design and media in
err from the looks of it ah I don't think she got in lah
ya
ah ya the
the something about the diploma I think diploma in teaching
ya kind of sad lah cause she actually turned down her scholarship to try to go for the
ya
ya
ya
mm she's not really interested into like the business kind lah I mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like I think got good numbers lah graphs by by chart tax reform
all those jazz lah ya
ya
I try to
close to that lah similar similar stuff
ya
she will have fallback
ya
ya lah ya ya school starts when ah for you
oh
ya ya my the online semester starts first week of september we having like a welcome ceremony lah on the first of september itself so
it's all virtual lah a bit a bit boring but I mean
ya amsterdam
you know to watch soccer
then you watch people play cricket
true
ya lah not not my not my luck lah
ya
ya
it's getting worse lah in europe area
ya
ya err looking forward to it lah in the future
ah won't be anytime soon lah ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating lah from the university
I almost there lah I feel that already ya
ya
orh
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's err respectable lah for the craft of
ya
mm
ya understandable lah
oh ya ya she she's I think five months
so
time right
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited ah
ya
oh true true
near sharmin's birthday I think
nah who who who I mean
mm government lah they will know that is more than the allowed number ah so
ya it's going to be a small one lah only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
um
ah ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool lah cause they really understands uh their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce ah in the future we work
ah ah ya he's doing fine lah um
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time lah because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during err everyday day to day operations ya
mm
ya ya ya my my dad ah cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed lah beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
cause he's been doing delivery at the site ah to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
mm
ya school fee is quite expensive
mm I think really does a good job lah in ensuring that uh local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years err no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level seh ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five ah
mm
my sorry what
oh my girlfriend ah oh she's she's fine lah because ah she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it lah how ah it's very interesting
so they will err how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
ya ya in that type of uh
effect ya format ya
ah facebook facebook live
then uh she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her uh school of uh
mathematics
err they had a zoom
what they found out from her name ah
ya
I mean ah aren't we all sore losers some days ah
oh uh it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
ah she went out lah with her family cause err
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
I can request lah I mean the idea of contactless kan but
uh I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible lah because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so uh
what to do
ya recently err one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her
ya ya that close friend you met on err ya juliana

he is uh
he's work during our time before A levels ah
and then we ah
ya
ya usually one month also can apply but you want to apply now also can
mm
ya
it's where it's where is the best ah ya
they will still practice social distancing lah ya
ah
I honestly I haven't really went there because the next week is my first time so
I am looking forward lah to see how they will actually do this ah with the social distancing ya
ya
ya I mean since the the uh now they are trying to promote fist bump right so
ya

ya
he wanna pursue psychology or
sociology in that that sense lah
ya but ya
mm days were with him were the best lah because like you know me right I served
so like both of us um kind of like spend our time there together lah from the start

oh
ya correct lah I mean there's quite the huge distance lah
mm
ya correct lah true true
ah
that's not bad
ya
I don't know lah but that's what I see lah
ya
I see ah is is you want it you want to drink just to quest eh quench your thirst but not to
mm
ya cause I I got I make lah this err module in back when I was in my first year university
making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking lah
which is true lah ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke eh no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke I think ah ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much
it's because
you know eh
ya
correct lah correct
mm
ya ya true
but okay lah I mean now at least the general public has the idea lah that
mm
K lah
ya
drinking
oh ah nah man I
I kind of stopped drinking ah so
how about you man
ya ya that's nice that's nice
I
apple juice eh
oh
so
I will go for orange juices and carrot juice but my favorite juice will be the
ah lime juice ah
err well
ya my
how to say ah mine gonna like err
if you blend enough right the the whole drink will will come in well lah smooth
mm
oh
grapefruit ah
mm correct correct

a'ah
a'ah
um
um ya
ya uh um ya so
ya
wait wait wait
err
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two ah fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do ah the
err what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is um they having dementia lah but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
um
kid
ya I know
you know
mm
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
um
oh
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive lah because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing um
ah
ya
the mmhmm
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have um your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit eh two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has err I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya lah
mm ya
I think
mm ya mm
mm
mm
I'm not
that kind of thing then um then like then
a'ah
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
mm
oo
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
ah
mm
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient lah that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
mm
mm
mmhmm
you think you have
um next ah what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
a'ah
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me ah see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
ah swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
mm
it's like um
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the um for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
mm
mm mm
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy lah like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
ah
mm
mm so we know lah that communication is like the key to
mm
mm
mm
mm
phenomenon
oh okay lah
okay

stalisha
my day today is very tiring obviously um it's been two days ah I sleep very late
um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like wah
well quite nice lor
so
ya
but it was good though
mm
oh I see
oh
mmhmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mm
ya that's that's the thing
um usually people are afraid to set a price
um
we calculate our expenses ah and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see lah um like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like oh we can sell it from this price to this price no uh no lower than that
if it's lower than that um means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
mm mm
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not chai I don't like chai

for securing that
yes

cause they cause they base you based on your
sorry sorry can you repeat that again ah
err didn't get to hear clearly
mm
ya I would say that central area quite tame mah
ya
whether it's like err important or not ah it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was ah
ya but all in all
okay lah life
valuable lah ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
cause
mm
ya correct correct
mm
true true
ya
ya
but oh well that's
it was a good times ah back in the days

err you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this err my vicinity lah
correct ah
ah
I usually go for a minimum ten ah
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
ya
mm
oh okay okay
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
now I barely need a sip of water ah
ya
ya correct
mm
ya
the
cause if you drink too much then later your system
it's it's it's hampered with already ah so you need to stay stay clean ah
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
mm
ya correct correct
heatstroke ah heatstroke
mm
correct correct
you more vulnerable to heatstroke lah
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
kan
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
mm
ya
well
uh I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages ah but I've been uh
err a good a very good consumer of like err juices

two bottles lah

of juices ya correct

ah okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits ah
mm
wah
wah that's
I think that's err that's the right way to go ah to be honest
ah
oh serious
then
then is the texture smooth
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable lah but
you need to use a
good blender lah
ya I would say that lah
ya
ah
mm true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
um
but as for
err grapefruit
uh those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit ah
ya
so be smooth ah
sorry grape
ya different different
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut ah

ya
then look at him now ah
family man
hais time pass by so fast sia
today
so
in the morning I just stay at home
just listen to lecture
then
after that I stay home ah the rest of the day
lazy ah but nothing to do ah
I want find job eh
part time ah now still schooling what
but then
I don't know ah
eh I wish ah can go back there
thirty
like
it's legit seh it's like you never do guard duty before right
a
like when I do there is like leh really I work for two hours then I rest for four hours
then
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem
cause last sem last semester is everything was
so I can while I was working cause it's four hours rest what
al-ameen
I not sure seh I think around
I think until two three like that ah
if I not wrong ah
ya
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy ah
if if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there what correct or not
ya diet ah if cannot cannot exercise then diet ah
but I think I want to start back soon ah exercising
extreme ah
he he he
mmhmm
but then I don't know leh like I feel like
uh since I got the height already right
ya but
the effort ah and like
I don't know eh I feel like going gym
okay
like
I don't know ah like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
so but that stigma also like
a bit
a bit paiseh ah
but I feel like if I don't start like
eh you know I I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during
I skinny sia
okay
not not not skinny ah I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
I think hundred and four ah uh last time I checked was hundred and two
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two ah
I don't know eh my
cause since after right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five ah
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
so
not say maintain lah but uh after can order in already what so I always buy nasi lemak
ya
like before I know ah like towards the end of ah
cause army kan army the the longer
the superiors all will be ah
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat nasi lemak I eat Fatty Bom Bom
eh
Fatty Bom Bom free ah I want to eat ah
eh
watch your language man
woodlands have at marsiling
no no no no no no it's uh you know where marsiling is
it's it's opposite marsiling ah but not to the polyclinic side tau
you know you know marsiling got new shopping mall the where the police post is
towards the tracks
oh ya ya ya
but what's the difference seh
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that one is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name mah it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know ah
but
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom ah it's just like
no no no it's not at afghan there it's at
ya it's opposite dunman sec ah
then lia my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
like really like it's it's like
yio chu kang to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far ah
may half half the journey ah from yio chu kang to your house
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars ah
the
uh tampines one not so bad eh
I know
usually me and lia buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
usually I get the
cajun cajun eh cajun cajun chicken ah
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice ah the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken ah
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends ah some
you know some of the hawker centre ah
the western shop got like secondary school feels ah
Idah's Kitchen
I don't remember sia
is it the one the the thai shop take over ah
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
oh oh oh
I that one I thought that one is korean food what
oh I don't think I ate there before ah
now they got new one ah at Koufu
that kind of price ah
uh the
the whole range ah like you know chicken chop uh
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff ah
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it ah
usually they give like half bowl like that right
Koufu you know where the uh
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
but I not too sure ah maybe
japanese shop kan
eh
how lah I want to get better at DOTA sia
no eh but I play
it's like
if I get toxic opponent eh like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good ah
maybe ah maybe also
but I don't know ah
I don't know eh like
like
the genshin impact also cannot right
but okay ah nevermind ah because genshin like you can't really play with friends ah like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode ah
then you just explore the world yourself ah
then
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore ah
like the call it resin
so
you know ah so like uh this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge ah like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by lor then it recharge slowly
so it's mostly a waiting game ah like you finish
I don't know sia I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
like like really the game play is
fantastic ah phenomenal
but
I would say ah M I've play ah so far
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
ya so it's more of a waiting game ah so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term ah
ya true ah
oh
they spent like
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
I think maple ah cause this one is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already ah
like I I complete all the story mode already
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that ah
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already ah like
ya some more it's like
like
an advantage is advantage ah but like they make it minimal lor
since when I even watch soccer
I don't know ah like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word eh the
the attractiveness of watching soccer ah like it's just
so slow
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
you wait pass pass pass I don't know ah maybe just not my thing ah I guess
eh
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school ah
wanted to book ah
mm
I really not sure sia
I think the same week ah on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks ah
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
eh I do tomorrow already
it
eh I think they blacklist me already
where you where you uh where you plan on getting
APOL
uh huh I only know I only know Secret Lab ah
but then the pricing eh similar ah
like
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself what like it's not genuine leather right
ah
uh five hundred dollars on a chair
uh huh
huh
worth it ah got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site what
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this one must ask ah I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it ah
every other week
oh really ah
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
like
F&N pe F&N is like the standard ah the mm
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that eh uh basket
not basket ah they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
ya different
syrup also not a big fan ah
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established ah
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons uh uh the ice lemon tea is the blue colour one but they got the
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea ah but the blue colour one is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness ah ya the sugar
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
for for a while already ah
eh a'ah eh uh
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job ah dude
haven't ah but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know ah I just scared
like history repeat repeat itself ah
uh ya that's why
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much ah
so maybe not that bad ah
ya but like
in the one that pays well ah
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet ah
okay ah honestly ah
that time you work what no meh
ah
uh
oh
sheikh also work kitchen ah
oh
the one a
eh but that one also see your manager also ah
because
it's not really banquet ah but they set up for the banquet people ah
shang Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
I think so like who
oh yeah yeah yeah but
ah ya then this one is only for
like wedding reception only ah
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager ah so
the manager is like sheikh and that one also
uh like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay lah
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much ah
ya
ya
then I don't know ah I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends eh
uh
maybe
eh have you have you went to Fika before
ya eh the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is eh actually working title closed already it's beside working title ah
huh they work there
I cannot imagine rian at Fika though cause the people there are like really
how to say ah I don't know ah I can't imagine rian there
like aidil aidil I still can see him ah working at Fika but rian a bit hard ah to imagine him working there
eh but the food there the food
the eh the ambiance all
top notch ah
like work there also I think swee
eh the food
oh I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause uh my friend tell me their service there is like top notch ah
but then my friend say ah like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get ah
worth it lah ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend ah
oh
ah ya
I want to try ah but like
where is it ah I never knew where it was eh
but it's at bugis also
but then mm
but then the price ah start dating
ugh you scared what must pay for her ah
this
sad face
uh I thought you say you got beef with akshay
eh got beef with both the boyfriend and the girlfriend ah
uh beef is on
eh ya lah I think I want to watch
ugh
cause
no cause it's not a proper show it's like
mm ugh uh
uh no no no okay
but their storyline is all connected I think that's what The Real Bros is ah
ya uh key and peele established already ah
they got this new video ah what what was it eh uh
eh which one was it eh key and peele
it's the newer one to come out
uh
uh uh oh the jaden smith one
then you should uh uh you should watch it ah the jaden smith one funny
that time I watch with shah
car park ah
ah ya ya cause you were late ah
eh how you want to plan now or not meet with sundair
no ah
last month ah
don't say like that what makes you
ya
rehan why rehan
ha funny guy rehan
eh then how later later want to play DOTA
I play for a while ah
uh
I want to get better don't know
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress ah
valorant is not sia actually it's quite realistic what is like same as almost go but
only the suit like a bit
eh how
are you are you buying the five or not
oh
uh
ya like the first console I owned was
ugh cause okay
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing ah
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
ya so
then after that eh you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my
eh eh no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal lah like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three ah so like I never really believe them ah
uh wouldn't say well lah like
so so ah A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's okay ah above average ah slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know ah one day I just come home eh
then turns out one was for me ah one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted I wanted game boy what
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no ah but wasted ah cause my parents bought when it first came out
so it's one thousand
ah
ah ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my the slim one come out
ya
but then that the closest to console I got ah
ya but actually the games there quite good sia
ya
ah
I think take over ah the market
Vita Vita Vita ya ya ya
downfall lah ya
then I
but I
I think
ya it's like
ah that one is a Pokemon brand already ah
until now right ya Switch
got other games ah
ya don't know ah
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked ah don't know ah this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing ah
ya
the uh he got post on Twitter ah I got see a picture of his uh like office like that
I think
publicity ah like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that what
got a
probably that one also not he play ah maybe his team play for him ah
ya
hais
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice leh
like I okay this one is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular ah
adventurer concourse I forget ah
it is ah it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
uh medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself ah
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war is what ah
is it
oh no no no
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from lah
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget ah uh
I wah I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side ah
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
err uh quite cool ah
I forgot what's the name of the game ah
plazma burst
mm
isn't that just uh
escape room
and then there's a ghost chasing you
oh is it
I'm not sure ah
farid all ah
skipper
aiman
aiman
oh I don't know ah I never see ah they post on twitter ah
okay lah not bad lah he was top top in singapore ah one point of time
then your
for that hero will increase
ah so like uh he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again ah
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore ah
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands yishun ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's uh asian server ah
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in johor top in selangor top in sabah that kind of thing
ya that's why
singapore is one state ah singapore is a state what it's a state country right
uh
out outdate outdated information ah that one
okay I can say also lah
hais
mmhmm
how you know
of course lah
mm
the malay eh actually this one I can ask my friend lah you know khai
ah she very interested in like malay culture and all that lah so like
I do research on it also
on it but khai like he can tell me like
oh got this guy
he travel with uh columbus
around the world
so ah he say it's a malay it's a malay guy ah that travelled with columbus to find out that the world is round
ya
he research about all these ah
um
like um got
uh
how to say eh
in power ah
like they
uh
then they defend all themselves
quite cool ah when you
when you hear the story
haig road
steak
eh
burger got another YouTuber ah I forgot what's his name ah sam the burger guy ah something like that
that one also he makes swee ah like proper american burger
not so fat ah like around guga size also
but he a bit redneck vibes ah
ah I don't remember he wear specs ah
uh huh
so like if you
that one I not sure maybe now cause he quite big already kan maybe he can get sponsors ah but at the start I'm pretty sure I think he buy himself ah
like you know it's like he just very passionate about cooking
from japan all like you see there's
the knife all very nice and very sharp
I got see knife restoration lah
eh but keep samurai sword like cool ah in singapore

okay tell me about your what are you doing currently
mm mm mm
for me ah mm
okay I'm working at like uh as an admin at tuition centre lah then err
uh the hours are not very long for me I think it's not very hard also and the pay wise is okay for me also it's not very tiring also ya lah
uh that's for weekdays lah then weekends like I get like ten dollar per hour so I think it's okay
ya
but the hours like
mm mm mm
any complaints uh any any situations that happen that you can share
ah
ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
citing play any place that thesis my senior
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
you all
you all straight up ignored him or what sia
oh damn
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
suited switches waited until like someone call him to
mm mm mm mm
your max ah
ah ah ah ah
ya lor in my opinion also I feel like
ya
ah ah
ah ah ah ah uh huh uh huh uh huh
okay lah but if you're working in this sector you need to expect this kind of people also
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
what parents
I mean I'm quite lucky lah right now they my my my tuition centre the parents are all quite okay not really those demanding ya they're all chill
but I mean I mean they're bound to face this kind of
bad parents also but I think overall is okay like
what I want I wouldn't complain anything about it lah everything is everything is gucci
ya ya
so what you're planning to do for your full time now
mm mm mm
ah
what kind of careers can you like get from this course though
freelance is it
oh cool okay
which
ah which company
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm oh ya but during your course of study got intern or not ah
so mm
is that related to your course though
ah ah
mm mm mm
your cup of tea
mm
ah mm mm mm mm
mm oh the standards is not very high there
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
words mmhmm
mm
doing mmhmm
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard lah for you right
mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm understand understand
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
culinary
mm
ya that's true
mm mm mm
uh huh
ya it's true mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
ah but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
fun things like what
mm ya
mm oh ya all these are all affected
mm
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
mm
mm mm mm
but also depends on each person lah because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that one can affect us like a lot
err yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya
mm
mm
like I feel I feel like as we age ah and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm ya I understand
mm hmm mm
mm mm mm
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way lah but it's just slow
mm mm mm oh my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
mm
mm our blessings
mm mm mm ya
ya ya ya
mm mm mm
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right mm mm mm
a change lah
progress
mm mm mm
mm
close minded lah
mm mm mm
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue ah about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional lah due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that one is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
mm mm
thinking
mm
mm
mm mm mm ya
mm mm
mm mm mm
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that one actually like kind of assured me
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
what
ah flaws
uh huh
you know what same girl
bedok ah ah
actually I never try before
mm
mm
mm
mm
I've been wanting to try that though I've always seen people post like this online
what do they sell though western is it
mm
ah I'm craving for pasta now
mindset
you started it
ya we have to eat
okay lah porridge I had a breakfast I mean to me I like ah but I think
I mean not really I mean um I think my taste buds more of the older people kind of kind of taste buds ah but
I mean I'm not really a porridge eater but this porridge is not bad ah
kind of one of the top one I mean not top but one of the good ones
mm it's been long is it
but I thought you work early one you don't have time to get this meh
wait so when you work you start at eight correct
ten minutes for the whole shift
eight to five right
uh huh
mm oh
you should have girl
oh that's true
you're not a morning person
mcgriddle oh ya oh you like that
ah it's not a fixed menu ah
I don't know to make people want it lah
to me personally I feel like it's too heavy eh for my liking
huh you eat light you will not heavy
wrong with you ah
ah
huh that's so god damn weird
ya ya the egg and the cheese is there cheese in it
oof god damn stop it girl we hungry
oh I don't know that one I'm not sure
anyway tell me about yourself like like how you from
from secondary school from primary school until poly like we met in poly correct
we met in poly and then I mean I didn't think we had a chance to get to know each other also
like we mostly met for like
ya for our tasks and things to do not at our own timing so like I think we can take this chance to like you know
anywhere you can start ah anywhere you can recall
wah sis you know my my memory sucks lah so
I don't know girl anywhere
mm
oh
ya so I announced it go you know okay ya such as
so how many years of floorball did you play
four years oh from sec one eh
wow
wow
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
how
mm
oh my god
mm I know I know I know
I keep it out they are used
mmhmm
oh my god
ah
ah
did it actually work
so what you bring it for your practices ah
uh huh
then
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
but in school you use the school stick ah
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
oh so in the end you still bought lah
class fund
oh eh ah
edusave eh
ah
mm mm mm mm mm
mm
so you prioritise the uh
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
oh there's two floorball teams
mm
mm
oh so you improved a lot ah
mm mm mm mm
mm
mm
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
ah
mm
mm
did they like dislike you
hatred ah oh acceptance from that
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
to join you lah
mm mm mm
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things lah like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas ah
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you ah so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay lah so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it what
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
mm
the floorball is it
mm
mm
mm
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
mm
mm mm mm
get through with it
uh huh ah ah ah ah
mm
mm
mm
oh so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh math was the only one you failed
but
oh okay
mm mm mm mm mm
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear sia
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it lah if not it's like really tiring for you
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
oh floorball
that is going to affect your grade more sia
exams
oh my god O-level
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a um
really
mm
mm
mm
really
mm
mm
mm
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before lah in singapore ah like a popular way
weird why
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
ah oh ya
oh ya we had the camp
huh
really
vibes ah
mm mm
but I think we achieved quite
a lot lah from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember sia
mm ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head ah but I think executing part ah
that one is not for me ah
that's true
mm
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw lah
why ah
oh oh why though ah
why ah
oh ah ya ya ya
ya sia haiya
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
tertiary is what secondary ah
oh primary secondary or poly ah
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was aite but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me lah
so I would choose the primary school lah cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from ahmad ibrahim at yishun
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in ahmad ibrahim for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that uh I moved to serangoon so I had to transfer myself so I went to pei hwa at sengkang
so that was when I had like
so eh no pei hwa was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at sengkang
so that was where oh wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at ahmad ibrahim right I joined
err skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there ah and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that one and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport lah
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping eh so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow lah
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper ah that one
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went ah
ah I think so
I think so but I really forget sia I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that err okay that's all then my primary school was
err skipping lah then after that I went to anchorgreen sengkang
and then that's at sengkang and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
ah
ah no we have three types of dances all
ah we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing lah so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones one I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
ah ya lah those lah ya just for fun
really
from what like
just like interest uh huh
personally I feel free styling is like
hard sia for me
mm mm
because it's up to you also what right ya
okay
ah
err for me I don't know eh I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand eh this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
ah
uh I think I don't know ah I mean if like one person do on her own ah I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay ah
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban lah like
I don't understand the nice to it lah hip hop that's like that's like nice ah I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
oh I even joined a kayaking uh competition
and ya in
polys ah I mean organised it
but it was secondary school err but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite err like an achievement for us ah
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that err then we got
kayaking and stuff oh there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things ah like those like
err camps and shit and stuff is normally with eh so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay lah cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
err secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers ah I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like meh so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
oh ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course lah
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful lah the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but meh not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school lah
poly like not really eh maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me lah ya
mm actually I did ah but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
mm there's no design meh
mm
mm mm
wow okay mm okay okay okay okay
I didn't know uh uh media is like so enhanced like so many things
mm mm mm mm
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
mm
oh like you the posters and stuff lah
ah
oh oh cool cool cool
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
is up to you
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm
then you should like work for like those mm shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing what no meh
mm
mm mm
mm mm then you should open a YouTube channel
why
mm mm
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
mm mm mm mm
ya I also just realised that sia
culinary was really just because of the coffee part lah really
actually ah if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know eh honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know sia
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places lah hor
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide ah
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now ah they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
mm mm
mm
mm ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says eh like err experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like uh signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni one honestly
so I don't know lah so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
wow
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like err capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya huh
mm
mm mm
mm ya
mm mm mm
mm
mm
but I think that's what makes up a person ah a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
mm mm
ah we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true

hello
yes
okay
so
hais
there goes our effort early
anyway
just
find something new then

velocity

mm
mm
so
ah
and
and what will be another twenty
laid back
more chillax
chillax
ya
what if it's really really apocalypse ah
nonsense kan
ya kan
ya circuit breaker
like I think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
ah
okay ah err
spending sia
big land to
to play around to to run around
ah
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
ah
till it go into phase one
and then yes
um lively ah
ah
ah
but ya
but I think during err
wow
err
ah
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have um
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then um
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown ah and then ya
perspective you can be
right I mean
but we we are alright with that we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
the effects are there lah you know
err I don't think
kan
more of err like going through a war
not not like before this you know
constantly err doing things
be it err
err
you know all being um
stopped I would say that
ya
or or or the environment
of going through eh err things um
ah the things that we do
is err not doing very well right
they had an industry and the thing is
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
ugh
ya ya ya all the big err bars club
um
chill a little bit and them um
see what's going on and then from there
err
come to a point whether
and what not
time um everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
uh for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not um
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
um
it was haywire napster coming in you know
ah it was for for for consumer they will like it ah
but people who produce it people who
who you know
mm you know big err movie affected by
whack or or or
or just like um be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light there will be light
um
apart from that probably um
share it because ya

ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
ah ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
okay ah I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use ah
like you can't really copyright that shit
eh fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
err ya I think that's different
mm fair
oo ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad sia
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already sia considering like
okay lah okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
ah uh huh
err it's like five in india
somebody copy eh copyrighted ah ya copyrighted ah
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably ah I think
probably will try to buy it off the person ah
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
one two three four
ah ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
oh four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya lah you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create ah create ah you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay ah it was rocky ah
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better ah
I mean it's just a brand name only ah at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like oo look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive ah but then it's like
eh ah no I'm not about that life man
man
no ah not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya lah I mean it is a gaming peripheral ah but still like
at least limit it ah like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like oh Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that one by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
eh that kind
ah
with my current night shift
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this one is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like oh my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay lah like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the one that you are looking at this the second one
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit lah like
whoever ah whoever say something right then err or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job ah and then like cannot ah
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring siol
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya lah no lah leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
uh I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can ah but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay ah depends on the company lah but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense ah but
the travel expense though it's free
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right ah I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance ah you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything ah
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can ah
let anyone use the thing
sial ah I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me ah
no lah it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like eh there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like err if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
uh all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras ah
like I'm just saying there's
there's uh
hidden thing to it lah like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply ah
no ah
like where the hell am I supposed to go sia if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can ah can is can ah like the
I mean the
no ah
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the oops room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
uh I mean it's true ah I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that one then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before lah but
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this ah job
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like sial ah where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
uh ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is ah but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
ah zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya lah
eh no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days siol I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
okay ah not really okay ah
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that lah like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what uh
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
uh I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay ah
eh but then new zealand that time got uh recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive ah
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see lah what happened now
three hundred thousand already
uh huh
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see eh go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like sial ah
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit sia like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
oo
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest what so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya lah I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only ah I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything ah
ya
okay
really
uh huh
oh is it
ya borat is borat lah so
I wonder if they edited that out
uh huh
I mean to be okay ah no ah
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is ah but you know it's fucking video proof ah like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
uh they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know lah which state ah one of the judge lah they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is ah
ah
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for taiwan soon
I think world war three should start soon
err china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to taiwan right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit taiwan ah
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
eh ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
taiwan is part of china and then
I mean ya lah like
and they could have just let taiwan
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of taiwan like no
I think they call them uh D D C P right eh no D C C
oh wow
I mean taiwan is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay lah
that one no comments ah ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
uh huh
uh huh
legit ah
oh wow
uh huh
ee ah ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also lah
kan
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
oh speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay ah it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
kan I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
ah
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that lah but okay ah there are the backwater parts ah
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
sial ah
uh huh
it's basic human nature lah what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you eh
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya lah
okay
uh huh
okay
wow
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions ah
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is ah it's his style
either way it eh no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe eh
we might as well be
kim jong un
oh my god I don't know ah sia
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
and that that is trump in a nutshell lah eh
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lagging
oh wow
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care ah
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that one terrible siol like
only essential workers what
me ah
then like yours truly ah
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
they got
it's not even that much sia
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like sial ah they can sial ah that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period sial ah how to earn fifty sia
okay ah not not everyone can ah but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight sia
he live somewhere ah there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book eh same guy tomorrow eh same guy
and like okay ah ten minutes only what not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
like unless on that day I overslept or something
rare ah but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no ah
it was at boon lay
don't know call call message
everything no reply
siol then I like what the fuck sial wait here half an hour already siol then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing sia cancel
no ah
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already sia
kan
just cancel get a new one
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
uh
okay lah ya there's there's the more apt way to say it lah
you collect the food already
then you put delivered
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
oh ya ya ya ya
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
hmm
ah
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift what
like rare you find
that that one is dorms
eh well
service industry lah eh
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit ah you get that kind of shit ah
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it ah
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night ah
cause
mm
ah
okay lah I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
there's only one entrance and one exit lah so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell ah got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
then provided you got exact change
I'm helping do your job
but ya I mean that that period ah
the the one that people were all in panic
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you eh not the six hundred no
one point five litre
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
ah
like okay ah if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand ah but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like eh siala
this thing ah like that like that like that
then like
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more

uh huh
ah yes correct correct
mmhmm
ya
how how does how does it work
in the new uh version
okay
mm mm
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice ah there's no uh you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can err
do according to your preferences ah
ah okay so there's no like
four four two
mm
mm
so in order for me to play
for example tiki-taka I cannot have a
uh anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my uh my formation is flick enough for the tiki-taka or
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference ah like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what lah
so for the
players also
mm
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and uh
mm
mmhmm
okay
ah okay okay okay so
they have their own uh attitude lah and uh they have their own attitude when facing the
ah each games ah
mm
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
ah
if I'm not wrong eh uh the last
that's that's long sia
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year sia last year or last two years
so I eh correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be ah fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
oh the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
ah ya
oh I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out ah so if okay if I am going to download it
ah
okay
Acer uh you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that one I think I quite lost already
ah K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
okay lah so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
ah okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
ah
ya I know I know I know
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
I have ah eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth ah
I don't want jagged jagged uh you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
ah
ah
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also uh got twenty touch
ah
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
a'ah
that's a
that's stressful
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people ah cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror ah kan but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
ah
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say ronaldo cristiano ronaldo
okay from juventus to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
ah okay
ah
okay
mm
ah okay okay okay
okay
so okay ah dortmund sancho is the english guy is it okay okay
mm
let's say let's say
this sancho is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
ah
mmhmm
mm
okay
okay
this social group is
very important lah actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
mm
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games ah
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
ah
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
port for it
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know lah I I
ah
I I mean I I know about the the the
mm
ah
ah ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
mm
it is intensive ah okay but anyway
okay ah maybe after this then I will give it a try ah
okay lah we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
look left look right
look look see see lah that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
mm
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
mm
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the ah twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
ah so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
eh eh how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have sia god damn it four more days okay ah nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine lah maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
prime minister lee hsien loong announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like haris harun still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
ah
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians pe is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
mm
ah I mean
ah
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible pe
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
a'ah
okay
okay
mm
so okay ah
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see ah
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see eh when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
mm
I mean you can ask juventus how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that one is their what italian one is it
oh okay
okay
mm
mmhmm
oh that's so
wah
ya correct
mmhmm
ah yes yes
mm mm
ah okay I mean
well that's
err when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
cause there were
mm mm
there is know the
even below north south
time for them to just you know what
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole ah
ah
ah
ah that's why
ya
ya but
day
I mean technically if everyday
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
err physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger ah
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger ah I'm the privileged one as compared to
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
CISCO CISCO oh that's almost seven years
ah
six seven six seven years I never play
oh anyway if you want to know ah five aside
ah
ah
ah
ah
I mean that's a good idea ah
I mean true
you want to be
ah
mm
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently lah uh after army
I don't catch up already cause know
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say eh
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true ah
to ah
well I mean
like what
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
mm
if you notice
eh he cannot speak tamil pe
then he shouldn't
mm
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
mmhmm
uh huh
nobody dubbed over him kan
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say vanakam for thirty times ah for for thirty minutes pe I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
english
of course ah
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see ah my my
grandfather my
basically all the old people ah
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me lah so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
ah the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
mmhmm
okay
a'ah
mm
a'ah
mm
mm
ah
mm mm
okay
okay
ya correct
mm
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this uh
not say rider ah this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from johor to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who um who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
mandarin or tamil lah if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent ah and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right wah this is very confusing ah
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true pe
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish ah no sia
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
but
I suspect
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
mm
so how
a'ah
mm
okay
you you agree pe okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say lah how
ah
ya that's why
ah
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian pe
okay but you you understand what I trying to say pe
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
mm
ya
I mean ah there there is a I think there's a occasion pe there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
yet he's always interrupting us oh by the way ah
mm
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
err right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
mm
ah
okay okay
ah coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
that one for what eh
okay
okay
okay
mm
ah ah ah
ah that is quite long tau
ya actually a lot of things changed ah
but it's nice
ah ya lah
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot lah I mean it's so so constricted lah this place to be honest
uh twenty twenty four seven
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a ah there is a schedule
ah
ah now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september pe you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already tau
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
mmhmm
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
just for maintenance ah
mm
ya I know I know
I mean
wow that sucks
mm
ya ya
I mean just like that eh
err
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone sia
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or
it already
keep it up
picking up already
ah
mm
I mean ya lah ya lah there
will go back
to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything lah but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
ah
ah ya
okay
ah
now that's a very interesting concept
ah
ah ah
mm mm
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think ah but
but uh I mean if we see uh
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our ah and
ah
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry pe
the the thing is does it work though
