okay
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on ah
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
so I say that to him lah
mm
so they were looking for people to debate lah like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
ah I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate what
so uh
err I
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
mm
seriously ah
okay
okay we don't talk about lah eh
is err
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
uh huh
ah right
that's the thing ah
even
but government allow sport activity what
ah
so I call this guy he's known for speaking ah good malay
uh to mix we always mix
ah
a'ah it's very standard ah
err okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have err
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay lah let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
oh my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
mm ah okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
ah alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my err future lah
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
ah be a professional sports player
okay
uh huh
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer lah cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
err but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
ah so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money lah
ah
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific lah but
Singapore soccer is a no no lah
all macam haziq
ah that's a bit unrealistic the passion is uh actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of err
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life lah
ah
alright
sorry
ah true true Malaysia pay better
um
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower ah
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport ah
anywhere and everywhere
wah so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late lah I don't want to be late lah
ya so for example ah
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
mm
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching ah
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about lah
ah
it is an emotional story
um sad
but
no it's a series series
mm but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
hmm
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
oh
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class ah in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well err in primary school
ah because
um
how to say eh
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no lah I mean that that's the problem ah because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have err you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
ah play soccer at the void deck all lah so
I will change my mindset lah but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this ah cliche phrase
it's true ah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example ah that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like wah
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song ah kan maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
ah
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders ah basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start eh you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song ah
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because ah there was this video playing that song ah so like oh not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K ah I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like oh ya eh nice song nice song ah
so it's damn annoying ah actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the lah
okay lah okay lah we cannot throw shades lah okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
mm
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
um
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries ah will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
mm
ya
precisely
mm mm mm
that's a sensitive uh topic
okay
let's see next question eh
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do mm very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds lah
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
um rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need ah okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and ah okay basically iphone is good lah those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
um shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at pasar malam
and then
shoe uh twenty thousand lah
you know ah Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
ah bought a very expensive car lah
uh so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like eh you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like oh okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money lah
you want to show off
and all
give me their money lah I can put to better use
okay oh yes sorry
mm
uh
but people just live to complicate it
ah
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face lah
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do lah right
alright next question
oh this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours oh my god
oh my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say ah everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different lah
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like eh so there's now two shops eh
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food lah outside food the look is so important
mm mm
and
mm
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got ah
hopefully
oh you know what I just want to come lah
um next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
err oh okay okay oh okay okay
okay hmm
oh okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone eh sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
mm
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face ah
okay I wouldn't say expert because
err I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right lah
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on lah it was like what blonde
then I was like
ah see ah this one ah
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit ah
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
ah the
eh don't do this lah
you know what I mean you are like come on lah you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but kena our
you wanna get expelled is it
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
um okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
um
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
um
can ah but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is err
skill eh
maths
ah I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths ah maths ah like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of uh discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me ah
ah
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
mm
mm mm
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good lah they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
alamak cannot search ah
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning lah
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events oh basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny lah okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding ah a serious scolding ah
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
ah
I mean
it's hard lah it's hard
yeah
damn but
oh my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss lah definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it lah eh let's not throw shade to people lah eh
but oh my god I miss our class with
uh ham boy
S&W
uh
you only spend time when ah
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you lah
like that we really sit down and talk
ah
ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was ah
ah
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time lah
ah
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
um graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay lah
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
err
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
ah
and I have better options ah I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do ah to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that what you know what I mean
like giving
so
true lah true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free ah
cause I'm laying low a bit
ah I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things lah in the future
mm so you can actually come down
three more right
mm
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
huh
fifteen minutes fifteen ah serious expressway
mm mm mm mm mm in Singapore you wanna rev come on lah
you throttle abit beep
kena fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
um
let me think ah
it it seems good right
oh
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one lah
what happened
oh your wifi seems abit bad lah eh
okay lah I think we go next question ah it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves lah ah not to other people lah
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that lah this I guess this my fate lah
so if
in the past yeah fit body now ah
whatever god give me I'll take lah
like uh whatever it is lah good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again lah
like know because
ah but oh my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body lah like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot eh
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying lah because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team eh
the best is usually the fastest
ah but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst ah offensively
ah
so
but I have to keep up with those uh because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not um
used to it ah like I'm not exposed to it what
ah
mm mm mm mm yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal eh
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house lah because free what
right
oh chicken rice for the win bro
funny ah you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore chey
oh I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
ah
kampung chicken they make sure it's from a
not say kampung lah but you know kampung means they bring it up naturally
ah it it it you don't have to worry about the
others lah
uh
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival what the basic survival need
eh
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe ah I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya wah I mean
true lah true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
uh system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict ah
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
ah
correct
mmhmm
um
wah
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
um
like uh
only for pioneer generation lah
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
ah
must use the ah reservation booking
yeah
uh whether they have space or not and but come on ah
the
this is the problem right find solution lah
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who ah
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is lah ah
so we just have to take care of ourselves lah that's why you know ah like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot ah like
actually we don't have to go out always
ah but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay lah you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
ah
correct
ah
ya because K want to lepak okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
ah
it is prone to have problems
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay lah
nothing much
ah
no
mmhmm
seriously
then later when the number of cases spike then everyone panic so
no comments lah this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be lah eh
we don't have much say but
okay lah I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people lah
but
ah
I don't appreciate it
seriously firework is overrated for me
like
okay
I could just create this using my computer
you know what I mean
but I it it's just me lah I don't appreciate it lah I appreciate doing I'm all for doing kind of than seeing kind of guy
like you bring me to the most beautiful country with the best place to sightsee I would appreciate
like you bring me to a country with the best theme park I would go
ah
correct correct
okay that's different lah that's different lah bali nah
nah
but normal normal asia bro it's europe
or south america bro
okay lah if you talk realistically ah you want to go to europe also you have to go to the europe safe country lah Turkey
ya
they they handled the situation quite well
based on what I heard lah because you see ah like
U ah they are very big hit
ah so it's quite worrisome to go there ah
mm
greenland
no
mm mm mm mm
is it greenland or iceland ah that has no army
don't have army yeah one one one of this wait also one of this country don't have mosquito
I think it's greenland
because you see ah it's so err
precisely greenland got ice iceland is green
legit ah
oh oh oh oh oh
oh okay
mm
mm why
I don't know why didn't you apply for it
but it is still available ah still available lah
go for it bro go for it bro
in times of crisis we need
if you can get if you need help we have to
get whatever we can lah
but don't beg
yeah
ah yes yes yes
I off all the light
and my window is closed ya
hundred three sixty degree
from always awake
I'm a morning person now

even the going away party I I want to be selfish I just want it to be us I know I'm I know I sound so selfish but
ya
ya
but inclusive of err house owner
ya
um like the five of us just a separate one lah I think she will appreciate that okay ya ya
err ya just more of a
ya it was supposed to be the ninth whatever
ya
ya for me I think it's more of
just ah iskandar I think they if you see like ah anything that is pertaining to family ya or the family like she won't really like
say out you know I think ya I think and that's that
ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first nisa I know
that hung out at like ah sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk nisa
pissed drunk it used to be like err you want some ah no no it's okay thank you now it's like ah where's the cigarette yana where's your cigarette
aiyo that girl
know that day like err the staycation lah with me ah it's my birthday ah
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
tini
no to tini to tini so
no so it's not that um
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told tini
pizza
so sarah
no she and I and I told tini tini
um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
nisa did nisa did
eh nisa did and then I I put also eh tini we miss you ah we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that what
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
I I will never do things like that
hurt
ya
ya right ya
so ya lah
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
even even with nisa sometimes you know like ah I'm not comfortable ah talking about it like good then I'm like great nisa thank you like no I respect that
ya
it's an asian thing also ah
ya wait I
ya I think we need to learn more to just be unapologetically have boundaries
you know like no lah ya

wow I'm so proud of you
wow
alright okay

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see
okay
wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
ah both ah
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
but I mean it's a bit late for for prata simpang bedok ah
you don't know mahamoodiya

oh what was the last movie you watched on netflix
mmhmm
oh
house
don't know
oh it's a comedy
mm haven't watch it
wah
true
ya that's true
huh oh
ah
I think the last movie I watched was movie eh I haven't watch movies in awhile but I watch like series
ya
the acting is not that great the the also not that great lah but
no it's british ya
it's quite interesting lah I mean the storyline also not that amazing but it passes time
ya
the boys
on netflix
oh
oh
mm
oh
okay
mmhmm
mm
mm
like what what's the storyline about like what basically happen
okay
amazon prime I don't have sia but might I might subscribe cause got a lot of like interesting shows I've heard and netflix is like running out of stories
isn't much left
ya
amazon prime
orh
ya
mm
interesting
mm
I know you take forever to watch a show
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm true
mm
I think they did it was like fourteen the last time now it's like sixteen
oh great
haiya it went up
ya they added now
ya
mmhmm that day I received this
ya but I don't know ah I think not yet
true
mmhmm
oh
oh wow
what is it about
but what is your course like mainly about
huh okay
oh yes
I mean that's fun I guess managing a business
mm
uh huh
mm that's true
I don't know
I mean
oh ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
oh how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
mm
mm
then what happens
true
mm mm
mm
but like
sad sia they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market uh like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game eh without the players what do you have like an empty online page
mm
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
and that's what has been happening what like the
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
kan
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
ya
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that lah
ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
it's probably him ya
I don't know sia
ya and he spent so much on that game also what I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
oh ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want sia
I don't know

so but ya that's it
what what should be free

but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
ya let's go look for that cow later
is there
interesting we go find out lah
kan
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
oh
I mean the
I mean there's still one that exists that like
she owns the place basically and then like uh
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened lah when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
mm ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like oh I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then ah they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall lah and then like um
her features were like pretty lah like
like a model person's features
mm that part that was the one lah
ya
mm ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying lah cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
then we just like like we told them lah like oh we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place ah cause it's surrounded by
that hut that looks like a kopitiam
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor lah
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
oh visit huh there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
the there's a road that goes through the entire place lah so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people lah
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like paiseh ah cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
and then um
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
ah but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice ah it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
um
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting ah the place
interesting
um
I honestly don't know ah I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night lah
ya I think same ah if like I had to like
true
but
oh ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
mm
mmhmm
really
that's interesting
uh the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes sia is it even open I think it is already lah if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
pulau semakau that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent lah ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
orh orh
catty
catty enclosure
mm
and jumping on things
mm
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed lah like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible lah to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age sia the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from yishun
yishun has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not meh
it was
it was lah cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
uh five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya sia
sec four lah so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
orh
it's quite pretty lah the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and changi airport
hmm
that's a hard question
but legit lah like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
oo
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
hmm
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job oh my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
mmhmm
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
mm
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
oh ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
mm
ya previous
mm money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
mmhmm
mm
so what the hell
wow
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
oh
mm
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
mm
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it ah so like
probably not
mmhmm
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
mm
mm
no one was interested
ya
mmhmm
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay lah to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
mmhmm
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like oops
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
mm
mm
mm
true
mm
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
mm
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
orh
same
I just I cannot imagine like
oh
I was like huh
ya
oh that's weird
the hell
mm
mm
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
orh
mm
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
mm
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad lah like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it lah but like it's fine uh it's fine lah he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
oh really
orh
I mean get scared lah like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine lah like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
mm
mmhmm
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic what then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die lah confirm but like
oh
mm
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
mm
is put to use
ya
mm
somewhere else
that needs it
mm
mm
mm
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
ah ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
oh well
ya sia and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical sia like how
why
mmhmm
are we
bye bye

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it
mm
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private kan the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's
two point
and the two points is unlimited or I thought there's a limitation kan
alah commoner
two point two point two point
fuh
outside one ah
non spicy ah
regular is meat ah mixed with
bring a bottle I have a lot of your bottles at home sia I think I have four five bottles at home
phone not working ah
kaki bukit siol lah
probation shit
you know she went around asking everyone whether I'm finding a new job
this this was this was when COVID
wait wait wait you were there at until what time so your prac ended at ten fifteen ten fifteen
she don't smoke ah
then
mm
okay
mm mm
correct correct
burger
mm
mm mm
ya lah she got a car
this year oh last year
oh this year
ya lah ya lah
head of customer service
they went to use the company funds what I told you
so so they what they did was
they they ordered a pre order meal okay for after nine
so they will go to the back in I mean we we have everything what we have all the access to do it
you go to the system the change the timing to now
so it's free food lah and they've been doing it for I don't know how long ah
dishonest ah
that is it will look bad ah sia I on your profile
speaking of which
because back then uh
deliveroo APAC office was beside youtrips office
in uh robinson road
so whenever they had trainings they don't have to go there where so at that point of time me and shida was was still okay lah and then you know we were talking and stuff
then uh every time
dayah was there
last year
and I dayah even smoke with us and everything
dayah smokes what
a lot of times ya a lot of times
ya
and she's she's only about twenty nine
makeup
what did you tell her what what did you tell her
huh serious you said that ah
when was this
is it
youtrip slightly toned down ah but
same
so it was just nice when I call you ah
is it
you had to think eh
ya correct ya
mm
ya
okay
legit
the contract
oh ya ya ya ya
so you went to work first and then you interviewed later kind of stupid shit is this
mm
oh okay okay I get it I get it
who ask you
then
mm
I don't know I I I've lost contact
subtle
mmhmm
because because I mean how I find out was I shared with her a lot of things she go and pao
there are things I didn't like about the the whole how they

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

okay
eh I need

then on top of that they charge you extra eh for like per menu item
that's not bad
that's right
uh
ah ya ya okay I know I know that one not bad
it was like FatBoy's ah it's I think more or less the same eh but
their menu all like

Fatty Bom Bom is like
would you rather Fatty Bom Bom or
those typical western stall at the hawker
ya
ya ya okay I get what you mean like poly one lah the one you know beside the
the Idah's Kitchen
or the indian indian stall
you know the western stall is quite famous eh you know like at first they had the store in right then after a while it closed down
remember
uh no no it's like
you know the that stretch right
it's the last the first shop near the drinks stall
that one to the end
not last stretch the first you know that stretch right it's the first stall closest to the
drink stall
ya before korean it was western it's uh mother and son uh partnership
huh serious wah that one is damn good man and it's like also pretty cheap also like
I think normal platter like say chicken chop ah only four fifty or what
with two sides
uh
what's that chicken chop
mm
uh
ya ya ya that's the thing about school um food I feel even if the price they say not say
um cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside
oh it's too much ah
mm
no no they don't
ya ya ya
oh okay I think I know I know but I never eat never tried it
oh
ya correct
ha play ah more you can play more pub games ah I feel bots like no point ah
because all the toxic uh opponents or teammates right
it's because your team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious ah especially the filipinos and the pinoys in DOTA wah
damn toxic man they like I don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also ah
oh genshin is just my browser not loading ah I think if maybe got to do with my internet connection at that point in time
but I yet to try again ah
the main part of the whole thing ah
mm
but like
ah
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
uh huh
okay
uh huh
ah
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
oh I see I see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
mm
ya right right right
the best so far
one of ah
ah better than runescape
ah
ya confirm laze ah after a while
ya ya
maybe lah perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot sia this game it's like available on all platform except like console lah
you can whale on genshin also
uh huh
huh wah this crazy ah
wah
so you think this one more
you know money intensive or maple
ah
do you even spent money on games
orh okay ya okay makes sense
orh
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
oh
ya ya ya
oh why eh
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
bayern very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth ah
hmm ya each to its own ah
ha when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
fuh
when's the last time when's the last time you went
ah
oh so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
can ah try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent ah and like
they really build up their name eh you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by uh Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there ah pretty nice lah you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same ah throughout all these brands I would say
ah
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
mm
ya
eh but this one is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do lah but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these uh
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding eh I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
uh let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than eh APOL is three nine eight
ya
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
uh that one obvious sia the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like um forceful kind of you know
what they call it ah damage on your behalf then it would be voided ah
I
over time maybe yes ah
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
uh huh
ya kinda it is it is
ya
that's true ah Coke like damn sweet eh I I'm not a fan of Coke ah it's too sweet for me
ah
ya standard correct
ah
oh carton
ah
ya ya syrup kind of base drink ah
that's non-fizzy
mm Seasons the blue colour one right
that's the green tea ice lemon tea eh is it
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
eh wait seasons
oh I think I got I think I never try Seasons uh peach tea before eh
oh no I don't think so eh the I can't recall
maybe ah
mm
uh
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
because you got the mindset lah like you know there's a
relax corner in school
ya
ya true true
uh
I also finding ah I want find like uh you know like stable kind of part-time
and nine dollars ah if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of um eatery
never banquet I never do before that time was uh kitchen job ah
ya Grand Hyatt ah
so you know when banquet uh how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already ah that's why
orh
Shangri-La
uh huh
gary gary kan you know gary then the alex those people
events
ah ya ya ya they are events uh lighting all this kind of stuff
oh
orh
uh huh
a'ah
oh
ya ya
so it's a win win
it's a win win situation lah
ya
true
because
eh since when you care sia bro
okay lah okay lah uh you changed man right
no the swedish bistro uh they call it
ya
uh huh
I'm not sure ah if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
mm
err but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called ah
Malayan Council eh
huh serious
I never tried that food before ah but the desserts not bad ah quite delicious
uh ya my sis told me also because the boss kan like it's uh this chinese guy
he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right ah
ah
ya that's why that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
uh the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and uh tea or something like that
good good the
actually I don't know also I never see the store in person before
ya around there ah arab street haji lane
damn long ah I never go this kind of place
eh next time
eh of course ah I broke man need to find work
go there then step give the akshay face ah
no beef lah then like just laze ah
hey beef is on bro
wah I need to watch the thing
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video
to their series then I'm like huh
can't be like just a random fellow can managed to get a skater
a proper renowned skater you know to come in
uh huh
ya exactly
uh
ya it can never get old ah
which one
uh I don't know I haven't been like keeping up to date ah with their videos
shit I never watch I never see that
you and him met first then I was still on the way there
ya
eh I injured man right
or how who else sundair but achap cannot what
I thought you say he's out for the month
talk on Discord eh don't say like that
have a day outing
that
hashtag
mm later he got hashtag dare to stab
eh
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish uh cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
huh
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like uh it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
ah ya something like that
but it's quite dope ah
ya
five I don't know ah I never see since the pre-order part
I think no ah like they still publish ah it's just that it's out of stock on the main uh website if I'm not mistaken
ah but you don't actually own you didn't own one right

okay ah was short-lived also ah
it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing err like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that ah Vita
ah Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
I think
mm I think the main appeal is just because can support the
uh what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new what this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame lah to me

no no sia
david kind
I don't know ah
he wah crazy
for what case you don't know ah

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh

hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm

I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right

mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer

ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh

it's very filling
ya
mm

ya
ya kan just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature what
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
uh but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
uh huh
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you eh school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go ah
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
mm okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm

I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya err but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
ya
mm

err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say

for me
drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual
right
so I'm okay with any

ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive

I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me

mmhmm
ya

I don't mind

I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
