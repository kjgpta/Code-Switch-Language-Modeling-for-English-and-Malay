alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things
ah macam ginger ke balms
err your mum masak or orh
ah dia orang nak pergi perang nak kena ada aircon juga sia kita singaporeans siol ah count on me singapore
ah then my mum like eh pergi buka tunjuk kat adrian fireworks then I tried to switch on my it wasn't there

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam

or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories
alahai dah banyak privilege
lagi people sayanglah aku ni yang kat depan ni sial
mm lepas tu aku gi normal sebab aku boleh sports dalam rumah
it's like you would have like I don't know macam kau ada kan
tak ada script and you have obvious obviously you have a script in front of you you know you would have practice it at home
tak ada ke macam someone like err no one plays sports in the house go normal and
ya tak ada ke like just a
ah of of people's voice actually marwah punya ex ex secretary also so like the moment I heard that I told azmi like alright
yes my vote is not a secret undi awak adalah rahsia
macam main bawah blok sia tu bro
eh anyway sekarang david moyes kat mana siol
oh dia sekarang manage west ham oh west ham eh ah how did west ham do in their oh they lost against new castle
and you know we we've got these we've got these dia macam kau macam you just look at this guy
and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh

esok aku ada appointment ah tiga
pagi aku kerja office eh kerja work from home

is it retrenchment tu lah dia
so what they did was remember back then when we were working in the day we used to order food ya for not dinner lah I would say supper kira if you're working until eleven you will get free food correct
so macam nampak lawa lah kira I mean in in the system you will look as a pre order lah
we saw fida dengan ruby
fida dengan ruby stare shida dengan aku sial
asal eh asal
dia she backstab me a lot of times lah
dia gila pangkat eh
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai
ya he very long I never see him sia it's been like ages man lama tak jumpa

so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
boleh beli kalau you nak boleh beli yang
entah apa brand lah but I can recommend you few brands
