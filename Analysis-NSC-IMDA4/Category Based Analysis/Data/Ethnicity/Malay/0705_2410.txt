actually what what I had planned for this year was
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> okay okay [lah] (err) maybe before that also [lah]
before that <malay>aku kerja dekat</malay> public utilities board [lah] (uh) it was ya you you know [ah]
[ah] bill <malay>air</malay> [lah] bill <malay>air</malay>
okay
so ya so that was my first job [lah] ever since <malay>aku</malay> I I've I've been working there (err) <malay>untuk enam tahun</malay> [ah] so (err) so (err)
I was in the I was doing (err) project management in their construction line [lah]
[ah]
yes
ya I I applied for (err) I I was quite lucky <malay>sebab</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> apply <malay>kerja tu</malay> and (uh)
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response [lah]
and the
[ah] ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times [lah] so
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kerja sana</malay> for <malay>enam tahun</malay>
then (err)
at at that time <malay>pun</malay>
(err) when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
then (err) I also I also same like like like you [lah] also thinking what should I do what's my career path because honestly speaking <malay>pun</malay> at that time <malay>bila aku</malay> apply <malay>itu kerja pun</malay>
<malay>aku aku
it was just a job for me
<malay>dia bukan</malay> [ah]
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]
and [ah] just to
to to to earn to earn money [lah]
I rather than <malay>kau dah</malay> <malay>abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa</malay> [kan] so (err) so might as well
I just took took up the job [lah] so (err) when I took up the job I <malay>aku</malay> got a lot of free time and <malay>aku pun</malay> look around <malay>aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya</malay> friends
most of them they further their studies
so <malay>aku pun fikir</malay> I think I should also do that <malay>tapi</malay> I also I also made a mistake
like <malay>aku</malay> like follow the <malay>aku</malay> follow the
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
like in a way follow the trend <malay>bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri</malay> [ah]
[ah]
so or everyone's anytime at <malay>aku</malay> was like saying to myself [oh] everyone's furthering their studies so I should also take up a further my studies [ah] I didn't I I didn't really (err)
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay [ah] just go go go ahead with it
a degree then I I asked myself like okay what degree should I take at that time <malay>aku aku pun tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>nak nak</malay>
<malay>nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>apa</malay> then <malay>aku cakap dengan diri aku</malay> okay since <malay>aku</malay> working in this line
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
I <malay>apa</malay> my boss
I have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is (err) <malay>kirakan</malay> (err) is one way for me to progress [lah]
down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
[ah] so as to be honest <malay>pun apa</malay> my diploma <malay>pun</malay> anytime time <malay>masuk</malay> poly <malay>pun</malay>
it was just like [ah]
I just take up this course [ah] it wasn't (err) (err) it wasn't it wasn't like [oh] <malay>aku</malay> passionate about this course (err) <malay>aku nak nak jadi</malay> engineer no [ah] in it was nothing like that [lah]
ya
so (err) at at that time [ah] after <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> ya you you should you feel lost [lah] <malay>macam apa kau nak buat dengan hidup aku</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah]
so [ah]
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
so <malay>apa ni</malay> at that time <malay>pun macam lepas</malay> <malay>pun abeh macam</malay>
even before during my poly I went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
<malay>pasal</malay>
(err) it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
(err) for my internship [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
internship <malay>aku yang</malay> really opened up my eyes <malay>yang</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] industry
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(err)
<malay>aku</malay> don't mind [lah] telling <malay>apa</malay> telling you the story <malay>tapi</malay> if if you don't mind listening if you if you are a person who is not bored to listening to stories <malay>aku</malay> don't mind just
just sharing my my my experiences [lah]
okay okay (mm)
so (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> for my internship
ya they attach me to a local construction company
(err) so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries [lah] or you can see a big difference between a local company and (err) (err) foreign or multinational company [lah]
I (err) in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that [lah] so I was attached to a local construction company [lah]
so the first day I reported to work (err) like <malay>aku masuk dia punya</malay> office the office is a
(uh) its a container office [lah] because it's a construction site <malay>apa</malay> but this [ah] this construction site okay [lah] [ah] wasn't like those like <malay>ulu ulu punya tempat</malay> [ah]
[ah] the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> upgrading project to a
a
a junior college [ah] so <malay>aku</malay> first day report to to the
the office <malay>aku masuk aje dia punya</malay> in the office
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
<malay>tak ada satu orang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada satu orang pun yang macam</malay>

<malay>tak ada satu orang pun yang macam</malay> acknowledge <malay>aku</malay> exist in
in their office ya that was that was how I felt [lah]
and the the first person who acknowledged me <malay>kau tahu siapa</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> office boy

[ah] and he he's employed ya <malay>dia kirakan macam</malay> those bangla worker <malay>tapi sedap dia ada</malay> education he has a degree in india but it wasn't recognised
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy

then you literally work your way up [ah]
but at that point
<malay>bila aku</malay> happy <malay>kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay>
didn't didn't thought had that in mind [lah]
and <malay>aku pun</malay> so it it gave me like
(err) doubts [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> like
did I make the right move <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean
<malay>apa</malay> it doesn't really matter also [lah]
ya so
just went along [lah] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>aku pun fikir balik</malay> like
(err) ya what he say really (err) <malay>apa</malay> like
(err)
[ah] like
[ah] <malay>tak bedek</malay> [ah] but
and it also [ah]
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks [ah] <malay>abeh aku pun fikir balik macam</malay> [sial] [ah] <malay>aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak</malay> resign [oh] just
because <malay>aku nak nak nak</malay> listen to that guy [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> you
you just made do with what you have [ah] you just make do with what you have <malay>memang betul</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> the the at that at that time my my nature of work
you need to have some technical knowledge [lah] which I was lacking [ah]
(err) with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking [ah]
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad [ah]
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas [lah]
so
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya ya
so ya (err)
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
it didn't turn out quite that bad also <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
[ah] consultants usually they provide the technical (err) aspect [ah]
so (err) when when when whenever you
<malay>macam</malay> you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants [ah] so
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
<malay>abeh</malay> (err) from
from <malay>aku punya</malay> nature of work <malay>pun</malay> project management <malay>pun</malay> what what I
what I
what was more on the soft skills
<malay>pasal</malay>
back then <malay>pun aku</malay> wasn't really a
a a <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm
I am a very quiet guy [lah] <malay>aku</malay> not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
but
[ah] when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it [lah]
[ah]
so so ya you <malay>aku aku</malay>
improve on my soft skills and then <malay>dekat</malay> (err) during my course of work <malay>pun</malay> there like what I told you [ah] who decided to further my studies take up
a a
a degree [lah] then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it [ah]
ya so
then you decided not to
okay [ah]
good for you [lah] good for you I mean
[ah] ya so
I took up
(err) my part-time degree
like I told you before [lah] <malay>apa aku</malay> time <malay>ambil</malay> degree <malay>pun</malay> was like
[oh] everyones
doing a degree I should also do a degree <malay>tapi</malay>
at that time ya like
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> was just following the trend [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> now now <malay>aku fikir balik</malay> I shouldn't have do that [lah] I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
really take up a degree in what really interest you [ah]
and (uh) what you really want to do [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> that time
(mm) (mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> (err)
since you say it like that <malay>pada aku</malay> in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in [ah] so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay (um) which I agree [lah] which a degree is not really [ah] <malay>apa</malay> a need [ah]
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay>
when <malay>aku</malay> did my degree (uh)
(err) <malay>aku</malay> did my degree while while working [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> as years go by [eh]
<malay>aku kat kerja aku</malay> like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya sama</malay> [ah] like
work environment <malay>pun</malay>

like [ah] so like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya</malay> bosses [eh] like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>dia orang ada takde pun macam beza</malay> [sia]
like they are just like <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(uh) we are a big
organisation [kan] like ya we have a <malay>apa</malay> like (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> stat board they call it [lah]
and then they got their directors [lah] and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy [ah]
when <malay>kau pun</malay> <malay>pun</malay> you should know [ah] [kan] hierarchy [ah] it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau kat bawah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak kena dengar kata dia ni abeh dia ni kadang-kadang tak</malay>

(err) <malay>lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena</malay>
<malay>go through dia kau nak kena go through orang atas dia</malay>
<malay>abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu</malay> decision <malay>orang atas dia lagi</malay>
I mean <malay>kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka</malay>
<malay>orang bawah abeh dia orang bertekak abeh kau kat bawah</malay>
like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like
<malay>kau orang</malay> (err) <malay>kau orang</malay> cannot make a decision <malay>abeh aku nak kena buat apa</malay> [siol]
like sometimes the conflict like
<malay>bertahun-tahun lepas punya</malay> [sia]
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang dari dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh sampai sekarang</malay>
more like <malay>pada aku</malay> it's not healthy [ah] <malay>abeh abeh macam aku</malay> like <malay>kat situ</malay> [eh] <malay>aku kerja situ</malay> like !siala! <malay>macam aku kalau</malay> stay <malay>sini aku tak nak</malay> [sia] end up <malay>macam kau orang</malay> ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true [ah] <malay>aku</malay>
dispute it [lah] <malay>apa</malay> (err) government really iron rice bowl [lah] as in like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally [ah] living a comfortable life [ah]
but <malay>aku</malay> just don't see myself doing that long term [ah]
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to

transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa</malay> time is like you you will feel the time pressure [lah]

to go ahead with it <malay>aku</malay> look up <malay>ada ada aku aku</malay> just look up on google [lah] of of [ah] media courses [ah] <malay>abeh aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>

we are are we
<malay>aku dah</malay> like that five years [eh] <malay>aku pun</malay> like like like <malay>macam</malay> in a way like <malay>macam</malay> drag myself to to finish it [ah]
<malay>abeh</malay> (err)
<malay>lepas tu aku sekarang nak</malay> go into media industry <malay>kalau aku nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>aku nak kena</malay>
pick up another three years of study
<malay>aku</malay> was like !siala! five years of study <malay>dah dah macam dah cukup</malay> [ah] like [ah] enough of studying [ah] [sia] [ah] enough of studying [ah] I mean
[ah] <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak</malay> take up another degree
another three years of degree for media <malay>abeh aku</malay> just look out <malay>aku tengok</malay> mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma [ah] it's just a one year course okay [lah] one year <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>masih boleh</malay> take it [lah] one year okay [lah] so I I I I grabbed it [ah]
then (err) <malay>aku pun</malay>
at that time was
was so was want to
transition into the media industry [kan] so <malay>aku</malay> like thought of (err) maybe (err) take a gap year first [ah] before <malay>aku</malay> joined the media industry
so (uh) <malay>apa aku</malay>
was planning to take my gap year which was this year <malay>aku</malay> (uh) already plan to go to new zealand
[ah] there's this
(err)
it's called a [ah]
a working holiday if you heard of it [ah] basically I basically it's it's a holiday <malay>tapi</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau boleh</malay> you can apply for a job there
but [ah] but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs [lah] it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs <malay>ataupun</malay> part-time jobs are those kind of jobs [ah] ya [ah] so
and then the new zealand (err) working holiday is is a visa [lah] basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
(err) the visa is for six months
so (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err)
(err)
<malay>kalau</malay> there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
<malay>pasal</malay> [ah] their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry <malay>kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam</malay> singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
