then you will rebound back ya so now I think you are damn traumatised too [oh] my god that was so bad but then like you didn't know
like light snacks
no but like you also have to think like in a in a healthy way
it means maybe he is worried about your health then like for you to get both why you want motor though like I planning to take car like next year why motor
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them <malay>nak kereta</malay> I mean like ya [oh] sorry I don't know [what] I mean I don't understand like
(mm) like your brother (mm) wait are you an only child !wow!
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking [ah] cause you know they always #jio# us at
they throw malays everywhere but the army
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry [ah] I quite shocked [ah] but #alhamdulillah# at least he got there I mean <malay>macam</malay> token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
of course [lah] but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things [lah] you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just <malay>risau</malay> then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior <malay>macam tukar macam</malay> sergeant <malay>kau</malay> then <malay>kalau nak buat benda</malay> like he can <malay>macam</malay> threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can <malay>macam</malay> move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you <malay>nampak</malay> the news <malay>baru keluar</malay> like [ah] this chinese man
<malay>dia</malay> freaking like molest <malay>budak kecil perempuan</malay> and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is <malay>macam kalau nak cakap pasal</malay> sexual cases like harassment <malay>kat</malay> singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course [ah] but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute [ah] you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we (err) the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect [orh]
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of <malay>para</malay> muslim say that like !alah! but then like <malay>maki</malay> !alah! also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism <malay>macam dia tak nak apa-apa</malay> religion at all <malay>kat dalam dia orang</malay> country or <malay>tak nak</malay> individualism <malay>kat dalam</malay> country <malay>dia orang</malay> also <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tudung semua tak nak</malay> which I don't understand because other people from other religion <malay>macam</malay> nuns <malay>tu semua</malay>
because they <malay>tutup</malay> also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards <malay>macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh</malay> and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya <malay>dia kata dia tak suka hijab</malay> cause we look scary
ya like I don't understand (err)
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot [lah] <malay>macam aku boleh</malay> (err) <malay>macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun</malay> the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant <malay>dia orang tak kesah</malay> but the thing is even if you <malay>tak kesah</malay> or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need [oh] really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
ya I think cause of our <malay>agama</malay> also cause you know #nabi muhammad# he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot <malay>agama</malay> and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world <malay>kita dalam</malay> bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so <malay>selesa</malay> and comfortable <malay>dalam</malay> singapore then when you like <malay>tak kesah</malay>
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and <malay>apa lagi</malay> like just <malay>perangai dia orang</malay> [ah] I'm wanna believe is adolescence but <malay>macam bodoh apa</malay> like <malay>kalau kau tengok balik</malay> they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of <malay>mak minah</malay> scares me ya scare me like <malay>dulu dulu</malay> is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I see them like throwing <malay>maki</malay> [ah] <malay>mak kau</malay>
<malay>mak kau</malay> ya is just uncomfortable [lah] to <malay>tengok</malay> like the younger generation
is very <malay>sedih</malay> ya <malay>macam kalau</malay> cause the thing is (um) like the older generation <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> the younger generation <malay>aku macam</malay> (err) like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
<malay>apa dia buat ni</malay> [ah]
honestly I don't even think you are a <malay>minah</malay> you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they <malay>fikir</malay> just because then they feel <malay>macam</malay>
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something [ah] is not even <malay>tegur</malay> is like <malay>sindir</malay> like <malay>asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) sorry sally like like you know like <malay>asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) I'm trying my best you know like the way they <malay>tegur</malay> is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya (mm)
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to <malay>jaga hati</malay> or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you <malay>ungkitkan balik</malay> I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context <malay>macam apa ni bodoh</malay> like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit [ah] a bit sometimes they a bit too proud [ah] of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up <malay>macam dulu aku kecil-kecil</malay> how [ah] I don't know [lah]
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
!wow! congratulations !wow! <malay>masuk jannah esok</malay> but I've met some people that <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) like <malay>hafal al quran</malay> all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I <malay>tersinggung sikit sebab</malay> I <malay>tak boleh hafal</malay> but like you know there's no need to
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I come after you [eh] <malay>aku baru habis khatam</malay> [tau] <malay>kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam</malay> like !wow! and usually is like not saying what [ah] but is the <malay>madrasah</malay> kids <malay>pun macam gitu</malay> ya and then they
[eh] I don't know <malay>cakap bahasa arab aku macam</malay> okay thanks [oh] my god ya [oh] my god ya is it like sometimes <malay>aku</malay> like just <malay>fikir</malay> and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by <malay>cemburu</malay> or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like <malay>macam</malay> it just like <malay>sakit hati</malay> the way they talk to us is like that
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you <malay>khatam</malay> like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to <malay>macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang</malay> not even about <malay>quran</malay> or what like just in life general <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia lari empat</malay> round you you <malay>baru lari dua</malay> round then you just say [oh] I finished eight rounds <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also <malay>apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang</malay> vlogging vlogging <malay>tu</malay> [kan] okay
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor !wow!
I only have one girl friend that <malay>ada lesen motor</malay> and she <malay>bawa</malay> scooter ya <malay>comel bodoh</malay> and is very is the [lah] like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that [ah]
okay sorry I didn't know it's <malay>comel</malay> at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like <malay>hujan</malay> a bit difficult though ya (mm) ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the <malay>besar</malay> one just like five K starting price

I can <malay>bawa</malay> already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who <malay>takde lesen</malay> then they just <malay>bawa</malay> motor they just <malay>bawa</malay> as long as you <malay>tak kena tangkap</malay>
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends [lah] like you know they just <malay>bawa takde lesen</malay> as long as you <malay>tak tangkap</malay> is okay <malay>takut</malay> risky

they said hot <malay>sakit berat berat</malay> is it what you say heavier [ah]
I have no idea but [oh]
but you know one brand like <malay>gudang garam</malay> that [one] like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like <malay>bawa ke sekolah</malay> and then they spread [ah] ya like I don't know how they supply <malay>dapat</malay> like that day <malay>budak ni bawa tu macam</malay>
you know when they <malay>jual</malay> it then that thing you know then <malay>dia kasi kasi orang</malay> I don't know if they <malay>beli</malay> or what [ah] but I'm just like very curious <malay>macam mana korang dapat ni semua</malay> especially when they are underage and then <malay>beli</malay>
wait you have an island there !wow! that's so cool
which part is that which
which part is that [oh] like you are in the islands [oh] so my family is like my mother side from #jakarta# so ya is the capital (um) ya it's alright yeah it's alright
(mm) I've never been there also
I mean [eh] that's a huge flex [eh] you want to like <malay>minum bandung</malay> I want to drink <malay>bandung</malay> in #bandung# like !wow! I mean if
you had the money like <malay>takde</malay> feeling there [ah] <malay>makan</malay> french fries <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] don't attack me like that ya K but not saying our humour I think we've been bred like that do you see now like the media singapore media so lame
!wow! [oh] ya
but interesting [what] they get to think what we are thinking also I bet they are like listening or just like what the heck is going on wait do we have to transcribe this [oh] do we I don't want [sia]
you want like just keep quiet right and then <malay>tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang</malay> why is it quiet [ah]
<malay>kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba</malay> like [ah] <malay>budak ni tak nak kasi duit</malay> (mm) (mm) #inshallah#
<malay>kasi</malay> surprised <malay>kasi</malay> us another surprise
I think so ya
<malay>tapi</malay> feel like <malay>banyak</malay> though on the other side <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>budak-budak ni</malay>
I mean who doesn't <malay>duit tu siapa tak nak</malay> though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche <malay>semua nak buat</malay> like <malay>orang cina-cina</malay> you know like the youtubers <malay>siapa ni</malay> I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel [lah] in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast <malay>melayu</malay> like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start [ah] then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know (err) malay podcast usually talk about <malay>agama</malay> like a lot of it
no
sometimes malaysian humour confuses me (mm) (mm) on spotify have [ah]
cool (uh) I mean that's good also they are trying to
I <malay>pusing</malay> so no [lah] [eh] I only ever seen like those ya but that [one] is like <malay>tiga puluh sen</malay> like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that [one] you pass around your friends
lighter <malay>kau ada</malay> lighter <malay>tak</malay> lighter <malay>aku dah habis</malay> ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
or you can start like refillable refillable lighter start a business !wow! look at us planning business ya I mean go for it
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just <malay>tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi</malay> I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but <malay>aku tak dengar banyak macam</malay> success story for <malay>melayu</malay> that's like !wow! you know
(mm) I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya <malay>untuk anjing</malay> [ah] I mean that's for them [ah] that's a niche for them but like <malay>aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya</malay> community <malay>diam</malay> [jer]
[kan] [kan] <malay>aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan</malay> though
no I think like when we send it to them then <malay>dia orang akan dengar</malay> and I think cause cause the video they show <malay>dalam</malay> form like changing changing the code switching that [one] I think they <malay>akan belajar</malay> to like analyse the way we <malay>cakap</malay>
interesting [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit [lah] how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like <malay>campur</malay> is usually one one like ya around me [lah] is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the <malay>bahasa ibunda</malay> I'm like bro
I think as long as you can hold a conversation is okay
ya <malay>betul betul</malay>
how how no like cause like I've been to K everybody been to stations but like like most of them they are like chinese
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that <malay>aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa</malay> I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore <malay>hijab</malay>
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered #bak kwa# before I'm like <malay>我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren</malay> no #bak kwa# for me no oink oink for me sweetie
like then they get so aggressive I'm not I'm not hating or anything but they are so ya and like ya and like you know on also during sitting down they will like stare you down I've never seen a malay aunty stare you down for a seat
but like the (err) chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if <malay>kalau tu bukan apa ni</malay> reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
(um) I won't go as far as full responsibility maybe just a bit ya
