<malay>akak kakak</malay> last <malay>kerja kat mana</malay>
<malay>kakak kerja apa kat situ</malay>
<malay>penat tak kerja situ</malay>
okay <malay>kak</malay> okay <malay>kalau kalau kerja kat situ</malay> [kan] <malay>apa yang akak pelajari</malay>
<malay>ada ada apa kak kerja kak ada pekerja yang susahkan benda tak</malay>
<malay>sambil kakak kerja kat kilang itu kakak ada pernah buat kesilapan apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>daripada</malay> incident <malay>tu</malay>
okay <malay>kakak sekarang mempunyai</malay> (um) experience experience <malay>di dalam bahagian industri</malay> baking (um) <malay>kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba</malay> industry <malay>yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba</malay>
<malay>apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar</malay> (uh) <malay>kanak-kanak yang kecil</malay>
<malay>kira kakak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak</malay> have the skills <malay>untuk</malay> cope with this problem
<malay>dengan adanya</malay> technologies <malay>sebagai telefon bimbit dan</malay> tablet <malay>adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita</malay> around ten years old <malay>ke</malay> eight years old <malay>gitu bila tak ada komputer semua</malay> or <malay>bila takde</malay> handphone <malay>kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita</malay> time <malay>kecil</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak dulu beza</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab dulu kita takde</malay> netflix <malay>takde</malay> youtube <malay>kita cuma tengok</malay> live and live <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> if you want to go to the toilet <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> advertisement
then remember last time you have to <malay>apa nak kena</malay> rush the toilet <malay>kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat</malay>
<malay>sekarang senang</malay> [jer] now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it [kan] like how did we survive last time like <malay>kalau</malay> you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit <malay>susah tapi</malay> like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
like there's only one computer in the house then <malay>kalau</malay> if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so <malay>kakak</malay> remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way <malay>macam</malay>
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at <malay>rumah lama</malay> that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya [oh] what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should (uh) and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor
okay bye
