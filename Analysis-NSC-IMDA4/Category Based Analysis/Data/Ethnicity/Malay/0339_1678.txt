<malay>kalau</malay>
east
it would be a very long journey home whether I take train or I take bus [lah]
ya <malay>kalau</malay> north like #yishun# (uh) that side all like <malay>macam</malay> quite accessible [ah]
almost almost the same [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I feel like red line red the the red line area is ya

ya especially like (uh) the the #khatib# and that one #yio chu kang# that one like for real I feel like tomorrow then I reach
ya but okay [lah]
(mm) I mean central is the best [lah]
I say like for a dream house right the house to be like
(mm) ya [lah]
but central limited [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> nothing much
I see like <malay>macam</malay> the houses okay [lah] okay
central is <malay>apa</malay> central is like
[oh] okay [lah] okay okay ya
(mmhmm)
ya #mattar# is inconvenient those that have (uh) blue line is quite (uh)
no [lah] no (um) because my my area don't have any line what I mean like the nearest is purple line and red line
ya
so all the blue blue line is like so far apart
like for me
[ah] in a way <malay>macam</malay> fill in the dots fill in [ah] connect the dots ya
ya
but we still no dot
we still like out of the region
(mmhmm)
right
[ah] it's always the issue
executive mansion executive is dubbed mansion [ah] is it maisonette
it's this big
it's that category [ah]
so executive
<malay>apa</malay> each each
okay
what
ya
(mm)
okay now now that kind of house is I mean like (um) now the normal house [eh] resale house already like half a million already you know
like like my area my area is already five hundred plus plus K already
ya ya my my house is (uh) reach half a million already like above
ya like above above ya
[ah] I don't know [lah] because my my parents that's like their (uh) <malay>harta</malay> [eh] is it <malay>harta</malay> ya so so they want to like keep
I mean like they of course they have thoughts of like moving [lah] but then
not at the moment
ya
four
cause it's very long already [sia] it's like
thirty over years
and
I think because it's not say accessible but then like it's like we live at central central
so <malay>macam</malay> in a way
(um) even okay let's not (uh) like <malay>macam</malay> if you take (err) car or like <malay>macam</malay> grab <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] if you take want to like #tampines# or want to go
(um) maybe
I say like woodlands or what right it will take less than half an hour
<malay>macam</malay> the journey is if I could like quite okay [lah] if you take like (um) car or like you know grab or taxi
ya but if like you go by bus or what usually
ya more than half an hour like forty minutes
ya then like my area there I think because like
I don't know
no not a lot of things I think because it's balestier so balestier like
I don't know [ah]
like the outside part [lah]
not my my inside part got a lot of like elderly
ya especially elderly ya
but that but that house like !wow!
[eh] what what
why were we talking about it just now
[oh] okay ya
so (mm) so I think if like other area
(um)
of course like if if there is I mean like executive I don't think it will be below
ya
ya
like I like go for it already [seh]
ya then I'll be like very lucky
ya so I would go with like six or seven
<malay>tak akan dapat</malay> [eh]
one million [ah]
dude that one I might as well I take landed right
actually landed and
if if okay if I were to take landed and
executive right I mean it's it's not really far apart [what] right
then if I were to like work even a bit more harder or wait longer then maybe I can get a good landed
[eh]
I mean that if like is what I want [lah]
ya
ya I think our area this the central central is like already
ya
[ah]
(mm)
okay
that's why ya
because like I mean like especially like in our generation right we will take even longer to like pay compared to our parents' time
ya I think our parents' time
ya
(mmhmm) ya ya ya standard
high already
well tomorrow I buy
ya [oh] my god
(mm)
golf club
[oh]
I think you can
(mmhmm)
(uh) then
wait million wait wait wait million and <malay>juta</malay> same
so how you want billion or you want <malay>juta</malay>
billion [ah] [oh] that's !wah!
!wah!
means you would be the richest there already
I mean if you were to
ya
a pool of
ya [oh] my god

not even like <malay>macam</malay> west countries you know
like or like not man not maybe [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> those (um) west west country [lah]

family members support also you know <malay>macam</malay> like they like [oh] okay [lah] I got this amount like I
is is for you actually you know it's though it's a gift or something like that then from there they like make it even bigger
ya you know like I want ya it's a I think like
(um)
some of like (err) my friends
like they they they mentioned
(um) what is that
like their family has a asset
actually I think for them or something like that so so they actually (um)
their their parents only get to
(err) release that thing

[oh] sorry like a lot of things going on in my mind
a lot a lot of things going inside the room
okay
okay so okay I let me restart
<malay>boleh tak</malay> start <malay>balik</malay>
okay I have a friend in in [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they are they are brought up in a very (err)
good family
ya so like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like (uh) for them so at a certain age then (uh) it will be (uh) released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at (uh) one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them [lah] what what they want to use it as
so
(uh)
so
<malay>apa ni</malay>
ya [lah] they
(um)
they they have plans they already planned what they want to do with that money
[oh] that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know [lah] they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know

and after then (mm) ya [lah] I think there's a lot of like then and then and (uh) so and so
ya
ya so so he already plan out [lah] like what he want to do with the money it's either he
(uh) buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
so like <malay>macam</malay> most of them (um)

(err) overseas [lah] so like
so like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age [ah] then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
[oh] they can
they are mature enough to handle the money [lah]
so I like !wah! so so lucky then like they like very #chim# know then like <malay>macam</malay>
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like or like you know they they like [oh] nevermind [lah] just we (uh) see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like [oh] okay [lah] see [lah] I think I think my father (um)

them I'm like !wah! so pampered [one] ya
so ya I think this (uh) I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what [lah]
ya
see their background [lah]
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
exactly
(mm)
just nice
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
degree degree
<malay>susah sangat</malay> [eh]
actually right
okay continue nevermind
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach (um) the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to <malay>macam</malay>
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay [lah] but then I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
(um)
the type of work or like <malay>macam</malay> what you want to do
ya because like I feel like because (uh) I have this (uh) conversation [lah] with my (um)
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not (um) under (err) not really under
so it's like more of like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] private or something like that but he go to schools [lah] to conduct
the classes so like
he was like (uh) telling me #afiq# actually [kan] (um) degree <malay>tak tak perlu sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like if you want you want [lah] I mean like
!huh! my my senior [ah] my senior <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually at first also I want to take degree then <malay>bila fikir balik macam</malay>
(um) waste (uh) not not not say waste of time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like (um) he just keep on doing like (uh) freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
<malay>apa tu</malay> enhance or like
increase his (err) rapport or something like that
you get (um) what is that
[ah]
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get <malay>macam</malay> like his
recommendations also [lah] and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
[ah] then you take degree [lah] I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
[ah]
I mean it's good [lah] I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
(uh) like a bonus point [ah] [oh] okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like (hmm) but then of course (um) I want to do degree [lah] but
see [lah] how it goes
[oh] my god
(uh) as at that time I check
it was for one year [eh] for one year degree is around two five
two five
two five thousand
[ah] if for that one year
for that one year
ya because (um) half of the year
it's (um) overseas
ya so first half is (um) local then <malay>macam</malay> I think around four months [lah] four months is overseas
so I got a double cert <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) labrador labrador
labrador park
I don't know (uh) (uh) I know what's the it's at (uh) australia [eh]
like (uh) <malay>apa apa apa</malay> <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed [lah] like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya [lah] of course [lah] but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like <malay>macam</malay> a few years or like <malay>macam</malay> in one year [ah]
then like !wah! but really like hustling [ah] then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
project works ya project works then like their on come [eh] accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid [lah] it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like !wah!
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary [lah]
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
<malay>tunda</malay> [lah] <malay>kahwin</malay> [ho] then <malay>dapat anak dah empat puluh</malay>

ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya slack off
ya
(mm)
because of how you take the things [lah] [ah] how you like actually
(uh) handle the situation
ya like more more like career minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
or females is more like <malay>macam</malay> I feel that (uh) like girls [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like now the this like our generation [kan]
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path [lah]
but I feel that now like <malay>macam</malay> they want to
where be like the economy and such right so
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm) (mmhmm) (mm) ya
ya
unless ya unless your pay is like <malay>macam ada</malay> commission that kind
<malay>macam</malay> not
true [lah]
(mm)
I'll be like
[ah] that's the thing
so that's why you need to have a back up [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
as in like [ah] saving plan
but it's also like hard [lah] I mean like how if that if you get like one
<malay>satu ribu tu</malay> like for the longest time
[ah] then your the one that you saved up confirm <malay>[dah] makin</malay> lesser [what]
ya
ya
like a heads up [eh] <malay>macam</malay> now people start to think [oh] I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then how [seh] like that
(mm) ya (mm)
unless your company have like <malay>macam</malay> monthly pay cause (uh) ya cause like
some like (uh) my friend
(err)
(um) one of my friend (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
(err) <malay>dia kerja</malay> events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
and be [eh]
two point five ya two point five then after that
(uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> she
[ah] got commission so let's say if like she
(uh) managed to like (err) sell something or this (um) particular plan or what [eh] to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then !wah! she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then (um) they give her more
(um) jobs [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>ada</malay> commissions so <malay>macam</malay> they give a lot of like commission things [tau] so she need to do a lot of like
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like (uh) workers also will cut down [what]
so <malay>macam</malay> she will take in the other
(uh) person <malay>punya</malay> slot
so like okay let's say like <malay>macam</malay> you you already have a thing to do
then after that the one that is being (uh) cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay [lah] her pay got (uh) drop [lah] dropped by a few percent only like not much
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission <malay>tu</malay> will like
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
[ah]
I mean like if she get to sell (um) that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
(mmhmm)
so she have her own [one] and (uh) the friend commission
[oh] you mean (uh) the commission extra
yes
ya ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
like that [ah]
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
ya so so like <malay>macam</malay> it will add up [lah] it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
<malay>macam</malay> whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
get what I mean
[ah]
<malay>gila</malay> [kan]
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
ya [lah] she <malay>untung</malay> [lah]
(err) because like the (err) company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two (um)
two no not <malay>cawangan</malay> (err)
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
(uh) that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so that this group will do some of this group <malay>punya</malay> work then this group will do like ya
so it's like
crazy [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> like
because their their workload is doubled [ah] so of course their pay also in a way
doubled [ah]
amazing [eh]
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like <malay>banyak masalah</malay> [lah] ya
like you like your leave you cannot just
[ah] <malay>sembarang ambil</malay>
then it like you really need to
(uh) got [lah] got but then (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you need to work
you really need to <malay>macam</malay> you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend <malay>macam</malay>
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like <malay>macam</malay> just (um) quit
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need (um) income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say [lah] she say to the boss that
[oh] (um) you know (um) my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
(uh) a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my (uh) family ya
so like <malay>macam</malay>
they having this (uh) conversation and like this (um) argument and it's like about this thing [ah] then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that [ah] exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate [lah]
so like okay [lah]
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still (uh) working there
but she said that she won't be (err) staying [lah] I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say (um) stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard [ah]
ya
ya but you really need to stand for your right [lah] even though <malay>macam</malay> that pay is good <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] but you must know your
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
so that the their <malay>apa ni</malay> the one that will take over them
will not have a
[ah] <malay>dia orang punya anak</malay> will not have
to go through like this (uh)
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know [lah] in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya [lah] just that
I feel that now (uh) people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead
their death box ya
so that <malay>macam</malay> like in like some people have like emergency money [what]
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
[ah]
because because I know (err) I think (err) my my relative [eh]
[oh] at that time (uh) they have a saving so they were sharing with me [lah] and my family <malay>macam</malay> they have a saving
so (uh) this saving [eh] that they have [eh] is for like emergency for like maybe
(uh) okay their emergency is like so weird it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay emergency like wedding
like <malay>dia punya anak</malay> wedding
okay
urgent emergency
exactly <malay>macam</malay> okay like let's say <malay>macam</malay>
(err) last minute (um) the the <malay>anak</malay> couldn't pay for certain things [kan]
(err) then <malay>macam</malay> they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency [lah]
ya
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> like those those small things <malay>macam</malay> like maybe (uh) venue
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
[eh] don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
not it <malay>bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa</malay> but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her <malay>ikat tunang</malay>
[ah] [ah] that one I don't know [ah] okay <malay>dia punya ikat tunang</malay> is two years
so I think she like <malay>macam</malay> want to get (uh) married [lah] already [lah] <malay>macam</malay> more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say (err) nevermind [lah] <malay>buat</malay> simple simple
but that simple simple also need money [what]
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
so like everything was like <malay>tergantung</malay> then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said [oh] ya ya [ah] later [lah] later [lah] then
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
but her side is already then she like <malay>macam</malay>
take it very lightly so I was like thinking <malay>kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious <malay>ke tak</malay> serious <malay>ni</malay>
then I mean like if you want simple then just like <malay>nikah</malay> then <malay>makan sikit-sikit</malay> [ah] this one she do like a <malay>sanding sanding</malay>
then like got this and that I mean like <malay>macam</malay> okay the the quality is not as like
amazing but still like it's like [lah] I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
you know this girl [ah] she everything she <malay>tangguh tangguh tangguh</malay> then after that
[ah] then after that into the point where (uh) where the mum have to step in the mum like
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the <malay>mak</malay> ask her
then she like (err) ya actually <malay>ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini</malay> then the mum like
<malay>abeh macam mana</malay>
then the mum the <malay>mak</malay> don't want to say like she got money to help
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know [lah] so of course the mum need to like (mm) twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya [ah] then the mum was like saying !hais! [ah] then this one also I have to like (hmm)
then her mum actually (um) help out [lah] in a way like <malay>macam</malay> a few percent of the
whole thing [lah]
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya only like maybe like <malay>nikah</malay> [lah]
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to (err) burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out [ah]
[ah] that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift [lah] a gift
ya
(mm) then okay [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I think it's
I think it's a that's what like every parents want <malay>nak</malay> [ah] ya because like even my mum also like
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
(uh) don't want [lah] we make (uh) some some somewhere that is like <malay>macam</malay> bigger <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
because like you know (uh) so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
then like if more bigger means more money then she said (err) <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] (err) I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like <malay>macam</malay> burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> dilemma [lah] whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend (um) ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita buat</malay> simple simple you know <malay>gini gini</malay> but then like my mum want it to be like
(um) <malay>sempurna</malay> [lah] in a way looks good like people side
(uh) I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in (um)
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here [lah]
and she have a family in singapore [lah] because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> but the family is quite small
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one [ah] like the family in singapore [lah]
so okay so like <malay>macam</malay> not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less (err) he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
<malay>macam</malay> maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya <malay>dah</malay> how many
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like [oh] this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
know like <malay>macam</malay>
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate [lah] then my mum
try to understand also
but okay [lah] I mean like
different people different [lah] [ah]
ya like they they they know that okay (uh) this wedding
(uh) I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute (err) this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
ya ya see <malay>kalau ada kemampuan</malay> [lah] I mean like [ah] ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like <malay>macam</malay> maybe house or what
like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what [kan]
(uh) so that's why like <malay>macam</malay>
like my this (err) aunty set like (err)
this big amount [lah]
ya but
(mm)
ya that's the thing
and plus like <malay>macam</malay> it depend how you
like some people join what this (err) what is that called
investment [eh] <malay>apa tu namanya</malay> (um)
like <malay>macam</malay> like you will get money if you
like insurance like that <malay>tapi</malay> you will get monthly money [ah]
so after less interview of time
no <malay>macam</malay> every month you pay something then after that you will receive (um)
ya (uh) I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
[ah] at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
ya <malay>tak</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but (err) the but (uh) it's hundred fifty times twenty five
times the months [lah]
[orh]
(mm)
I think they have different different like
(mmhmm)
ya
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like <malay>macam</malay> a clean way of saving money or like getting investment [kan]
but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like
ya like like not not say illegal [lah] I mean like like legal
but it's riskier
(uh) I don't know
ya
<malay>masing-masing</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>masing-masing</malay>
ya I mean if you think that it's okay okay [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay> okay [ah]
ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
but this cannot be shared with you
(um) children [ah] if you if you have children
like this saving things you should not (err) I mean like
maybe
ya
until like they reach a certain age or what ya because it's scary because like they can you never know what will you know what they would what you expect them to do like
ya
