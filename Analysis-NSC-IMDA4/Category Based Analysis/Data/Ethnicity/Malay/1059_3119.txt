[ah] <malay>habis apasal</malay> taxi driver
okay
<malay>tapi dayah</malay> but [oh] my lord <malay>macam</malay> like
#dayah# is at the stage of her life that she's driven and <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of aspiration
<malay>habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia</malay> educated <malay>ke atau dia kaya ke</malay> at the end he's just going to be having this (err) aura of like <malay>macam</malay> relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
<malay>nanti tahu tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>berbual pasal ini</malay> okay <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>dia yang nanti belakang hari</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband <malay>lagi</malay> worse <malay>kalau dia</malay> have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character <malay>ke apa</malay> if he has it okay that <malay>macam</malay> he might ask #dayah# to stop working and things like that [lah]
<malay>habis</malay> so you just say that [ah]
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand <malay>pasal</malay>
this whole like family who <malay>yang macam</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu benda orang orang</malay> I don't know family <malay>ke sesiapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang rasa</malay>
[oh] <malay>lebih baik</malay> (err) <malay>halalkan percepatkan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> as if <malay>macam itu ikut sunah nabi</malay> okay they take that part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage but the other part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like <malay>macam</malay> your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody <malay>yang macam</malay> that <malay>macam</malay> is complementary to like your personality
<malay>mana boleh macam</malay> like that [ah] ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack (err) <malay>macam</malay> complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see <malay>macam</malay> that is the thing that <malay>orang</malay> just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part <malay>nak kahwin cepat macam</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>ikut sunah nabi percepatkan</malay> but part part <malay>lain macam</malay>
to get somebody that is competent with you <malay>ini semua tak tak ambil kira</malay> [ah]
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
<malay>habis zina cakap zina macam mana</malay>
(uh) anyway this boy the call you <malay>abang</malay> or what
he should be comfortable with it [lah] <malay>dia ada kakak apa</malay>
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh] so that's when he call you <malay>abang</malay> [ah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
so the conversation <malay>dengan zina</malay> (err) <malay>bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar</malay> it's more of like what what did you say to <malay>zina pasal yang</malay> the growing up and then <malay>pasal pasal</malay> making a <malay>apa</malay> plan <malay>habis pasal apa lagi</malay> like what else did you address
did you say that did you say
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this [ah] <malay>kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena</malay> wake up music just just just use this card
<malay>kata nak kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu</malay> <malay>tengok sampai perempuan agaknya</malay> she will just be fed up one day <malay>tapi betul apa macam</malay>
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect <malay>macam</malay> do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
easy go easy (uh) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> (uh) [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>itu tak ada pendirian</malay> [lah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
no <malay>macam gini</malay> the thing <malay>yang dia nak kena</malay> differentiate is <malay>ada bezanya</malay> easy-going <malay>dan tak ada haluan</malay> this is the thing #zina# you are which one
easy-going <malay>atau</malay> actually you are directionless
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
you said that [ah] <malay>untuk si ashraf ini</malay> [ah] <malay>habis ashraf cakap apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>budak ini pun tahu ke tak</malay> the background of #zina#
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
so this easily two years <malay>baru</malay> meet up <malay>tahu</malay>
!haiya!
I mean I !haiya! I don't know what to feel about this
I mean yes <malay>macam</malay> I am thankful and it's nice to know <malay>budak ini budak baik</malay> (err) so like what #izat# say <malay>kau tengok</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia</malay>
ya [lah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want after this #izat# say !huh! <malay>kau tengok macam aku cakap</malay>
<malay>dia budak baik</malay> I hope #izat# doesn't go like this [lah] ya but anyway
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
ya
send ya
must take this action
<malay>sambil lewa</malay> anyway what I was saying okay
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether (uh) I
I really don't know [lah] this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes <malay>macam</malay> to
push <malay>zina tapi</malay> I don't know if at the end of this product is #zina# will be
pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all #zina# loses <malay>dia punya</malay> identity because this she is she is <malay>macam</malay> dissolving into a very
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
[ah] it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible <malay>lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia</malay> see that I don't know [lah] sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if <malay>macam</malay> she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that <malay>macam</malay> you know like [ah] a woman shall be like <malay>macam</malay> be led by a man that kind of thing and
your life will turn out well
[ah]
at because at some point there will be a point that <malay>macam</malay> she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
no it's not say <malay>tak lepas tangan</malay> it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself [tau] this twentieth (uh) twenty some age
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to #dayah#
<malay>tak pernah tanya dia zina tak pernah tanya</malay>
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
but #dayah# said <malay>yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang</malay> denmark <malay>itu</malay>
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff <malay>orang punya</malay> personal is to us superficial
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
then you <malay>tak cakap macam dengan zina</malay>
at the end of the day #zina# #dayah# is still your sister <malay>macam</malay> you know she still cares for you [lah] then you know like
maybe she you <malay>tak cakap</malay> [lah] why why didn't you say to <malay>zina tadi</malay> like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you <malay>tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu</malay>
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya [lah]
ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya
then <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini</malay> mama and <malay>abah</malay> was there <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> you cannot chat <malay>ini</malay>
!huh!
my why is my recoding still (err) okay you continue <malay>kejap kejap</malay> ya my recording is kind of
[ah] [ah] [ah] where
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay> nevermind <malay>lepas itu</malay> then she say what <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa</malay>
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to #izat# ever since <malay>macam</malay> she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
you said that okay
okay
<malay>habis dia cakap habis dia cakap apa</malay>
and just because #izat# is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue [lah] <malay>cuba kalau</malay> the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies <malay>kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat</malay> will be supportive <malay>pasal apa</malay>
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that <malay>macam</malay> don't say that
you are <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] it's not that she will see all this point
<malay>habis</malay> if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
you said that [ah] then
<malay>habis cakap</malay> you're close to <malay>izat pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>suruh izat tolong</malay> [ah]
<malay>budak ni segan silu</malay> !wow!
ya
but that's because <malay>dia orang</malay> don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to <malay>tolong</malay> them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it [lah]
but it's hard [lah] I mean it's also vary in age age difference <malay>macam</malay> I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
it's very hard and you will often require a certain (mm)
change of life events or certain
[oh] you also cannot engineer it [what] #salim# like <malay>macam</malay> you cannot be bringing the two of them together
<malay>habis</malay> expect <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) to <malay>boleh berbual</malay> like at a very deep level <malay>mana boleh</malay> like it will also feel it's so <malay>janggal macam</malay> it was so it was just feel so weird [lah]
