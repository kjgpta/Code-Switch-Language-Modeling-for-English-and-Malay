why
ya cause K
I don't want to take private okay <malay>aku tak nak</malay> stereotype [ah] but you look at the people who take private O level
[ha]
I I got that mindset [lah] last time

then might as well I just fully focus as a full-time student just retake
<malay>tebalkan muka</malay> [ah]
and apparently I I was the only one <malay>yang</malay> retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back <malay>malu</malay> I guess so ya [lah] <malay>tapi ustazah siapa</malay> #masniah# <malay>tak salah</malay>
