<malay>dari mana entah semut ni datang</malay>
must be the crumbs [lah] don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I think <malay>banyak</malay> government bodies are using raffle's medical for checkup
I I expect you to go to the one at #bugis# the bigger one
[ah] that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
(oo) that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
[eh]
you have to wait equipment first [ah]
(oo) I thought they pay for you
who
!huh! you know you have a friend but you don't know who
(oo)
K never mind like I <malay>dekat</malay> I I can't recall
(oo)
you saw him or he told you are
(oo)
what you mean they have different different team [eh]
(err)
okay [lah] think can you can make it [lah]
ya [lah]
[lah] whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first [lah] while waiting for something that you used to do
[lah]
later the zoom
you do alone [eh] I I don't need to join you okay
it's so <malay>leceh</malay>
<malay>malas</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat</malay> zoom zoom <malay>ni</malay> I'm not comfortable [lah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> I keep looking at the teacher while I <malay>dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat</malay> teacher #nadia#
just like sad that her malay teacher <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>cikgu melayu dia cikgu</malay> #hafizah# <malay>dah tak ada</malay> [ah]
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
(err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is there [lah] definitely she's
the first to teach (err) #tasha#
but I believe <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
get the malay students to love
malay
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# make it more interesting
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
when #nadia# is in P three (err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# she's lucky because she knows <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# even before she started
[ah] teaching her so <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
so that's why I think it's a great loss (err) and she's there I think according to #tasha# it's like what she's only there for three years
so #tasha# was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one [lah]
(uh)
#tasha# is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
#tasha# is the first batch she teach three years [lah]
three years [eh] five years
ya initially #tasha# doesn't like her [what]
but in the end
[a'ah] see
her class [what]
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is #nadia# she pick and choose
when when the teacher she <malay>tak suka</malay>
it will affect her this what I notice [ah]
see like the I mean not <malay>apa</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya</malay> prefect <malay>punya tu</malay>
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around [lah]
because I think
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance [eh] her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her <malay>kakak</malay>
#tasha# #tasha# also [what]
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
at least she got two to her <malay>ni</malay> to her name
which now you don't expect her to dance [lah] she's got no interest already
#nadia# my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that (oo) tag rugby
(oo) touch rugby tag rugby
ya <malay>dia suka panjat-panjat</malay> [pe] <malay>banyak</malay> [pe] they go hiking and everything but then <malay>sekarang</malay>
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego [ah] the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active [lah] she is like she is active since young so
she's the one <malay>yang</malay> climbing all over the place
she's daring [lah] she she has the confidence
can [lah] let her try [lah]
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store [lah] #tasha# #tasha# hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs [lah]
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set [what] knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay [lah]
it belongs to #tasha# or belongs to her
then it should be able to [lah] and #tasha# use
should be [lah] it's kids size [what]
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
[eh] she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
<malay>tak boleh</malay> loose out <malay>ke dia</malay>
<malay>dia takleh kalah</malay> you understand or not
<malay>dia</malay>
that's why <malay>dia main</malay> game <malay>dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah</malay> I <malay>rasa dah</malay> better [lah] <malay>sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam</malay> #iman# <malay>main nak menang</malay>
<malay>kalah nangis</malay>
(err) going #bishan# on friday

#haris# #haris# #haris# coughing
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>semalam</malay> I think <malay>dah kurang</malay> [ah]
<malay>nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum</malay> they they <malay>dia orang minum air putih</malay>
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you [lah] see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast [lah]
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway [lah] but she haven't message me
I think she's coming from #sengkang# I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later <malay>si</malay> #mas# <malay>ni</malay>
#peck seah# P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start (err) preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time [lah] the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind [ah] if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
they've prepared so much so half a year later <malay>baru dah</malay> towards the end <malay>nak nak nak</malay> <malay>dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat</malay>
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
<malay>kalau tak nanti kelam kabut</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
but they have they have tuition [what]
#amirah's# (err) siblings they have tuition
[ah]
I thought #amirah# go for (err) (oo) visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
(uh) but math class
my only worry is #nadia's# math I mean ya now she's average [ah] but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
because the thing is for me <malay>dia punya</malay> the the the problem sum [lah]
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance

I don't mind [lah]
at least if we start her early because we started #tasha# like only in P five
right started #tasha# with five
