it was okay [lah] (um) they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that (err) they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there [jer] !siala! what is my five year plan
<malay>nak buat apa</malay> five year <malay>aku tak tahu aku cakap macam</malay> [oh] definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role [lah] but you know like also like <malay>macam</malay> okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
(err) there's a position that opens up in a different department and (um) my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to [ah]
I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>nak cakap</malay>
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay (mm) answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
<malay>kau jawab apa</malay>
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees [ah] sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like [oh]
I aspire to inspire <malay>kau nampak</malay> <malay>kau nampak</malay>
yes so [ah] I had like three interviews and then (um) so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews (err) no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so (um) I felt that <malay>macam</malay> this company is [kan] and and
but it gives me a very nice (err)
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know (err) where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like <malay>macam</malay> like !siala! I want go interview but I scared [sia] yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
[oh] long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long [oh] they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can (err) I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like [oh] I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like [eh] so what you want do you for five years [ah] [ah] you know like you like you could say like !huh! five years [ah] !wah! I never really think about it [eh] and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also (err)
you also answer like [oh] never really think about it [eh] but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long [lah] but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer [lah] so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say [ah] [oh] [ah] I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee (um) so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve (um) more things
which is true I I think it's also like (um) I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that [oh] (err) in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K [oh] you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you [eh] I give you three point five [lah] you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic [what] so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain</malay> then <malay>bila aku cari kerja lain</malay> I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that <malay>macam</malay>
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different (um) setting it's all about how you make it (um) you make it work in the in in this stuff [kan] [lah] fourteen december
very much so yes okay [lah] no look my training ground is actually quite far <malay>tapi aku aku fikir panjang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> five year plan [kan] <malay>aku fikir</malay> five plan <malay>dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun</malay> okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] <malay>satu tahun</malay> then coming july <malay>dua tahun</malay>
<malay>cepat juga</malay> [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! all the job demands <malay>macam</malay> I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] <malay>beberapa macam</malay>
<malay>berlega sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam</malay> everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like [oh] like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that (um)
I don't want to be too greedy [lah] like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale !wah! that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack [ah] but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
but I really wanted that #tengah# estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five <malay>jauh</malay> [seh]
because my fiance <malay>dia tak ada</malay> passion <malay>nak pergi sangat</malay> to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
yes I know your work right (um) about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
(err)
not not like what's in it for you but more of <malay>macam</malay>
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
(uh) role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem [kan] so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny <malay>macam</malay> we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy [ah] you know I want to save money [ah] now now tough time [lah] cannot spend [lah]
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists <malay>bukan bukan</malay> local <malay>aku takut</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [bah] certain certain countries can come in singapore already [what]
so <malay>macam</malay> like a the same thing [lah] okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot [lah] no cannot spend [lah] now (err) must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say [lah] hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like !wah! you say this kind of things [ah]
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and (err) we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household [lah] but you know on an average
(mm)
average family probably would have one [lah] fashion <malay>jenama</malay> big brand it's like that two iconic brand [lah] <malay>orang</malay> queue [lah] <malay>kat luar</malay> (uh) (uh) okay you know and chanel
<malay>orang</malay> people queue [lah] [sia] <malay>kat luar</malay> people queue people queue outside and these are some of the people who queues outside their store come up to my stores with paper bags of their stores and come to my store asking me [eh] got discount !walao! [eh] you buy [eh] you buy chanel then come to my store and then ask me for discount
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand !wow!
!wow!
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
yes but you can always cancel but you can always cancel your subscription <malay>apa</malay> in subscription
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up [lah] I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel [lah] but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account [eh] there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically (um)
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't (err) I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say [oh] it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website (err) can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account [eh] you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
[oh] yes okay okay okay <malay>boleh boleh boleh</malay> easy easy easy
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting (um) this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
