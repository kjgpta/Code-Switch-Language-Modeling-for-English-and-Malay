(mmhmm) !wow!
<malay>leceh</malay> [ah] <malay>leceh</malay>
(mm) okay I see I see [eh] (uh) but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long [eh]
(uh)
[oh] for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like [ah] twenty four hours [ah] so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like !huh! forty eight hours <malay>lama gila</malay>
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
like the questions <malay>banyak ke</malay> like were there like a lot of questions
!wow! five sections
(mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm) not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
no difference <malay>tak ada tak ada</malay> difference
like why you using serious <malay>tak dengar</malay>
try [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something
ya is it what you using
(mm) cause it sounds like (uh) (err) <malay>dia macam tak</malay> clear <malay>sangat</malay> so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
(mm)
(mm) that's why
okay never mind
can [lah] but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>sangat</malay> what you trying to say ya
like there's like a bit like
blur blur <malay>sikit</malay>
anyway right (um)
[oh] for me [kan] [ah] yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was [ah] twenty four hours <malay>tapi</malay> like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction [tau] like the instruction were like very specific so
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
eleven questions and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) the eleven questions <malay>tu</malay> like [ah] the marks were different [lah] for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks [ah] so like (um)
[ah] for like for each question (err) (um) my lecturer specified [ah] like (um) <malay>berapa banyak</malay> words
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then (um) [ah] she also specified [lah] like (um) the (uh)
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like (um) <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> make <malay>tak</malay> make sense [ah] cause like (err) questions two marks [jer] <malay>atau</malay> three marks but like (uh) <malay>dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> (um) the words like limit <malay>dia</malay> like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard [ah] I I don't know it's like (um) it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that (um)
we had to like really (um) arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like (um) time consuming [lah] [ah] which explains why maybe she like <malay>kasi</malay> us twenty four hours <malay>untuk buat</malay>
ya
eleven essays
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like <malay>tak tidur</malay> cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between [ah] but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of (um) the the the the submission period
[lah] cause I cause I honestly feel that (um) the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
ya and then then <malay>nanti</malay> last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like (err) everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what (um) like for for me that the twenty four hours (uh) <malay>punya</malay> exam it was like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it was <malay>penat</malay> [ah] but then like
but then like (uh) how do I say this <malay>dia macam</malay>
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say [kan] it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like (uh) my back was like crying for help
my back crying for help and then ya and (um) like <malay>mata sakit</malay> and everything so <malay>macam</malay> (err) no it's not very like ya it's the worst [ah] I would say the whole the whole
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your (um) attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like (err) I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse [eh] and then like (um) like like like (uh)
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you [ah] I expected like worse cause I feel like (um) some of the modules they were like quite (uh) heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very (um) drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like (mm) like I was quite satisfied with (um) my results [lah] cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being (uh) quite lenient [lah]
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think <malay>boleh lepas</malay>
ya ya
ya
cause like you know you know there are times like (um) (uh) like I I attended like online lectures but then like <malay>macam</malay> like I was there but I was asleep
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[eh] you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
ya ya ya serious <malay>tak bedek</malay>
all okay cause I had this like (um) [ah] I <malay>ada kelas ni</malay> eight thirty [tau] eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your <malay>macam</malay> sleeping schedule <malay>semua</malay> all over the place [kan] like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late <malay>lepastu</malay> like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like (uh) (um) the what <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link [ah] I would join <malay>lepastu</malay> the minute I join and then like right [ah] <malay>terus</malay> I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think (uh) I <malay>bukan sorang</malay> cause [ah] when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like <malay>macam</malay>
cannot [ah]
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already (um) not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] online like <malay>tak boleh</malay> !oi!
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> lecturers you <malay>semua</malay> like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>juga</malay> with certain lecturers
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh) (uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) <malay>faham</malay>
[ah] cause
for me like [ah] for me right (um)
most of my lecturers okay [lah] I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's <malay>semua benda macam</malay> very <malay>baru untuk semua orang</malay>
I think everyone <malay>macam masih nak</malay> adapting to the whole new situations so it's like (uh) I I appreciate that (uh) lecturers I <malay>macam</malay> they were they were okay [lah] but then I did have <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>dengan</malay> some
lecturers [ah] cause like I don't know why [ah] <malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like I <malay>ada satu</malay> lecturer <malay>ni</malay> she was like (um)
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why [ah] cause I've I I I don't (err) I don't <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole (um) the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
(um) cause it's online [kan] <malay>abeh macam</malay> she doesn't
she expects us to (err) <malay>macam</malay>
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean <malay>faham</malay> [lah] we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it wasn't helpful [lah] she was expecting us to only come to her only <malay>bila kita ada</malay> questions so it was like very hard for me like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just <malay>balik</malay> singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
she was like as like for like every week
[ah] <malay>dia akan cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia akan cakap</malay> okay this is the topic we're going to [ah] this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
on our own so <malay>macam</malay> I was like [ah] it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is [lah] to to understand to <malay>faham</malay> [kan]
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy (um) course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students [ah] I I honestly feel that way I mean
I I understand that she she wants like <malay>kita nya</malay> level to be like of really university students <malay>tapi macam</malay>
[ah] in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful [lah]
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very <malay>leceh</malay> like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were <malay>macam banyak gila benda nak kena</malay> like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very <malay>leceh</malay> and then like
it was very <malay>leceh</malay> and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause (uh) (uh) I had to handle <malay>dengan</malay> all those (um) group members who are just useless
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
working team members which was hard [lah] cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> equally divided [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
so I was like [ah] it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like (um) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] want to <malay>layan</malay> like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress [ah] of it but you know some did some did not so it was like [ah] whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> then <malay>dorang punya pasal</malay> [ah]
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like [ah] whatever [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah] <malay>nak buat pape pun boleh</malay> [lah] ya like ya it's like
like <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> like you know like <malay>bila</malay> physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
especially when like
(um) like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating [kan]
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
(um) and then (uh) like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours [ah] similar to yours like <malay>dorang kasi kita</malay> choose (um) <malay>nak apa tu nak</malay> individual <malay>atau</malay> group work so it was like okay [lah] I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own (uh) I mean it's kind of scary [lah] to do be doing assignments like individually <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean [kan] like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so <malay>macam</malay> settle [lah] <malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>habis cerita</malay> [eh] but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester

like you see when like people really like speak up on like (uh) like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam</malay> [eh] like !ee! I really like like at the back of my head [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there were like a lot of things [tau] I really want to say a lot of things but then like I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like (uh)
it's like ya I mean I know what to say
okay [what]
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya cause for me right (um) I I I sometimes that I really I know what to say I know what to say it's just that I don't know if I will be able to word it in a way that people understand where I'm coming from you know
[ah] (uh) ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I I feel that (um) my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like (um) follow up on what what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really <malay>macam</malay> go out there and speak up about things like this [ah]
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like (um) people reply and they have like (err) like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like [oh] no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
ya ya ya I mean like for me <malay>macam kadang-kadang</malay> like I feel I <malay>takut kat walaupun</malay>
my my twitter is like private like private account <malay>tapi</malay>
!huh! <malay>tapi</malay> I I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
[kan]
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly [oh] really I mean then
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah] yes yes yes
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words [kan] like you don't want to <malay>macam</malay> you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like (um) discussion like a healthy one [lah] like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like <malay>macam</malay> very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter [ah]
ya ya I mean
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say <malay>macam</malay> go to newspaper [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(um) sometimes sometimes
sometimes <malay>memang</malay> (mm) (mm) sometimes <malay>memang</malay> tired [ah] actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you I don't know sometimes I feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like [ah] sometimes I feel like [ah] I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like (uh) just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like [oh] okay can can already [ah] then you know activate back and then like okay already

ya cause
I
[ah] I <malay>lebih</malay> prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which <malay>macam</malay> I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I <malay>tak</malay> sure [ah] whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like [ah] similar [lah] to your parents my parents <malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] so ya
<malay>dorang macam [ah] <malay>cari sendiri</malay> they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
I mean I would say my non-existent love life [lah] as of right now
so ya
maybe maybe maybe if I'm like desperate enough then maybe [lah]
maybe like really like reach a certain age then I think I should get married and I don't have anyone then maybe [ah] I will resort to that but like
(um) I <malay>nak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about [ah]
like I think I have other things to like think about like right now like like I need I need to figure out what I want to do with my degree
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first [lah] then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like <malay>sekarang</malay> to have love life like right now
it's like (mm) not much ideal for me [ah] cause I feel that I don't even have time for myself like I'm just so busy with school so like to to have like someone in my life right now it's like (um)
ya it's not that it's going to distract me [ah] it's just that I don't I don't know if I can actually fully commit to it you know
ya it's more of that cause like you know obviously school would come first I just so busy with school I'll just be so caught up with school I don't think I would have time for my significant other if I were to ever have one like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so (um) <malay>malas</malay> [lah] also like
