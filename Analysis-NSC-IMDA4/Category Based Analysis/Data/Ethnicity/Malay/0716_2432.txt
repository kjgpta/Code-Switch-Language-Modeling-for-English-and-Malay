ya so it's like (err) I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
[ah] ya like it's just like <malay>macam</malay> background noise <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay> I I mean the content okay <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like the some documentaries there was one with (um) that girl #dalila# I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ya that one was quite interesting
[ah] #dalina# #dalina# during <malay>bulan puasa</malay> [ah] <malay>bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>sebelum buka</malay> then <malay>baru</malay> will watch
<malay>kalau tak macam</malay> (err)

ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to [oh] okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says [ah] which is very true everything is on demand
[ah]
[oh] my goodness
[oh] my goodness <malay>mentang-mentang ada</malay> library [eh] <malay>kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki</malay> [eh] ya

<malay>abeh apa</malay> [oh] [lah] horse ya #allah#
<malay>anjing</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>cantik</malay>
<malay>cantik</malay> [seh] babe is that #ros# in the photo
[oh] ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
okay
ya
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] <malay>kau mengarut</malay>
<malay>aku</malay>
pessimistic as in about your relationship
(uh huh) (uh huh)
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
[oh] okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
[oh] okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about <malay>kalau</malay> you [dah] age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house [what]
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more [lah] cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying [oh] I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married [meh] no need to buy <malay>ke</malay> you know ya then still spend money [what]
ya
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] no then <malay>sekarang</malay> are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
<malay>aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau</malay> robert <malay>kalau</malay> !alah! <malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>sebab kau rasa macam</malay> robert you know would have the financial means
I don't know but #ros# also
but the think is russell financial means are also above average <malay>jadi</malay> you know <malay>apa yang tak cukup ni</malay> sorry <malay>kau</malay>
[oh] like you yourself okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
is it <malay>dia</malay>
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole [lah] also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
right but then cause of COVID and then they say [oh] people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya [lah] <malay>rasa takut tu mesti ada</malay> right <malay>sikit</malay>
!huh!
[a'ah]
ya
what [oh] no but [eh] five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya [lah] there's your savings
[oh] okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount <malay>berapa</malay>
[eh] thirty three <malay>dengan</malay> hundred <malay>jauh beza</malay> [seh]
dope okay [lah] hundred plus
okay [eh] then okay [eh] not so bad [eh] hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan [ah] is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus [lah]
!wah! that is okay [lah] <malay>tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat</malay> collect then
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
ya two percent then <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] just pay [lah] five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest [what] cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it [lah]
<malay>tahu tahu</malay>
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from [kan]
[ah] okay okay can [lah]
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
[oh] no
(mm)
(mm) (mm)

the house is a better investment ya correct
[eh] actually you don't need [lah] you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya [lah]
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that [lah] but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya [lah] a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the

it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see [lah] #inshaallah# [lah] and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee [lah] like (um) you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me [lah] they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
but haven't found like my <malay>tudung</malay> style you know it's stressful cause you have to iron
ya
[ah]
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
that's all ya and okay I I think in in the first place also <malay>dia macam malas</malay> [ah] <malay>nak keluar pun</malay>
<malay>sebab dia baru balik kerja</malay> [kan] the night before
ya I also think so and then and then he just <malay>melenting</malay> you know
ya cause like <malay>dia terus nak cari</malay> excuse [ah] then he can just say he don't want to go right
his family I mean his sister asked me [lah] I told his sister [lah] the truth

<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
he's okay if cause for #hanan# right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually #hanan# is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work [what]
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also [lah] but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like #hidayat# will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
like one hour <malay>gitu hidayat</malay> will actually wake up early to play with him
cause <malay>hanan subuh dah bangun</malay>
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
<malay>dia macam faham dia tengok upin</malay> and <malay>ipin</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia ketawa</malay>
ya [lah] but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
I just scared he feels like [eh] <malay>mak aku tak sayang aku</malay> [eh] <malay>asyik-asyik nak tinggalkan aku kat tempat merata-rata dunia</malay>
<malay>bukannya dia kerja pun dia duduk rumah pun dia tinggalkan aku kat rumah nenek aku</malay> [lah] <malay>opah aku</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian aku budak kecil</malay> I mean if he's thinking that way but ya mum's guilt
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
ya so I will be boiling it for five hours <malay>entahlah macam mana</malay> it will turn out
but like plain
no salt no what
<malay>belum</malay> [ah]
ya he <malay>pernah</malay> start <malay>aku kasih dia makan</malay>
now (um) next week [ah]
next week <malay>dia boleh makan bubur dah</malay>
like <malay>dia dah</malay> six months plus
so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
ya
ya hopefully
<malay>dah besar dah boleh duduk dah esok dia pergi dah</malay>
but #hidayat# and me are like no [lah] I think I think #hanan# will be the one and only cause <malay>penat</malay> [sia] <malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> I don't know [ah] it's just so so tiring like where do people get the energy from you know
maybe
!huh! I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
<malay>aku dah tiga puluh tahun pun mak aku</malay> still come in to to help me so much
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
!hais!
ya until we die until you die or they die first whoever dies first you know <malay>khalas</malay> we're done

I don't like the way they talk
on
<malay>lepak</malay> one <malay>korner</malay>
I feel like they always <malay>sindir</malay> <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kita tak pakai bahasa kesat kita kita kita kita apa</malay> [eh]
I don't know [ah] what they say but they always say like they they are not <malay>kesat</malay> when they are disrespectful blah blah blah then that's your brand [lah] no need to say other people [what]
you know and then they they are like two guys and then they are not really like guys you know the #zuhairi# right he's a bit soft so he's like <malay>nyah aku rasa aku tak akan bayar hantaran</malay> and all these things
you know then then the other guy will be like [oh] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>itu pasal kita orang tak kahwin</malay> you know
<malay>apa apa</malay> [lah] they are so they are so <malay>lokek</malay> they come across as so <malay>lokek</malay>
ya no don't don't even bother I tried giving them a chance it just makes my blood boil
ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with #aisyah# his girlfriend #aisyah aziz#
it was okay [lah] but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like [oh] you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows [what] his girlfriend is #aisyah aziz#
like hello
[oh] (mm) (mm)
ya
ya correct correct
and the chemistry is just not there right
like
(mm) ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is #dzar# who carries the conversation right with the
people like #razz# will
[a'ah]
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually #dzar# can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no [lah]
#din# doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that [oh] okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least #dzar# has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct
[ah] [ah] [ah] like what's the point you join right
<malay>dia macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>agaknya sebab dia baru ada</malay> baby but I don't know man but even before that
