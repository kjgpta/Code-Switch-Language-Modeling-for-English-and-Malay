yeah so total hour <malay>setengah</malay>
[oh] so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes <malay>mandi</malay>
(uh)
[oh] okay okay
so you went swimming for three days
I was thinking like why why what can you do for swimming for three days there's nothing much on top there it's super cold in the morning right did you go to the morning [one] no
[ah]
I was
<malay>hujan</malay>
[eh] so you went in already then rain or what
then you <malay>kena keluar</malay>
[oh] it wasn't heavy rain [ah] it wasn't like lightning storm kind of thing [ah]
it's just a drizzle [lah]
is it then they still allow <malay>tak de</malay> lightning warning [eh]
[oh] okay but were were you cold
cause I remember when I went right Kelly wanted me to go swimming what in the morning she's like let's go in the morning [ah] then then I like I went in to the pool I just wanna go home already I was freezing inside the pool it was so cold I was like Kelly Kelly Kelly Kelly I like I keep stuttering in the in the pool cause like I just want to leave I just want to take like a hot bath after that
it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
(mm)
<malay>masuk dalam atau jalan je</malay>
[oh]
<malay>ramai</malay>
[oh] okay
[ah] yeah yeah [lah] true [lah]
(mm)
is it is it now <malay>sekarang</malay> the the design is it like moon festival or what
[oh] so when you went it's just messy [lah] is it
[ah] nothing much
okay
(mm)
yeah [lah] I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right <malay>dia punya</malay> aircon [kan] <malay>like sejuk gila nya</malay> then I was like okay let's go in relax <malay>tengok bunga</malay> okay then then I go home
I mean like I I understand that I need to go out like every every week cause if not I feel very like stuck at home
!wah! during during pandemic was the worst [lah] that I have to be stuck at home <malay>boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang</malay> !oof!
(mm)
it's nice to go out with your family and staycay [lah]
what
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> you say what you say
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred [ah] no
!wah! so expensive
!oof!
try different hotels [kan]
this staycay in Singapore quite fun [lah] especially when you go with family or friends
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay <malay>dengan kawan sekolah</malay> but then the pandemic happened and then every place just <malay>kena</malay> abandon [sia]
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore <malay>pun susah tapi tak</malay> [pe] [lah] I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
yeah
[eh] why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
[oh] never got reply [ah]
(oo) my friend got Coffee Bean then I like (uh) I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong [lah] she might hear wrong [what] that's why I scared
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me <malay>bilang</malay> (err) #Nisha# you need to work thirty three hours per week <malay>baru boleh</malay> earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense [lah]
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work <malay>lapan</malay> hours a day for <malay>empat hari</malay> right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours [lah] you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean <malay>nak</malay> hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista [lah]
yeah <malay>dia sekarang</malay> she she's just a temperature screener <malay>jaga burung dekat</malay> outside [jer]
yeah but okay [lah] she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
(mm) yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can <malay>kacau</malay> her after that
but you <malay>kau nak</malay> start <malay>sekolah</malay> soon right
yea like November ya October [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay>
November [oh] my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
but then the results [dah] <malay>keluar</malay> [eh] like your whether you can get into the school
[oh] very long [eh]
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find [what] you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
[kan]
then sometimes <malay>kau pun macam</malay> <malay>malas</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari lagi</malay>
yeah normal [lah] I mean you also not very like <malay>apa orang cakap</malay> like (err) what is the word [ah] [oh] <malay>main main</malay> blank like <malay>tak cerewet</malay> like that [lah]
are you <malay>cerewet</malay> no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
(mm)
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years [eh] (err) like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much [sia]
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
(mm)
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before [lah] <malay>aku pernah main dengan kawan</malay> poly I was like I want play [seh] like like I just want to play
<malay>dua orang aja</malay>
you need you need you need minimum <malay>lima orang</malay> [eh]
can ask like
(mm) can ask our secondary school <malay>punya kawan</malay>
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's #Nisha# it's #Nisha# I'm like [oh] no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
(mm)
(mm)
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend [lah] there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then <malay>dia datang</malay> she always follow me you know <malay>dia</malay> always next to me <malay>sebelah aku aje</malay> then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that <malay>kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics [lah]
then once someone [kan] <malay>dia</malay> have to like discover the body
yeah then <malay>dia</malay> report body <malay>aku</malay> then <malay>dia bilang</malay> !wah! I found #Nisha's# body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like [oh] my god this this this girl this then I just keep <malay>maki</malay> on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep <malay>maki</malay> her like !wah! this this girl [ah] she's lying so well [ah] and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like (ugh) it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like (ugh) I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
(mm)
yeah
(mm)
(mm)
what
you can hide the body
!wah!
I didn't know you can hide the body !wah! I should I should try
(mm)
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after (err) intruder can like like <malay>kacau dia punya</malay> system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things [lah] so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand <malay>dekat</malay> machine <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
yeah [lah] cause this one you can like <malay>ada</malay> van then you can like <malay>apa ada mission juga</malay> you can see everyone instead I would mafia game [kan] <malay>macam kau kena tunggu</malay> the time only
then it's quite it can get quite <malay> macam bosan</malay> [lah]
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently <malay>kalau kita semua main</malay> UNO <malay>semua</malay> right it was it was quite fun [lah] honestly
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games [eh] ya
I'm hungry man I like [oh] you're craving for meat [ah] but you're not a meat person right <malay>kau tak boleh makan</malay>
is it all meat or is it just (err) beef
!wah!
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
<malay>kenyal-kenyal</malay> ox man
<malay>bau dia</malay>
I I won't be surprised right if you [dah] <malay>kawin</malay> then <malay>kau beranak</malay> [kan] then you like beef suddenly
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
are <malay>kau serius ke</malay>
funny [lah] usually pregnancy [kan] <malay>macam</malay> unknown unknown cravings
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I thought I thought you said <malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>ikan</malay> is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like (uh) (err) !huh!
yeah
[oh] my god I want I want I recently was talking to #Yin Shen# about picnic then suddenly <malay>nak dia nak main layang</malay> [kan] because since that last year want play <malay>layang</malay> already
then I was like [oh] can we go picnic then then he said like okay <malay>kau nak join tak</malay> we go picnic but
what but what <malay>apa</malay>
like currently <malay>dia nye</malay> holiday <malay>bulan</malay> [eh] it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we <malay>pergi Isnin</malay>
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can <malay>bincang</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> <malay>dia orang selalu dia orang</malay> uni course <malay>sama</malay> [eh]
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni <malay>sama</malay>
(mmhmm)
they <malay>dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape</malay>
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
no [lah] I mean you can meet [lah] but if you wanna meet every week <malay>macam penat</malay> [kan] <malay>nak</malay> meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
(mm)
they're waiting for you
I mean they were they were nice enough to <malay>tunggu tunggu kau punya reply</malay> [lah]
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that [lah] but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan [lah]
(hmm)
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly <malay>punya kawan</malay> [lah] like I also got bad experiences with like <malay>kawan</malay> poly <malay>semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda</malay> then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer [what] you guys <malay>nak makan yang tak halal</malay> then then <malay>kau</malay> invite <malay>aku buat apa</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
I hate it I <malay>aku tak aku tak suka</malay> [eh] <malay>paling benci aku</malay> when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no !wah! I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that [oh] we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
I'm like !wah! <malay>paling benci</malay> [sia] <malay>aku dengar apa</malay> that that phrase
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right <malay>nak nak jumpa dua orang</malay> like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
(mm)
(mm)
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort <malay>keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa</malay> then <malay>kena pakai bus nye</malay> card <malay>lagi</malay> bus transportation for adult fare is so much
yeah
[eh]
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
!wah!
[eh] <malay>kak aku tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau naik bus</malay> [kan] straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then <malay>aku naik bus aja</malay> is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now [ah]
yeah cause like <malay>kalau aku naik</malay> bus <malay>satu jam</malay> [eh] if I take also around forty five fifty minutes [kan] it's around the same time <malay>tapi</malay> like which one will be cheaper
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology <malay>dengan benda lain</malay> [kan] I don't know [ah] Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
I think that will be more useful [lah] in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that [lah]
<malay>tapi nak tunggu bus tengah</malay> crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi [kan]
(um) I mean (hmm) continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first [ah]
(mm)
(hmm) but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one <malay>dengan anjing</malay> [kan]
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help [what]
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
(uh) (mm)
(um) especially <malay>nak naik nak naik</malay> <malay>ape</malay> transportation [kan] public transport
yeah the yeah
yeah (uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled [lah]
convenience right
<malay>nak senang</malay> [kan] <malay>diorang nya apa diri</malay>
(mm)
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know (err) not one maybe like some it's very sad [lah]
(mm)
yeah
yeah we're so used to having five senses <malay>susah</malay> <malay>nak</malay> compare <malay>dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga</malay> [lah] like we always <malay>kasihankan</malay> but we never do anything right
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in #California# is it #California# or #Oregon# [ah]
forest fire not fighting fire <malay>api</malay>
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week [ah] there is a forest fire <malay>kat</malay> #California# or #Oregon# and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid <malay>diorang tak pakai otak</malay> [eh] it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then <malay>diorang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita nampak langit</malay> [kan] <malay>biru lawa</malay> their <malay>langit</malay> is red [eh]
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay [lah] you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer [lah] that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah [lah]
yeah but imagine [leh] like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then <malay>sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be [lah] that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
really
!wah! what if then they knew when they <malay>dia</malay> were they planning your name to be different
[oh] man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
yeah confirm for that nine months right <malay>diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki</malay> right then suddenly <malay>perempuan keluar</malay> then they on the spot have to think of a girl name [leh]
I didn't know
(hmm)
[oh] boy is a girl joke [lah]
rated
over the top <malay>maksudnya apa</malay>
(mm)
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right
(hmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah man funny [lah]
know yesterday <malay>aku kerja</malay> [kan] sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday <malay>aku kerja</malay> thought it will be crowded [lah] cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B [lah] can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
my own shift yeah

I only serve what two customer
yeah I thought okay [lah] at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded [kan] <malay>tak ada</malay> time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until <malay>pukul sembilan</malay> [eh] then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then <malay>aku tunggu aje</malay> [lah] tunggu</malay> [kan] in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
[dah] <malay>tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang</malay> [eh] I was like okay I just close up everything [ah]
I was so I was like so zoned out yesterday cause it was so quiet I like I want a customer but I also don't really want a customer to come in
[kan] like (err) don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack [leh] <malay>tiga puluh</malay> dollar [eh] it's like twenty seven [eh] I was like [oh] my god this is this this is easy money
I mean like I have to clean the shop still but then like I just sit there do nothing [eh]
literally like zoned out [eh] it was very funny by myself in the shop
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if <malay>kau macam</malay> busy <malay>gila macam selalu ada ramai orang</malay> then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
I think it was very funny yesterday
[eh] then <malay>nyari</malay> Kelly <malay>kerja</malay> [eh]

then then andrew was like no <malay>bukan aku</malay> and I'm like [oh]
Ethelene and Kelly I was so shocked
I mean I mean I it's obvious that it was her cause she's the one who bought the cake to my house right cause if she was trying to hide the damn box behind her back I cannot see when she entered the house and I'm like okay maybe she buy the cake
and then I'm like
but my family said a bit dry but I don't care whether dry or not I care for the frosting the the the the cream cause some I don't really like whipped cream [kan]
cause can get quite <malay>jelak</malay> then I don't then when this one is got flavour [one] that's why I like !wah! this is nice this is very nice

I was really contemplating whether it's okay whether I need a cake then Andrew was like you don't need a cake I was like okay I don't need a cake then I didn't buy a cake
that's why you say you want a cake then I did ask #Yin Shen# cause like I know #Yin Shen# felt left out but I asked in the in our our group chat whether anyone would want a cake
