like I totally forgot about it I was like
okay I'm going to reply her after I <malay>makan</malay>
then like after I <malay>makan</malay> I was like

then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it [lah] I was like
[oh] the is still trying to convince me to like (um) for her
<malay>tapi</malay> like I don't want then I felt like
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
so <malay>semalam</malay> like
I told my mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> was like
we're going out at one
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
to like clean like cause <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err) yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my <malay>almari</malay> from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the <malay>buku-buku</malay>
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>berat gila</malay>
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
and then I shifted all the I I I <malay>simpan</malay> the book <malay>balik</malay>
then I fell asleep
and then what happened to the one <malay>keluar</malay> you know what time we <malay>keluar</malay> or not we went out like
freaking six ya
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to <malay>beli</malay> right
busy you know cause okay
I went to spotlight <malay>sebab</malay> I want to find
<malay>kain</malay>
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to <malay>jahit</malay> for my
family members [kan]
which <malay>tak habis-habis</malay>
ya so I was trying to find a breathable <malay>kain</malay>
then
(err)
but my another
main thing that I wanted to <malay>cari</malay> was the
dress patterns [lah] the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
[kan]
so
the first thing I did was
like find the <malay>kain</malay>
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and (err) and then like (uh) I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
turns out it was like <malay>dekat dalam</malay>
an <malay>almari</malay>
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was
no one was attending to me [ah] so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it [lah]
ya
ya
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> while while bathing I was
hello
that's call cheat
<malay>cik saya nak</malay> order
<malay>nak</malay> order <malay>suji boleh</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> usually like people sell <malay>suji</malay> that
small [kan]
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
as I was saying <malay>tadi</malay>
like while I was
bathing
I was trying to think <malay>macam</malay> like
(err) when is a good time for us to record [lah] cause <malay>macam</malay>
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that [kan]
at five <malay>masih</malay> very very very <malay>memekak</malay>
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that !huh! like the the motor and the and the cars are like
<malay>memekak gila</malay>
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
crowded here and because that time <malay>masa masa</malay> we shot at kim <malay>punya</malay> place
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tempat jin bertandang</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
<malay>yang</malay> we went to jewel [eh] I think
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
(mmhmm)
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with #irfan# #zahidah#
like all my close friends I only like <malay>keluar</malay> with the for like
once every
twice a month or something
like <malay>satu bulan</malay> [eh] no <malay>dua bulan sekali</malay> kind of thing you know
or like <malay>tiga bulan sekali</malay>
!huh!
[oh] [ah]
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>apa</malay>
give it a listen <malay>nanti lepas ni</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
I think the korean industry is kind of like <malay>macam</malay>
like it's quite
<malay>apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
like hats off to them [lah]
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay [kan]
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
and it's damn big it's like <malay>besar gila</malay> and
it looks very
real [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you know some some sets you know that it's a set [kan]
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
(err)
it's really
[oh] my god (uh) I cannot (uh) my brain is like fried it's really impressive [lah]
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big [lah] in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts [lah] [hor]
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
[eh] buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
(mmhmm)
ya ya
makes sense food
[ah] !aiya! okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
<malay>pakai yang</malay> the one that I told you about <malay>hari tu</malay> that it <malay>karat</malay>
so the reason why it's
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> it's like one for one
and then
(um) when I was buying it I was like thinking <malay>kenapa dia punya</malay>
<malay>kenapa orang nak kena ada</malay> promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
one for one specs [lah] like at at that point of time I was like thinking
[oh] it's a good deal cause like <malay>macam</malay>
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free [lah] for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so (um)
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
(err)
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument [eh] discussion between me and my
mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> [ah]
like we were like
<malay>patutlah dia jual</malay> one for one
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> specs <malay>tak guna</malay>
like
then I was like <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] cause like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that [lah] but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
your degree <malay>naik</malay> or something right
I don't know
is it just <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> to me
and
it all
like
ya
<malay>macam</malay>
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures [pe] ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
(err)
if you see [ah] the people who who buy glasses from owndays [kan] they also keep on changing their glasses
then my <malay>kakak</malay> cause my <malay>kakak</malay> was telling me [ah] that (um) celebrities who
share that <malay>dia orang beli</malay> their glasses from owndays like they keep on <malay>macam</malay> promoting owndays that means like
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
glasses (um) spectacle shops are following following it [lah]
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that [kan] usually [ah] specs
specs shop is <malay>dekat dalam</malay> the display then you have to like engage the
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
is on display everything at <malay>macam</malay> the racks then you just take and <malay>tak payah</malay>
<malay>tak payah apa nama dia</malay>
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
like the the shop that I went to <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia dia dia dia</malay> I sound like I'm singing [oh] my god
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try [lah] so that they can sanitise [kan]
and then
while waiting for them to fix my <malay>kakak punya</malay> glasses
I was looking at like other customers [ah] and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know [ah]
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
like <malay>berani gila</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also [ah] the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because <malay>macam</malay>
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
they have to let the migrant workers work <malay>sebab</malay> of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also [lor] I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
(mm)
ya
[oh] my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
[oh] ya talking about it
ya
talking about <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (um)
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you [sia] I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like [oh] my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I <malay>masuk</malay> then I was like what is all these two faced people
like writing
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced <malay>macam</malay>
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it [lah] ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
<malay>macam</malay> that
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype [kan]
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing [lah] like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
but then you only do a little like <malay>sikit</malay>
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like !huh! why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
but like playing with stocks are like <malay>macam</malay> gambling [ah]
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
<malay>naik</malay> or <malay>turun</malay>
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
my <malay>nenek</malay> sheryl was sharing with me [ah] that like
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
(mm)
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual [lah]
and their self control I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
!huh!
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised [lah] cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into [lah] to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
so my mind is literally <malay>macam</malay> peanut
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
<malay>macam</malay> there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some <malay>merepek</malay> content
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting [lah] cause like
they keep on
giving you
different (um)
different tiktoks everyday [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like it like within
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
<malay>nanti</malay> it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
and stuff like that and and like to reach out (err) to a bigger audience but <malay>macam</malay>
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
like I <malay>masuk</malay> also to <malay>tengok</malay> what people
no I <malay>masuk</malay> to <malay>tengok</malay> like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to <malay>macam</malay>
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing [lah]
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(uh huh)
maybe that's why you've been seeing #jufri#
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
I have no idea
(mmhmm)
ya
also cause I go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
it's so weird
and when guys do that is like <malay>tak ada perempuan lain ke</malay>
like as in <malay>macam</malay>
like to me right it's like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like you already like cling onto like someone
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
try everyone else <malay>macam</malay>
dude
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[oh] my god
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
I guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
<malay>macam</malay> like common ya
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they are <malay>macam</malay>
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
!ee! I hate guys like that
(uh huh) like
[ah]
(mmhmm)
!ee!
<malay>suruh dia kahwin</malay> chef [ah]
and and the thing is
each like
<malay>apa nama dia</malay>
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan</malay>
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
[ah]
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
(mmhmm)
like even if they don't have
even if they don't have like long term <malay>macam</malay> five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel <malay>macam</malay>
they should have at least like a one year plan <malay>kalau tak macam</malay>
what you <malay>menganggur</malay>
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
[oh] I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it [oh] <malay>serahkan pada</malay> like #allah# and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your <malay>usaha</malay> man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
<malay>habis nanti</malay> like if if you say that
if you <malay>tegur</malay> them about it right <malay>nanti dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like [oh] you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that [lah] ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
about himself
no [lah] I'm pretty sure you will find someone [lah]
maybe maybe not a #muzmatch# cause like I get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay I say I say that that's shallow right but I'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height
like
did I tell you
did I tell you
the first time <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
when I when I moved to telegram [kan]
[ah] he asked me [lah] [oh] what's your height
then I was like one six three you
and then
he was like I'm one six one
then me
who was like cause like his his profile he put there <malay>macam</malay>

I was like [oh] he is one eight one that's tall then I was like (oo) I'm going to talk to him <malay>sebab dia tinggi</malay> and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
and then when he said he was one six one right I was like [oh]
okay smiley face and then
and then he was like I'm joking
then I was like [ah]

ya it's so funny
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya I know how it feels
legit
ya
maybe like
other girls
ya other girls did it
ya
[oh] my god it's it's a technique I use to like make myself look smaller
but mine isn't bottom up because bottom up will make me look like super tall
so it's just like
like <malay>atas sikit</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> like a higher angle you know
<malay>habis macam ternaik sikit</malay>
is like that so I look slim
