yes cute <malay>gila</malay> please <malay>bulu mata</malay> [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> (oo)
ya that what I was thinking
[eh]
[a'ah] <malay>dah habis haus sangat tapi macam nak kencing sekarang</malay> [eh]
just over there
(mm)
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
[ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay>
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also [lah]
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I guess it's the same feeling as like taking a play but you can see everything I <malay>apa</malay> [ah] just like I cannot
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
[ah] how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
[ah] about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time [oh] !wow! yet
amazing [ah]
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
<malay>itu</malay> front stab
want to stab yes
[oh] please [ah]

I can be anything I want
I want to break free
!wah! what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing

but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
(mm)
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this

(mm)
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers (um)
(mmhmm)

a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know

like you know like
what are the right ways to do it [lah] basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow

investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
