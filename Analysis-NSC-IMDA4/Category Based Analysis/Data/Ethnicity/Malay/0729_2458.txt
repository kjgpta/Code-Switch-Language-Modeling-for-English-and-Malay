<malay>kau buat apa</malay> the whole day
[oh] world of married
what is it about
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like #Syamsul Yusof# right
I feel very sad for him [seh] cause like he's like my favourite
then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu</malay> yang <malay>dia akan cerai</malay> with <malay>dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>isteri</malay> right
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life [seh]
(hmm)
but I don't know [eh] cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then (um)
actually I don't know <malay>asal dorang</malay> break up [ah] [eh] <malay>asal dorang nak</malay>
<malay>cerai</malay> everything
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
(uh) children I think one of it
(uh) is a guy one is a girl
then (um) I know #Puteri# (uh) which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
(uh) divorce right
it really shows that
maybe #Syamsul# did something [ah] but I don't know [seh]
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like (um)
marriage and everything
and then actually (uh) on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick [eh] but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
!wah! if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
at that point of time <malay>yang aku rasa macam</malay> !wow! he found the one
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
[seh] like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than (um)
like #Syamsul Yusof# all right
I also remember got this
I think
it was just <malay>berapa tahun yang lalu</malay>
you know #Alif Aziz#
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like #Alif# is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
and I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I Bella I <malay>pun</malay> maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
of loving someone who is
toxic
ya they got back together I think time <malay>bulan ramadan</malay> I think they got back together that which make me feel <malay>macam</malay>
why but then bella was saying like [oh]
don't [ah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] judge and everything then I was like (oo) okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
actually that time I <malay>terserempak dia</malay> then when I saw him right
I feel I don't feel (um)
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel <malay>kesian</malay> cause he looks very like
(um) scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
(mm)
but I think it's also because (um) he
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know [ah] <malay>dia kena tangkap pergi</malay> karaoke <malay>dengan</malay> like other girls
I mean the other girls were like not even
(um) saying sorry or anything
[oh] your hair
(um) I don't know [seh] I think you should just
<malay>buat kot</malay> cause like
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya I mean no harm trying [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> if you <malay>tak</malay> try then you'll never know what
ya so you should just go for it [ah]
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
[ah]
from ten to to [eh]
from ten to twelve I have like (uh) group consultation then from twelve onwards is (um) ten minute consultation with my professor then after that [dah] <malay>balik</malay>
ya
but I have a lot to do so
no [lah] like I can <malay>balik</malay> but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> I got like <malay>macam</malay> this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
(uh) should be <malay>kat rumah</malay> [lah] cause <malay>sekolah</malay> like
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
ya no fast (err) there's only one halal malay stall which is <malay>ayam penyet</malay>
(uh) okay [lah] but like I feel like food is nicer
[ah] which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
but it's okay [lah] cause like most of my classes <malay>dia</malay> online
so <malay>kalau</malay> online then I just
foodpanda or what [ah]
ya
[oh] my dance classes [eh]
(um)
okay [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I first <malay>datang</malay> right
I feel a bit <malay>macam</malay> intimidated
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak sabar</malay> I thought that
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>habis kerja</malay> then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
then isn't it better
to have like a sense of security <malay>kat sana</malay>
[oh] ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay [lah]
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
[ah] cause I <malay>rasa</malay> lonely <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
maybe but like I feel that everyone
<malay>macam</malay> cause most of <malay>kita nya</malay> classes online [kan] then <malay>dorang macam kita macam tak ada</malay> that common like bonding for us to make friends and <malay>ni ni semua</malay>
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they #chiong# last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I #chiong# last minute but they all very studious like
the example [eh] <malay>macam kau ada</malay> assignment due on week seven
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>habis</malay> week
three
or week four
<malay>macam</malay> #kanchiong# <malay>habis</malay>
I don't know [seh]
but ya and then
[oh] did I tell you I met
(uh) our soccer friends
<malay>dorang</malay> actually <malay>kat</malay> <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] our captain remember
[ah] <malay>nama dia</malay> start with letter L
and <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> (uh) I think <malay>nama dia</malay> start letter B
ya
ya the same place as me [ah]
[ah] my our campus is
[ah] Dover
ya
ya [oh] my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
you know I I <malay>nak beli baju daripada</malay> Shein you know Shein
is like a
a website [ah] where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review [ah]
ya and I thought of buying it [ah] cause like
I feel like
I <malay>tak ada baju</malay> [seh] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay>
although I <malay>pergi sekolah dua hari</malay> [jer] every week
(mmhmm)
why fifty dollar quite a lot [what]
[oh]
but I think in your
in your like situation <malay>memang susah nak</malay> save [tau] actually
because you only receive like nine hundred [ah] spending money how to save
ya
[eh] I feel that the money that you have
for like <malay>kerja</malay> [kan] is just for you <malay>untuk</malay>
spend for the month
but like maybe okay [lah] not that
direct nine hundred [ah] but like
maybe one hundred you <malay>simpan</malay>
those kind of thing
you know I <malay>rasa macam</malay> this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I've been a snorlax for so long
then <malay>sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>baru bangun</malay>
[dah] <malay>bangun kena kerja keras pula tu</malay>
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
(mm) I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
[orh] for #Anas# [eh]
you know I feel [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> present <malay>kita nak beli</malay> present <malay>untuk lelaki memang susah sebab</malay>
<malay>lelakinya</malay> present <malay>selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu</malay> because <malay>lelaki dorang macam</malay> very practical
ya I mean I feel for #Anas# right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple [eh]
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
cause [eh] I haven't finish <malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
because
<malay>dia tak muat</malay>
okay then <malay>takpe kot</malay>
ya you can buy
can buy him <malay>sabun</malay>
ya I mean if you want it easy then just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] then just (uh) perfume [lah]
(uh) I think it's okay it's just sometimes <malay>dia</malay> very busy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
but at the same time I <malay>rasa dia boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] I mean
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
that time he met #Dakshah# also <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> free
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even #Dakshah# had to ask him out
(mm)
ya that's true
depends [ah]
(uh) a bit of physics but other than that no
!huh! I very like packed with a lot of things [eh] I got I struggling with school <malay>takde</malay> time [ah]
[oh] did mama tell you that
[oh]
but it's really difficult to <malay>ajar</malay> him [seh] cause
(mm)
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also [lah] I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
(um)
parents <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> tau <malay>yang</malay> actually <malay>macam mana nak</malay> handle <malay>budak-budak</malay> and everything
and then they just like feel <malay>yang cikgu yang akan</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> [kan] <malay>budak-budak punya pelajaran</malay> and stuff but
doesn't work that way you know
[oh] he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
[oh] he did !huh! what did he do
[oh]
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
[orh] but how much were you paid per month
!huh! fifty [jer]
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
[oh] my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya [lah] you can say like [oh] you want to help the child everything but !wow!
that progress and also the time spent right
is very taxing <malay>penat</malay> [seh]
I [ah] <malay>boleh</malay>
ya I mean people always <malay>cakap</malay> !alah! [jer] [pe]
but really marks where you can go
to secondary and secondary is like <malay>macam</malay>
the place where you
make it or break it [seh]
ya I mean
I'm kind of thankful <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> a secondary school
<malay>yang</malay> not that <malay>macam</malay>
#minahish# and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
!wah! like you can really see <malay>macam mana orang</malay> turn out to be [seh]
and all the <malay>mats</malay> and <malay>minahs</malay> and
the fact that they start smoking even during <malay>macam</malay> lower sec and doing a lot of other things
it's really scary
actually I scared [seh] <malay>sebab</malay> you know (uh) recently I <malay>nampak kat</malay> news [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
(um) the
<malay>budak kecil</malay> right [eh] not <malay>budak kecil</malay> [ah] like just like lower secondary everything
<malay>dorang</malay> (um) they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase [eh] like it's damn
scary [ah] that how young and how brave are you to do that
[oh] primary school <malay>pun</malay>
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it [seh] like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
social media [ah] <malay>macam</malay> TikTok
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever [seh]
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
and I just <malay>tak faham</malay> [ah] cause like I remember that time
(err) <malay>ada cikgu ni dia datang kat</malay>
me and then <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] like [ah] <malay>jangan buat malu keluarga</malay> [ah] <malay>jaga maruah keluarga</malay>
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua</malay> then I just feel that (err) they don't really understand
and then they just (um) try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
cause secondary school [kan] <malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> [seh] <malay>kita cuma lambat</malay> on the last day of school
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
#Afif# <malay>tak pernah lambat</malay> [ah]
secondary school
[oh] but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
[oh]
[oh] my gosh okay
[ah] why he like that [seh]
you reminded me of our netball coach
<malay>dia pun lagi satu</malay> toxic <malay>nya orang dalam hidup</malay>
how old was she [ah] when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
!wah! early twenties then she act until like that
[oh]
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
cause of her <malay>macam</malay>
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
[oh] when was I there
[oh]
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with [seh]
(mm)
[oh] my god ya it was during like the
(um)
exam [kan]
ya I cannot [seh] <malay>dia</malay> seriously something wrong with her
I mean how we've been overworked
I mean if you realize like those <malay>macam</malay>
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
there were like <malay>macam camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
[oh] I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her [oh] my god
(err)
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma [lah] to be honest
(mm)
(mm) you know I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the best coach <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> right was actually my Singapore poly <malay>nya</malay> coach they were really like
so supportive and stuff
and although I <malay>macam tak datang</malay> training <malay>atau</malay> I not that good [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> still never stop believing in me [seh]
and then <malay>dorang</malay> always <malay>cakap macam</malay> [oh] #Ayra# you can do this blah blah blah like that
ya
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise [kan] actually <malay>tak</malay> healthy <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
flowers <malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>ingat</malay> birthday I <malay>ke</malay>

actually I <malay>suka</malay> mixed [ah] you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know if you know this Instagram [ah] it's called Sanwraps

I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever <malay>nanti dorang letak dalam satu</malay> bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower <malay>yang macam</malay> yellow colour everything then you have like <malay>macam</malay>
blue colour of flowers and I and then <malay>macam ada</malay> purple <malay>sikit</malay> and then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a <malay>macam</malay>

[oh] actually [kan] I <malay>takut</malay> [seh] <malay>nak simpan</malay> flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday

but you know [ah] I don't know if you <malay>pernah dengar</malay> there's this cafe called Antea Social
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal [lah] but then
they brew their coffee [eh] no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
and then they sell like cakes [ah] [oh] my god <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !whoa! <malay>macam sedap</malay> [jer]

[a'ah] Singapore
!huh! why you ask me that
[oh] (um)
!haiya! for me
(hmm) let me think
actually
I know that
if I cannot like <malay>macam</malay> give birth or what right
I should be open to having <malay>anak angkat</malay> [ah] cause like
like if especially if my husband wants a child
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel <malay>macam tak</malay> comfortable
ya
ya I <malay>tak</malay> comfortable I think in a way because like
I mean like you can always say [oh] I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
someone <malay>punya</malay>
that's why
[ah]
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head [ah]
<malay>kenapa</malay> would you consider
[ah]
ya
I I don't know [ah]
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
but would you <malay>nak</malay> would you <malay>simpan</malay> like cat or whatever pet
you love cats
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can [ah] <malay>pelihara</malay> like
<malay>kucing</malay> when I [dah] <malay>besar</malay> but when I think about it right
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
(mm)
I don't know [seh] it really depends [ah] whether I have time to <malay>jaga</malay> them or not
that's why
[oh] my god actually right last time I <malay>pergi rumah kawan</malay> I cause <malay>dia ada</malay> rabbit
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
and then like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang bising</malay> [tau]
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment [ah] it's like why would you keep them there [seh]
[oh] actually [ah]
I okay with zoo [seh] cause I feel <malay>yang macam</malay>
(uh) ya it's true [ah] <malay>yang dorang patut</malay> be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I mean those are just news [lah] I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also [what]
[orh]
