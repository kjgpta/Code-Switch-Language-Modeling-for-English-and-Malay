what was I going to ask [oh] but then <malay>macam</malay> was it <malay>susah</malay> to like
suddenly
you know you you took on like new cases <malay>atau</malay> existing cases that they pass on to you <malay>gitu macam tak</malay> hard to adjust
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> short staff short staff <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] no
[oh]
[oh] I think I remember your office <malay>dekat mana dia tempat</malay> (uh) my office <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>daerah situ</malay>
(mm)
(uh) <malay>apa apa itu nak cakap</malay> (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya that that's why
ya
ya [oh] so
they offered you full time is it
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh] <malay>tapi padahal</malay> they
[oh]
(mm)
ya so <malay>macam</malay> your experience is good [lah] from the [oh]
and then <malay>macam</malay> environment besides environment wise <malay>macam</malay> your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like okay like no issues
that's good that's refreshing
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>pasal dia dah biasa</malay> with what <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia dah buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's (mm) awkward
<malay>tidak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita apa itu</malay> take turns
(mm)
(mm)
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
(mm)
wait that that that's a good thing [kan] or
(mm)
(mm)
ya
are there <malay>ada</malay> interns <malay>lain</malay> or you just <malay>seorang</malay> intern like or like got other people <malay>macam</malay> doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually <malay>macam</malay> fresh grads or
all <malay>macam budak</malay> masters or like <malay>budak</malay> degree <malay>macam</malay> you know same level as you
[oh] okay
or people with experience [lah] so they don't have to train so much
independent
(mm)
I see
ya
(mm) LOL
ya
ya that's true
[oh] that's a lot
that's why #siao#
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's not <malay>macam</malay> it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
<malay>ketawa</malay> but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year <malay>atau</malay>
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
[oh] so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
[oh]
ya
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
<malay>macam</malay> organisations [lah]
you know <malay>ada</malay> this issue
so you're not gonna take take up their
<malay>apa itu</malay> offer so called
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay
ya
(mm)
it's okay keep your options open then <malay>macam</malay> explore (um) you know <malay>macam lain</malay> opportunities when do they need to hear by
(uh) okay <malay>tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam</malay> deadline for the application
[ah] okay okay
[ah]
ya <malay>faham faham</malay> totally <malay>faham</malay>
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
cause <malay>tadi bila</malay> I <malay>ketawa</malay> [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> line <malay>macam besar</malay>
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like [oh] no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
<malay>apa nak cakap</malay> (mm)
[oh] okay ya I totally understand <malay>macam</malay> the need to take a break I mean
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
(mm) make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
studying [kan] <malay>lagi berapa lama</malay> before you finish the when you finish your masters
<malay>tak</malay> necessary is it
(mm)
(mm) [ah] ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking <malay>macam</malay> you know I really don't mind
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
(mm) dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in (uh) you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
so <malay>macam</malay> who knows maybe if I if a a different place <malay>macam</malay> even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) it's been good I am teaching
okay is <malay>macam</malay> zoom is surprisingly so much harder than <malay>tak</malay> zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like <malay>macam</malay> you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot <malay>macam</malay> how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like (um) when I
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
(um) switch [lah] so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like [oh] my god
and then <malay>macam</malay> the way you talk to them actually on zoom [kan] you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so <malay>macam</malay> the tone <malay>macam</malay> they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me [lah] cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you (um) (err) I need I'll be like (err) [oh] sit down okay or like (err)
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want [lah]
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
(mm) be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then <malay>macam</malay> I get a bit sub [ah] subconscious a bit conscious <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> camera on so <malay>macam</malay> when my camera <malay>itu</malay> on so I <malay>boleh nampak</malay> my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very <malay>macam</malay> self-conscious <malay>gitu</malay> [lah]
so <malay>tapi bila</malay> I off (um) I am less self-conscious I can be less
(err) I can be more strict <malay>gitu tapi</malay> I tend to not because <malay>kita</malay> have to <malay>senyum</malay> for the entire lesson <malay>senyum</malay> for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau macam</malay> camera off then I will <malay>terlupa</malay> to <malay>senyum</malay> <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] ya so a lot of things to take note <malay>macam</malay>
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
<malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> type nonsense <malay>tau macam</malay> hi hi hi hi <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> answer <malay>dia</malay> A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like (ugh) but then okay [lah] they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] last week I did not teach because (um) [oh] so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay>
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I <malay>tak</malay> warm up [lah] it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just <malay>angkat berat</malay> then I felt like <malay>macam</malay> a sharp pain in my back then I was like [oh] no
so I thought I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay okay is it because I'm sore <malay>asal asal macam susah ini</malay> I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
you know my period's coming
[tau] like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
be <malay>sakit</malay> [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I really messed up like !aiya! something is wrong [lah] this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back <malay>tapi</malay> I continue whatever I can but <malay>lepas</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I had a class [lah] and then during the class I told them I will be <malay>lambat sikit</malay> because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour <malay>macam</malay> this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay> so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually <malay>kita</malay> will <malay>jumpa</malay> about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in [lah] so it's still okay
and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my (um) how to say my not my supervisor [lah] she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday <malay>tak payah</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
<malay>jadi</malay> on saturday she told me (uh) <malay>tak payah kerja</malay> because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pergi</malay> cause my back <malay>sakit</malay> so I was like okay [lah] okay [lah]
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came (uh) okay [lah] like out of the six of us only like four people [eh] two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
ya <malay>tapi</malay>
ya then after that I thought okay just rest [lah] <malay>macam</malay> take this opportunity to rest so I rest <malay>tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> it hurts when I sneeze so I thought !alamak! <malay>ini macam</malay> not <malay>macam bukan tak</malay> normal [kan] ya
ya so I told my coach <malay>semalam yang</malay> it hurts when I sneeze so she said (mm) she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like [oh] maybe you should go <malay>sebab kalau pergi</malay> the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like <malay>tak nak</malay> so she was like okay [lah] then <malay>macam tengok</malay> chiro or like (uh) get a sports massage [lah] so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like <malay>bekam</malay>
and sports massage cause I read like <malay>bekam</malay> can help with like nerve <malay>macam</malay> you know what if your nerve <malay>macam</malay> (err) nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you <malay>macam</malay> you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so <malay>macam</malay> it's apparently <malay>bekam</malay> can help with that and <malay>macam</malay>
ya <malay>bekam</malay> can help you with that I <malay>takut</malay> <malay>sakit tak</malay> have you tried it before
[oh] did she say if <malay>tak sakit</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(uh) yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
(mm) you free [kan] <malay>dekat</malay> #gambas# that's where my other gym is
there's
(uh) <malay>dekat</malay> #sembawang# there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that (um) has is qualified to do like the massage and the <malay>bekam</malay> is <malay>dekat</malay> will be at the #gambas# one on monday
(err) she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she <malay>belum</malay> reply I so I <malay>tak tahu belum</malay> confirm [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm hoping that !aiya! I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
<malay>itu pasal</malay> she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so <malay>macam</malay>
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then <malay>macam</malay> what she will do depends on your condition so <malay>macam</malay> either I mean you can ask for her to <malay>bekam</malay> [lah] if you that's what you want <malay>macam mana</malay> otherwise she will (uh) base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a <malay>bekam</malay> or like some mobility work [ah]
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> I think she <malay>buat bekam angin</malay> if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing <malay>bekam</malay> on instagram can send you
no it looks like the <malay>angin</malay> one like <malay>ada macam</malay> after she put the cup like she pull something (mm) then the thing <malay>macam</malay> suction
go for the <malay>darah</malay> one
(mm)
[oh] so the <malay>dia macam</malay> slightly different how to say
(err) like <malay>bekam angin</malay> versus <malay>bekam darah macam</malay> target slightly different things [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] okay
[oh]
I see okay good that I
don't then
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>dekat rumah dia</malay> is it
[oh] then hers is how much
[oh] I <malay>ada macam</malay> hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
(mm)
(mm)
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby [kan]
(um) like consultation <malay>dia sahaja dah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> ya she she's a private doctor [lah] so very <malay>mahal</malay> like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation <malay>sahaja</malay> hundred plus then <malay>macam</malay> if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage <malay>atau bekam dulu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>kalau</malay> it's not like
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
no [ah] <malay>abeh sekarang sekarang</malay> my <malay>kaki sakit dah</malay> [lah] <malay>belakang sakit kaki sakit</malay> because I <malay>pergi</malay> gym
for training yesterday [kan] then (uh) certain things #aqilah# [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> you know she
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know <malay>macam</malay> I feel like my ego I have like <malay>macam</malay> like it's frustrating [lah]
like all the progress I've made gone so <malay>macam</malay> the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because <malay>macam nak angkat sahaja sakit</malay> then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared [lah] so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya so she also like told me to just
ya and then <malay>tapi semalam ada sekarang</malay> my <malay>kaki sakit</malay> because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so <malay>macam</malay> like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so <malay>macam</malay>
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
[oh] really [ah] tuesday I still have like (um) today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more <malay>sakit</malay> then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after <malay>bekam</malay> there's no like rule to not do any physical activity [kan] I mean <malay>kita jalan sahaja</malay>
so <malay>kalau kita</malay> I mean <malay>kita</malay> hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
[oh] my god my laughter is so cringe <malay>nanti orang</malay> transcribe
(mm)
[oh] that is so
[oh] my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
<malay>macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti</malay> all the haha hehes that <malay>kena</malay> transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also [lah] can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
you know
it's just like (ugh) gross
way lower than you thought
[oh]
(mm) and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high (mm)
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something (uh)
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think #inhan# sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
[oh] mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me [lah] I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
(mm)
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that [lah] it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not [kan] so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans [oh] chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
(err) ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just (ugh) celebrity
I guess
is it (mm) I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
[oh] anyway <malay>apa itu</malay> so
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
have you seen the list (uh) list <malay>pula</malay> have you seen the website <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>hantar</malay>
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
I don't know [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the jinx <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
I mean <malay>mana-mana pun ada</malay> so it's me [lah]
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say <malay>dekat situ ada banyak</malay> trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
(mm)
your areas <malay>ada ke</malay> other trails macritchie is it wait no #sembawang# area
[oh]
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it <malay>apa nak cakap</malay> [eh] okay we can look at more sites [lah] think got more options <malay>tapi yang yang</malay> at the the one I sent you to (mm) <malay>kita ada</malay> the lower pierce reservoir park
(mm) #ang mo kio# park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
and then there's the #sungei buloh# wetland reserve need <malay>ini dekat mana</malay> [eh] #kranji# hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
(mm) ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
[oh] this one got stairs don't want <malay>malas</malay> they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
and this one quite
[oh] eco green
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know #afiqah# #afiqah# you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time <malay>ingat tak yang kita pergi makan</malay>
[eh] were you staying at our table
<malay>yang kita makan</malay> #mukshidonna# [oh] ya so she was talking about that
(mm)
she got married (uh) I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite (um) because like (err)
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
(um) they only allow like ten people
(mm) and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it [lah] like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
(mm) I don't think so
[oh] is the is the one that her long term the one that always [eh] ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
(mm)
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
(mm)
not officially <malay>tapi</malay> like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice [lah] he just seems <malay>macam</malay> very shy a bit <malay>macam</malay> shy [lah] I mean like a group of girls then <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>kecoh</malay> so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
ya and very <malay>macam</malay> considering he's quite young he's very <malay>macam</malay> independentish <malay>macam</malay> financially independent like ya like matured [lah] matured
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
(um)
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
because (err) I assume her house I mean her house is big [kan] so I think and her room is big so I think <malay>macam</malay> he moved in with her [lah]
(mm) makes more sense
and <malay>padahal</malay> and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house <malay>tapi macam</malay> is easier <malay>pakai tudung leceh</malay> you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay [lah] I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing <malay>tudung</malay>
[oh]
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because <malay>macam</malay> how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes [lah] like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then <malay>macam</malay> if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi macam</malay> less of an issue <malay>kalau</malay> if the guy moves into the house cause he
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working [ah] then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
(mm)
[oh] like the dad is more chill [lah] usually
(uh) ya that's true I feel like <malay>macam</malay> there's that expectation [lah] double standards a bit ya
and also like it's a culture thing also [lah] like [oh] you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
not working ya because like [oh] <malay>perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja</malay> you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
