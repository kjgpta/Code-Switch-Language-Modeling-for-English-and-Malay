(uh) they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to [lah] to to study <malay>abeh sekarang</malay> border closed right and also the cases rising [kan]
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus <malay>kat</malay> #dubai#
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I don't know if it's true or not <malay>macam</malay> the students will go there
ya
that's why <malay>macam tak</malay>
that's why <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tak dengar</malay> at all right about #dubai# like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student [ah] cause anyway if in in any cases <malay>macam</malay> both <malay>tak buka</malay> or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
ya
(uh) and then
also
speaking of new zealand
I remember that <malay>aku teringat</malay> there's this (um) guy in my primary school <malay>macam</malay> he he's from new zealand [ah]
ya he's from new zealand
ya <malay>tapi dia</malay> mix <malay>macam cina</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cina dengan</malay>
okay but I didn't really talk to him so I
ya my primary school okay [lah] more not a friend [lah] more of a classmate
so last time <malay>aku ada</malay> this whatsapp group
(uh) ya whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great [lah] and I like my grammar <malay>macam</malay> like
(uh) <malay>sembarang</malay> right ya then after that
(uh) he was inside that group also and I never talk to him at all so
I type something I think I type like <malay>macam</malay>
this was like in like primary five I think ya
ya
ya okay anyway
anyway
he [oh] sorry I typed if I'm not wrong [lah] maybe something like she have [kan] <malay>salah</malay> right ya
and then he corrected me [seh]
ya he corrected me and then he's like [oh] your english sucks
ya then I <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time I was like rude
ya ya and then I left the group
ya I left the group cause
<malay>macam</malay>
because of him [lah] to be honest and that was like rude [what] like I know [lah] like my english sucks at that time of point but you don't say that to a person
I don't know I I don't care
I have no idea I literally have no idea
(ugh) that's not the point
[ah] just just so rude but anyway
that incident made me want
ya made me want to brush my english ya
look at me now
ya

serious
okay [lah] I think that time also <malay>aku dua minit abeh aku</malay> hit curb <malay>abeh dia</malay> like <malay>terus suruh balik</malay>
me too
serious
but like before the test she look she looked confident to be honest ya
(uh) like she sounded confident [lah] ya right
[eh]
ya mine also mine was smooth also <malay>macam</malay>
I think it's just the nerves [ah]
!huh! serious why
but she book already
then she should book
ya or not confirm like <malay>lambat gila</malay>
you already have motor just take the motor [lah]
okay [lah] actually no it's good

but it's okay I mean at least her instructor nice [kan]
ya and the <malay>pakcik</malay>
her own instructor

it's outdoor activity <malay>macam</malay> outdoor outdoor learning ya
sort of but she but she applied for to teach
<malay>belum</malay> she just went for the english test
I don't know like after this english test then she will
but I think the english test should be final <malay>macam</malay> like the final round I guess ya then she will know [lah] ya
teaching [ah]
this is diploma in teaching
ya diploma so she can only teach in primary school if I'm not wrong
ya then <malay>kalau</malay> she <malay>nak ajar kat</malay> secondary then <malay>kena ambil</malay> degree [ah] ya
obviously but speaking of that
I suddenly <malay>macam nak</malay> apply for
at first <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> my ambition [eh] <malay>dengar</malay> my ambition like when I was younger was to teach <malay>macam</malay> like ya like I always know [oh] maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout (mm) secondary school poly <malay>macam</malay> okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why <malay>macam</malay> I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
ya I don't know how about you
industry
[oh]
[oh] so when what do you mean by food what manufacturing [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like what you do
like do you get

okay
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay>
chemistry
[oh]
I get it then so what could be your potential future careers with that degree
what would it be
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
<malay>macam</malay> niche [lah] right ya <malay>baik</malay> [ah]
I see but so interesting
[oh] anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right <malay>macam</malay>
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know <malay>macam ambil duit abeh balik</malay> ya
ya
[oh] serious why
(uh huh)
[oh]
ya
(uh huh)
as in nursing <malay>belajar</malay> nursing
[oh] but why I thought she just got a full time job
I no no I don't understand I don't see the point
but it's just what she's suddenly passionate I mean like not passionate but interested or
but to be honest <malay>macam</malay> just take one thing at a time [ah]
ya I mean and she <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay>
<malay>abeh nak</malay>
exactly
exactly <malay>abeh nak ambil</malay> nursing
options
okay that's true
ya ya
stick to one
okay [lah] hopefully
<malay>doakan</malay>
ya
but to be honest my degree also I'm also not so sure if I want ya
if I want to
ya stay or like continue finishing
but it's tough [lah] I mean it's ya it's <malay>banyak nak kena fikir</malay>
!huh!
no as in <malay>aku tahu</malay> [ah]
not in the in that regard but <malay>macam</malay>
don't know <malay>kalau</malay> don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
ya
so did you apply for the for the <malay>madrasah</malay> course
why
!alah! this is why
<malay>ilmu ilmu apa</malay> [eh] <malay>pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
and <malay>kebanyakan macam orang</malay>
!duh! but <malay>orang muda</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> our age [ah]
it's not a <malay>syarahan</malay> it's really <malay>macam kau belajar buku</malay> like all the <malay>buku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam ada banyak banyak buku</malay>
<malay>kitab</malay> sure like okay sure ya
but interesting [lah] ya <malay>macam</malay> some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
<malay>macam</malay> sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting [ah] and the <malay>ustad</malay> funny
ya
<malay>macam</malay> he's like the <malay>abang-abang</malay> type <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>buat kelakar</malay> [ah] like every single every single lesson
ya
not we are not <malay>rapat</malay> [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
as in like it's not like we talk everyday <malay>ke apa</malay>
[ah] ya like ya we are just no but serious <malay>macam</malay> in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other [lah] ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can
ya ya all through zoom
but quite sad [lah] like I want to go back
I mean even uni also is through zoom
and I don't to be honest I don't quite like it
because <malay>macam</malay> not that productive
ya
serious
[oh]
are you serious
[oh] <malay>abeh</malay>
ya I don't even attend
because okay
cause
it's recorded ya so <malay>macam</malay> what's the point
if you wanna sit in <malay>abeh</malay> some of the students <malay>tanya banyak soalan</malay> and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching (uh) one of the videos [kan] as it <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> for like like twenty minutes non stop
ya and then I just skip that part I was like
<malay>abeh</malay> lecturer <malay>dia boleh layan</malay> and he's a he's an old man [lah] so of course [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>dia macam</malay> like
<malay>ambil hati</malay> and he would he will also <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>jawab</malay> [lah] all of <malay>apa dia punya</malay> questions
exactly she's ya
[eh]
ya so ya it's damn unproductive [lah] but then again <malay>macam</malay> if go back on campus lessons only like <malay>tiga jam</malay>
<malay>abeh pergi balik</malay>
I don't know
but I think I think physical better [ah]
ya
but <malay>malas</malay> ya and <malay>jauh jauh</malay> [seh] <malay>tempat dia</malay>
<malay>aku naik apa</malay>
but I tried going to campus before <malay>aku naik</malay> train
ya <malay>abeh kena</malay> stop [ah] <malay>dekat</malay>
(mm)
<malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] no
[eh] (uh)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>lupa</malay>
<malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> but that time once I went there <malay>aku</malay> stop <malay>dekat</malay> I think #bugis#
(err) <malay>tak</malay> I stop at #bugis# <malay>abeh tukar</malay>
ya !duh! <malay>takkan</malay> I stop at #bugis# [sia] <malay>abeh kena naik</malay> bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like <malay>kalau</malay> my <malay>apa</malay> my <malay>kakak dapat</malay> then my dad will <malay>belikan kereta</malay>
both of us [ah]
just change [ah] <malay>macam siapa siapa</malay> like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no [lah] for what
dorm ya
no [lah] for what <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
ya but
I know but I don't think
ya
but I don't think she wants to stay at the dorm I think for us to be honest not worth it and if we have a car for what you want to stay at the dorm ya
ya <malay>fikir</malay> [ah]
ya so it makes sense [what] right ya
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>macam mana kau pergi sekolah</malay>
[oh] [oh] ya
but <malay>jauh naik</malay> public bus
where's your school [eh] like which like because I know

I mean okay [lah] like there's no COVID cases but don't take the risk [ah] ya
ya
(mm)
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin <malay>macam</malay> they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think <malay>belum lagi</malay> phase two then they remove
<malay>macam</malay> just because like [oh] decrease <malay>ye ye o</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh tak ye ye o</malay> [seh]
