actually <malay>ada ada</malay> iphone eight plus <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan]
[oh]

<malay>ambil</malay> iphone ten [ah] <malay>pelik</malay> [ah]
no what are they doing
<malay>dekat rumah</malay>
ya
[oh] (uh) today <malay>pergi sekolah apa</malay>
<malay>bapak</malay>
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
[oh]
[oh] so how many [ah] <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah] one week one week <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah]
[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
[ah] interview maybe <malay>yang</malay> second time [ah] second time <malay>dia orang suruh ambil</malay> this kind
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
no I mean (uh) <malay>bukan yang bukan</malay> [tau] the the one at (uh) what you call that
the the you must type the code inside
that one you that one <malay>tak boleh</malay> search <malay>apa</malay> online
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
(um) <malay>tak</malay>
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] I think they really keep calling you know
yesterday there's <malay>ada satu</malay> interview [eh] recruiter [kan]
it's like
what's the word [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very pushy [ah] so like
like you know like you ask them to call back [kan] <malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] no only two minutes <malay>macam</malay> a bit annoying [ah] you know
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
<malay>orang melayu cakap</malay> (um) <malay>jangan apa</malay>
[ah] I forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
most of the job <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> !aiya! it's like contract it's not really [ah]
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
that is that makes sense [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> nobody will also <malay>macam</malay>
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
full time but because <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] I teach tuition [kan]
so tuition
but ya that's why
no but tuition only left <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay> [ah] until (um) october [kan] O level <malay>atau</malay> N level [kan]
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
last week I just start (um) this new student [ah] <malay>budak melayu</malay> [ah] <malay>budak apa</malay> N level [ah] N level <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit batok#
I think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference I think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
no I think now they they make more centres [ah] I think they I think <malay>dia orang</malay> there's no way they can do in a big hall [what] [kan]
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
then <malay>yang</malay> students <malay>yang lain</malay> all <malay>pergi</malay> normal classroom [ah]
I think same time [ah] the the whole singapore <malay>mesti</malay> same time [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> later how to know that you know
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
I think part time got got a a lot job [ah] <malay>macam yang</malay> this (um)
<malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] (um)
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) I think
about five to ten [ah] or four to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
for part time <malay>mesti</malay> commit
(um) for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer [ah] so
for me best is (um) data analsyt <malay>atau</malay> business analyst
<malay>atau</malay> system analyst [ah]
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
<malay>kena</malay> twenty four seven support
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
it's like like to me not much difference right <malay>kalau</malay> work from home then
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
I think python <malay>macam</malay> python for me is okay [lah] because it's a
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
actually high level is the the code that <malay>macam</malay> can be readable [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay> if a human being <malay>baca</malay> the code
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
[ah] there's this code thing called fortran right <malay>betul tak</malay>
it's called [ah] fortran
A N ya
then what <malay>ni apa</malay> this there's this language <malay>namanya</malay> C hash [eh] <malay>apa</malay> C hash [eh] is it
is it C hash or something hash
[ah] C sharp
!huh! golac
G G O L A C [eh]
[oh] golang
but it's (um) the pace is what like <malay>dia ikut</malay> which (um) which language
(mm)
okay then
because
I don't really like to like build you know <malay>macam</malay> build all the app
building [kan]
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time I work in a bank [kan]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> (um) during the year twenty
twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
[kan]
that time I work in a bank [kan] so
my job mostly like [ah] then investigate [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
L O G S [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
[ah] error error <malay>dia akan</malay> email [kan] so times ten [kan] times ten
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay> need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
like enriching to do this kind of work but <malay>yang tak suka</malay> is the I really <malay>benci</malay> is support twenty four seven on the phone [ah]
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] I think there's only one period that
the like not say down time [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead [what] only [lah] then just wake up [what] that time
because there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right [ah]
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
I don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
<malay>nenek boleh pergi balik</malay> [ah] <malay>nenek</malay>
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
(um) I think <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] but [eh] but <malay>dia</malay> right <malay>yang syakilah iman</malay> is maybe [ah] I think
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
[eh] I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think <malay>berlambak</malay> [ah] mail <malay>dia</malay>
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
no [ah] [oh] auntie I always just say <malay>cik cik rozi</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something [ah]
cousins (uh)
they I think busy also [ah]
then <malay>dah</malay> you all <malay>dah makan belum</malay>
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
<malay>semua tengah tidur</malay> [kan]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
<malay>tak dia punya</malay> ingredients [kan] <malay>beli kat pasar atau</malay> (uh)
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
you mean the <malay>ikan</malay> is the the one that is boneless [eh]
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
(um) <malay>mesti</malay>
fry the [eh] fry the fish first right
ya the sauce right then pour on top [kan] just just <malay>tuang</malay>
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make [ah] <malay>macam</malay> mix and match
<malay>apa apa</malay> ya like
tomato <malay>semua</malay> [ah] tomato (um) pineapple
[ah] capsicum <malay>sedap</malay> I like I like the capsicum
I think the it [ah] the the the preparation is a
the <malay>yang makan masa</malay> [ah] [kan]
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
for for us actually if let's say our our family [kan] <malay>macam nak ada</malay> maid [kan]
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
<malay>kalau siapa dah kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>atau</malay> like we have our own house [kan] maybe separate [ah] let's say I
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
no I mean like one maid [ah] because like the maid <malay>tak payah</malay> just stay at one house do all the work [what] because sometimes <malay>mak ada nenek ada</malay> [kan] so maybe can
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but I think
internally [kan] if
the maid is okay then we we must <malay>bayar</malay> for the transport
and maybe give them time off [ah] [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
<malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>atau tak</malay>
feel <malay>macam</malay> pressure [kan] we we like they call it give and take [ah]
don't over over work the maid [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> maid is okay then okay [what] you know
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
this one maybe we can plan ten [ah] next time because <malay>bapak</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua<malay> [kan] <malay>nanti mak</malay>
like at least like the maid <malay>boleh masakkan</malay> actually the best [kan] the maid <malay>masak</malay>
right because if the maid <malay>masak</malay> right then we just need to buy the stuff [ah] then <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh</malay> just order online [kan]
but any online <malay>pasar</malay> or not <malay>macam pasar</malay> food [eh] buy meat or chicken <malay>ada</malay> [eh]
but I mean like the <malay>betul punya pasar</malay> online maybe maybe
no because fairprice <malay>jual</malay> beef <malay>tak</malay> [eh] because beef is very hard to find right
but I think they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
(um) <malay>macam mana</malay> the person <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
[oh] no [oh] but means the device [kan] then the the user <malay>mesti jalan</malay> to
so call move [ah]
I think no but
I think I think [ah] Singapore difficult because you know why or not
our our house all small [what] america everything is so big [kan] I mean america everything you see <malay>dia punya rumah besar-besar</malay> or I think european some also the house big [kan]
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
but the device is (uh) quite <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] I think thousands right
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
so seven days <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> [ah] just somewhere else [ah]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] during the COVID
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] I don't know [ah]
<malay>itu hari cakap</malay> open the ikea but [oh] but now open [lah]
half [ah]
I think half of that
[eh] I think because I think
susah nak apa kita</malay>
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot [ah] like last time I went I went exchange also same [ah] I I
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so nobody can meet their friends to eat [what] so they just have to eat <malay>cepat-cepat makan</malay> then then just <malay>balik</malay> class [ah]
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
but that that time weird you know [ah] <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa nama kedai dia yang</malay> mister you you know orchid house <malay>dekat</malay> #serangoon# gardens <malay>tu</malay>
orchid house the the indian food <malay>macam mamak</malay> [ah]
<malay>mamak</malay> food
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
<malay>al-azhar gitu</malay> those kind <malay>macam</malay> woodgrove <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
phase the first week of phase two [kan] <malay>atau</malay> I think I <malay>jumpa</malay> my friend during the phase two second week [ah] [kan]
phase two is about nineteen june [kan] so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend <malay>makan dekat tu</malay> [ah] orchid house
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
<malay>pelik ke</malay> so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird [ah] [kan]
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
I mean they can do that [lah] but I think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
<malay>mesti</malay> customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else [kan] because
because of the <malay>apa</malay> seating arrangement
or if they more than five
and some people they <malay>apa</malay> like they in a group [kan] say eight people [ah] four four [kan]
so I think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like I think they
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then <malay>bersembang</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan-kawan</malay> [kan]
but I think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like very strict [ah] I mean [eh] it's it's not the [kan]
(uh) [eh] it's so they are very strict [ah]
so
I think some of the
(um) I heard the store owner [kan] <malay>atau</malay> business owner dia orang</malay> call the
[kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] I don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
but sometimes we think [oh] it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you <malay>tengok</malay> news
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya I think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
[eh] but do do you think it's possible [kan] <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> make a system [kan] means by far away then they auto checkout
[ah] if the person off then <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya the the app <malay>apa</malay> what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
it's good [kan] <malay>macam</malay> but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google [ah] [kan]
I don't know [ah] because like maybe I want to try Google [ah] but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
actually that one <malay>bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal</malay> you like [eh] !hey! google then the you can play spotify
you can play (um) I mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] I realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] I mean the I mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
K because my my friend he <malay>dia pakai</malay> google home [eh] google phone [tau] so I use apple [ah] but the that time I stay #punggol# also share with him [kan]
so
I ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause I think like google gmail [ah] all this something
