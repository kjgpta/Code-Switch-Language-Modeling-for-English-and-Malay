(um)
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
no you close your eyes

okay I would get like
a good body for certain reasons
if you
were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
<malay>sekiranya anda perlu memakan hanya satu hidangan buat selama-lamanya</malay>
<malay>makanan apakah yang akan anda pilih</malay>
[oh] period
why you copy me
<malay>ayam lemak</malay>
I won't get it I will just stick to #mala#
because #mala# the <malay>rempah dia sama tapi</malay> like the ingredients you can switch it up you know what I mean
so everyday you're eating like different
ingredients but still the same base
I like I like I want to try mexican food though
like authentic ones
my friends in school like now school
like I've been talking to
like some of them like
having daily conversations with them on Whatsapp
like <malay>macam</malay> this guy
his <malay>dia melayu dia</malay>
<malay>nama dia</malay> #zul#
he's twenty four this year so basically like he went to the he like he went he went to the route [lah]
so his life is basically like just moving around you know like
he lived in (um) #abu dhabi# then he came back in singapore he lived like multiple
houses in like through singapore like from the west to the east to the north
ya
then now
you know his his life is just so interesting because he
he does a lot of things and he was from then he keep he keeps telling us about like his stories
ya I told you before like he's the he's pretty short for a guy then after that like
a lot of the people in the like they always look down on him [ah] not look down [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
tease him
<malay>macam cakap</malay> !ee! <malay>ketot</malay> then after that he cried you know [oh] my god
ya and no the thing is that he was telling us the whole story then like you know guys being guys
they'll be like [eh] <malay>kenapa kau kau nangis aku tak faham gitu</malay>
like
but for him I feel like
he's more of a emotional kind of like softy [ah] I would say
ya he's a nice guy
then (um) I
(mm)
that [one] #zul# then I have like this study group
(um) there's
there's a total of six of us four four guys then two girls
like me and the cheryl girl [lah] then the the guys
one is one is a mix of japanese indian
but he knows how you talk in malay like
damn good damn fluent
then I ask him at first like [eh] you sure you not malay [ah] cause he looks like malay also
like from from my first impression then he say no
I I chinese indian japanese I
like
he's so ya but
sad [lah] because the the parents divorce so like he didn't really get to
mingle
what
green
what happened to it
thank you I want Nalgene please
ya because that that bottle
that bottle is basically a Nalgene
no I don't care it's only ten dollars
!aww!
so who's water bottle are you going to borrow now
exactly that was your water bottle
what happened to the pink Nalgene [ah] it's missing also
ya the hot pink was mine
(mm)
[oh] then one of my guy friends like
he very funny [ah] but like suddenly he
he said guys I'm tired of this
(err) life he he was talking to us like face to face [ah] like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say !wah! I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
[oh] my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like !wah! I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay [lah] he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with [lah]
but
I say <malay>tapi kau rugi</malay> because
his whole tuition fee has been sponsored by MENDAKI <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>kirakan</malay> it's like free education and you could just going to like
let it go just like that
so wasted [lah]
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts right now
in so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules (um) module grades are based on how they perform [lah]
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
then <malay>dia orang punya</malay> written test also like he say is not that hard
whose that
#waalaikumusalam#
<malay>kejap</malay>
#sasun# you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
<malay>sampai</malay> I don't know because I took a nap from five
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that [what]
[oh] it's not a stereotype [ah] it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial [oh] my god you know
[oh] my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments [ah] basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just [oh] my god
like because (err) one of my group member
like he action do
like <malay>macam</malay> he thinks that he knows how to code
but in reality he doesn't know [lah] but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else [lah] to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring [ah] like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement [what]
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
[oh] my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing (uh) the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya
that's part of engineering
to what colour
no at this point my hair is dying
no I just don't want to
like you know now is already dry
don't you feel like when you're when you're
when your hair is coloured like it's very fragile
dye your hair no you liar
so there was something [lah]
do you regret
if I were to dye my hair
I'd dye
I want green man
there's just something about green
depends on what shades though
[oh] that bright one [ah] I prefer the
very is dark
but it's on a lighter shade
(hmm)
poor man
ya very often
<malay>tapi</malay> now
I mean we don't really like celebrate it celebrate it
it's not that special of an occasion
what's that
mother dough
what do they sell croissants
is it like is it better than that #tiong bahru# bakery
how much
for one
pastry
(mm)
is it like the japanese <malay>punya</malay> types of you know those big sandwiches
[oh] my god that looks so good
(oo) I love sourdough bread
[oh] I love that kind of pizza
handmade

tigers
well at least they're feeding them you know what I mean
but do you like to go to the zoo
my my boyfriend hates it hates it he he doesn't like it

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
from their homes
old folks home
[oh] that's cute
but so (err) (um)
I think you guys should've like incorporated those old school <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>lagu</malay> like (um) #lagus# that they reminisce to instead of like now
<malay>punya</malay> trends
that's what I feel
but like all of them chinese is it
or is it a mix
you could have asked your chinese friends
okay what what what do you want the outcome to be just them doing TikTok and enjoy
but are foods provided
[oh] I get it I
think christmas [eh]
think it's pretty hard [eh] considering there's like no physical interaction
I mean it'll be it'll be more meaningful if there's physical interaction
!aww!
second
as his pet
that's so cute
why why why why why the sudden interest
so
what happened to the fish
<malay>dia mesti tak jaga betul-betul</malay> is it

of what [oh] my god
you want to hear a ghost story of my (um) friend is

(um)
he's the type to not believe in all of these are like ghosts
spirits #pontianaks# all of that [ah]
until one night
like he experienced this this
this situation of like he thinks it's a <malay>pontianak</malay>
he thinks [ah]
so basically right
he and this other (um) guy his friend chinese guy
they were on guard duty
and they need to make some rounds [lah] around the ammunition <malay>punya</malay> dump area
so they patrol patrol they have to patrol around it
like but they behind that ammunition dump there is this
<malay>tempat</malay> that is very <malay>keras</malay> you know
<malay>abah</malay> keep quiet I'm recording

it's a forested area and it's damn dark there wasn't any light or lamp post
so dark but they still had to go there and make like some rounds [lah] whether there's like anyone there
so this guy the chinese guy <malay>dia macam</malay> action [tau] <malay>dia macam</malay> like okay [lah]
(err) I don't believe all of this [lah] nonsense [eh] want to follow me or not like
see what's what's inside
like the forested area [lah] <malay>dekat belakang</malay> the ammunition dump
then my friend he's an indian guy he's like what the heck don't want [lah] for what then after that
the chinese guy keeps keeps on like he was being persistent [lah] like [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] let's go let's go plus I playing like some songs so you don't need to hear anything
so he he started to play his (um) chinese songs [lah] while they were like
(um) exploring the area but luckily they didn't go like very deep inside
until like (um)
my friend told him to like
off the off the song [ah] because it's like at night [what]
then he say okay [lah] I off the sound (um) the song then after that when he off right
both of them they suddenly hear this (um) this very nice lady was singing
like singing malay song [a'ah] like
he said [oh] my god like that
song has been the back of my mind until now like I can still remember it he said I I wasn't joking
like someone (err) I don't know [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> like you know (err) how
#pontianaks# in in movies like before they appear <malay>dia orang nyanyi macam</malay> (mm)
he he is damn nice but like it's a lady's voice and it's a forested area
like no one is there who will be there in the middle of the night it's already twelve [ah] that time twelve to one
and suddenly the trees above them start to shake you know
but they didn't say they didn't see anything
then my friend basically said bro I I I don't care about you if if you want to die here you
just you just stay here I'm just going to run back then he went back then the guy behind him
that that chinese guy follow behind him
ya run also back
then after that my my guy I mean my

ya then <malay>dia orang pun bodoh dia orang pun bodoh</malay> still want to go there not <malay>dia orang</malay> [ah] like
the chinese okay my friend also
but he said [oh] my god I can hear someone like a lady literally singing
