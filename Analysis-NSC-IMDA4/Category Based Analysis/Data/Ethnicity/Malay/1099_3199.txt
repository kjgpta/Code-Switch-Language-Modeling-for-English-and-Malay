unusual superpower
(err)
(hmm) I think one of the most obvious ones would be the ability to grow money to grow money because I think (err) if I have all the money in the world I can actually help lots of people ya deep [eh]
which is what you want <malay>teleport</malay>
it is nice ya
teleport
(err) actually I I I said that because like (err) my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's #hyorin# [lor] #hyorin# the #sistar# [one]
so and I think is a very good (err) superpower superpower cause I think right now (um) you know with money we can actually do lots of stuff
answer politically right answer
I actually saw this (err) one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
so the is like a sci-fi movie where (err) the story is about this (err) boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so (err) it happened (err) <malay>sebab</malay> one day <malay>dia macam apa tu</malay> he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so <malay>dia punya</malay> classmates I mean when the group <malay>macam ada</malay>
gangster gangster <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] ya so like even though they are very young the (err) they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time (uh) <malay>macam dia tengah lari tengah lari</malay> from the <malay>orang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> (um) one of them from the bad guy actually <malay>tembak</malay>
<malay>tembak</malay> the the guy so he hit the side of his head [ah] ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone (err) in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid [lah] but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
(err) to actually (um) see whatever you're typing (err) whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related [lah] and he has the ability to <malay>macam</malay> technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like (err) if you think about it right <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool [lah] very cool
ya <malay>cuma macam</malay> now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others (uh) for others for his own good and to help others [lah] I mean <malay>macam</malay> so he helped to track down the the culprits [ah] so the story was (err) <malay>macam apa tu</malay> (uh) this (uh) the neighbourhood is <malay>macam ada apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> is run by this (err) drug drug society drug a group [ah] like (err) ya so he helped to track this group down <malay>abeh macam</malay> help the police to do so he he use his technology <malay>macam</malay> to draw them in [lah] to expose on the drugs and dark secrets <malay>dorang ada</malay> to the neighbourhood and to the police
ya so it's it's inspiring [lah] I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school (err) high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
[orh] no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts <malay>macam</malay> like (err) ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like (err) put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool [lah] ya
ya <malay>ke</malay> [oh] is it that's nice [oh] he more like he targets the the gangsters society but <malay>dia macam</malay> he let them (uh) like he drains all of their bank accounts so that <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> resources
like to turn to [lah] in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
[orh] (err) usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience (err) any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that <malay>macam</malay>
there's always like (err) well known stereotypes (err) within the malay community (err) for example <malay>macam</malay> one very good example would be <malay>macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai</malay> in math <malay>gitu</malay> ya from young so and usually like (err) because like <malay>orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat</malay> void deck <malay>gitu</malay> so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people [lor] in a sense ya
which I think (err) <malay>palsu</malay> [lah] because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it [what] it's the same for everyone <malay>cuma dulu</malay> is okay [what] to <malay>lepak</malay> cause like last time with your friends just chill chill [lah] like if if you like to me if your if your kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is <malay>main</malay> (err) like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is really like is at the void deck [lah] chit chat <malay>yang main</malay> guitar ya so is the same kind of <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] I mean is just different kind of how you view <malay>lepak</malay> as
I think (err) I think it's is somewhat true [lah] because I think it is somewhat true because like (uh) if you were talking about right there's (um) the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like (err) there's not a lot of us (err) compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
even though I do agree that (err) there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but (err) to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to (err) <malay>macam</malay> public uni [ah] I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases <malay>macam</malay> after poly right they they (err) they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then <malay>macam</malay> if you look at (err) maritime studies [kan] (err) from poly (err) I think I got one friend <malay>yang macam</malay> he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship [one]
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think (err) that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he (um) he is he intends to go uni [ah] because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose [lah] I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [lah]
<malay>lama</malay> [eh] it's very long
it will be a very rewarding experience
<malay>macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam</malay> [eh]
education [ah]
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools <malay>tapi</malay> when you talk about those non like (err) like we have certain schools in singapore <malay>yang macam</malay> the fees very expensive [kan] so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not (err) for those families <malay>yang macam tak boleh</malay> afford [lah] because the fees are very expensive even like (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity (uh) to have to access (err) to access (uh) all these various (uh) resources I think it will be nice [lah] for everyone ya not saying that (err) the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools [lah] I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
[ah] education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families <malay>yang macam</malay> or those like (err) families <malay>yang macam</malay> <malay>rumah tangga ada masalah</malay> (uh) <malay>mak bapa tak boleh beri</malay> (uh) <malay>tak boleh kasi apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu anak-anak mereka</malay> so I think this is where it will be nice [lah] if the (err) those families (uh) those kids (um) can
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do [lah]
(mm)
ya
you do [lah] but some people just need (err) (err) a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit (uh) of like resources a bit then they will start to see [orh] this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school [lah] so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards (uh) <malay>macam</malay> striving to to get a scholarship
in their head ya
equality versus
equality [ah]
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
[oh] if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
(err)
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire
vampire werewolf okay okay if you if you (err) if you if you get to choose right will you be vampire or werewolf
but you have to eat other people for meals <malay>dahsyat</malay> [seh]
(um)
okay actually I want to be vampire also you know why cause less hair
<malay>tak berbulu berbulu-bulu berbulu</malay>
she is one in like ten
of course you can you can change him from a human to a werewolf
