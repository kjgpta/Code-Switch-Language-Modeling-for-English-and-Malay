(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>betul ke</malay> and you <malay>tak pernah</malay> visit
you should you should so then <malay>macam mana dengan</malay>
(mm) okay so because [kan] you are the type of
person that <malay>suka</malay> holiday <malay>suka keluar</malay> (err)
for new adventure <malay>tengok</malay> new adventure see new things so during
(err) <malay>tahun ni</malay> [kan] <malay>semasa</malay> lockdown (uh) <malay>semasa</malay> COVID you <malay>ada rasa macam</malay> you
you suffocating a bit <malay>ke tak</malay> like you know (um) like you cannot go on holiday you <malay>ada rasa macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room <malay>dengan ni</malay> house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so <malay>tak rasa macam</malay> lonely <malay>sangat</malay> [lah]
because <malay>sebelum ni</malay> [kan]
you <malay>memang tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>memasak langsung</malay> so I didn't know how to cook (um) <malay>nasi pun tak tahu</malay> [lor] so then it's like
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [lah]
then I had to <malay>macam</malay> ask
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook [lah] so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things [lah] so I felt like
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I <malay>tinggal dengan mereka</malay> [lah] at that time [ah]
<malay>boleh boleh makan</malay> [lah] but then there was this one time <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>masak</malay> (uh) <malay>kari ikan</malay>
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon [lah] then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
(uh)
salmon salmon I okay <malay>boleh makan tapi</malay> curry <malay>dia</malay> I think <malay>sebab</malay> I added too much water
so <malay>rasa dia macam air</malay> instead of or is <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> salmon soup instead of salmon curry [lah]
so it was a bit weird [lah] ya
I know right [oh] my gosh ya
!hais! you <malay>tahu tak hari tu</malay> because I'm thinking to myself
that you <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>memang</malay> drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking <malay>hari tu</malay> [kan] you know outside <malay>rumah</malay> I <malay>ni</malay> I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
enjoying my sleep [lah]
then after that [leh]
the car outside [kan]
<malay>dia</malay> accident
<malay>betapa kuatnya</malay> I heard bang
and I was like <malay>apa jadi</malay> [ah]
the but then I try to look out the window [lah] I wanted to #kaypoh# [lor]
look out the window but then <malay>tak nampak apa apa</malay> then <malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>ternampak</malay>
<malay>memang yang</malay> accident <malay>tu teruk</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan motosikal</malay>
then <malay>kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai</malay> the whole thing is spoilt [lah]
<malay>kemek</malay> already crash already [lah]
and (uh)
ya so then after that few minutes later you can <malay>terdengar</malay> [lah] ambulance <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so ya like that [lor]
so that's what happened
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tapi</malay> you <malay>pernah kena</malay> accident <malay>tak</malay>
so far <malay>pernah</malay>
then after that

(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul juga</malay>
(mm)

video <malay>tu</malay> [kan] I think ya no <malay>bukan nampak kereta dia kat</malay> #tampines# <malay>tapi</malay> I think I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay> video <malay>dia kat</malay> TikTok
<malay>sebab biasanya</malay> usually <malay>kalau ada</malay> accident <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan</malay> upload <malay>dalam</malay> TikTok
so that's where I get my news also [lah] TikTok and Instagram
ya
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] so talking about the news (um) do you follow <malay>tak</malay> the the <malay>punya</malay> politician <malay>semua</malay>
the presidential debate
(mm) I <malay>nampak tapi</malay> I <malay>macam tak faham</malay>
ya so
<malay>faham</malay> [lah]
I understand
so ya so then [kan]
[ah] you know actually this year
<malay>sepatutnya</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> !hais!
you know <malay>kena</malay> save money [lah]
save money so that I can like buy a house here
and then you know (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the houses here <malay>pun sekarang</malay>
getting more expensive and <malay>kalau tak</malay> I <malay>kena</malay> you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak pandu kereta</malay> [kan]
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] [eh] you <malay>ada</malay> siblings <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>adik</malay>
[oh] I <malay>tak tahu pun</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> siblings
[ah] okay
okay so your big brother <malay>buat apa</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] [oh] that's very good
okay
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] I <malay>ni</malay> [kan] only child
ya
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I <malay>kena</malay> take care of them [lah]
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] they are walking around in singapore
so then it's like
I <malay>takut</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada apa apa yang jadi</malay> especially <malay>bila</malay> that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] parents <malay>ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni</malay> [kan]
<malay>bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni</malay> [kan] COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
<malay>risiko tinggi</malay> [kan] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>keluar sebab</malay>
it's like if you have in the reports [kan] it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
<malay>macam</malay> diabetes high cholesterol
you know or (uh)
(err) like <malay>macam mak</malay> I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous [lah] to to <malay>bahaya</malay> [lah] to go out
and actually touch all these
things in public [kan] and taking the public transport and <malay>dia ambil</malay> <malay>juga</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
so that's why <malay>memang tak nak dengar</malay> [lah] so <malay>susah sikit</malay> [lah] so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is <malay>sudah semakin kurang</malay>
so <malay>nampaknya macam</malay> okay we're getting better
and looking forward to phase three [lah]
but then you <malay>tahu tak</malay> what is the difference between phase three <malay>dengan</malay> phase two <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
okay
ya
[oh]
(mm)
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>yang tu</malay> [jer]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> activity <malay>tu</malay> not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
ya
[ah] <malay>betul juga</malay>
ya [lor] that's true
but then like travel bubble <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh cadangkan</malay> travel bubble you <malay>rasa</malay> travel bubble <malay>dengan siapa</malay>
if let's say you were the prime minister
you get to pick five countries <malay>yang mana lima</malay> country <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>rasa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
you <malay>nak</malay> travel bubble <malay>dengan</malay>
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> philippines <malay>dengan</malay> indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is (uh) <malay>dengan</malay> indonesia
ya because the two of them <malay>sekarang ni memang tengah</malay> competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
of the highest number of COVID cases
so <malay>rasa macam</malay> I don't I would not feel safe <malay>kalau</malay> we have travel bubble <malay>dengan mereka</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] new zealand new zealand is good ya <malay>memang cantik</malay> and I heard the prime minister is very good also (mm)
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases [lah] <malay>di</malay> <malay>di negara dia</malay> [kan]
ya
so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] so <malay>biasanya</malay> you <malay>ada baca</malay> news [kan] Channel News Asia
(mm)
okay
<malay>yang macam mana yang ada apa</malay> like
<malay>apa</malay> rapist <malay>siapa</malay>

<malay>esok</malay> (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> !aiyo! so everytime
(uh) <malay>kerja memang kerja</malay> from work from home [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> once I think about <malay>kerja</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> stressed <malay>sikit</malay> because I've been working twenty four seven
so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I need a break [lah]
ya
as if [lah] it's so easy [kan]
I <malay>tak boleh</malay> visit <malay>rumah orang tua</malay> [lah] [sia] COVID
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> visit <malay>orang tua tak boleh</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
it
<malay>malas</malay> [lah] I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>kat duduk kat rumah</malay> I sleep <malay>cukup</malay>

so ya
so then
so today
my house mate [kan] <malay>dia balik</malay>
then <malay>dia tidur kat sini</malay>
boyfriend <malay>dia tak ada</malay> so boyfriend <malay>dia</malay> <malay>tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri</malay> [lah] so
so then [oh] (uh) so that's why this morning
I'm
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast <malay>dia ada</malay> buy one for one
so the breakfast wrap was only four dollars sixty five cents
but
(uh) it's one for one so end up the thing became only two dollars [lah]

[oh] <malay>dah lama ke</malay>
<malay>berapa lama</malay>
!wah! that's very good
okay but it's not too late for me to start
because I because I <malay>masih muda lagi</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
so I <malay>ni kena</malay> like willing to take the risk [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) <malay>betul betul</malay>
okay <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay>
okay
okay <malay>bagus</malay>
[ha]
!huh!
okay
for [lah] [oh] okay
<malay>tapi</malay> because
if you want to invest in the share market you <malay>kena apa ni</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or <malay>bukan macam tu</malay>
[ah]
so <malay>macam macam</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya <malay>kalau gitu pun</malay>
[ha] <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
okay
(mm)
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> investment
<malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>susah sikit</malay> that's why I need to start thinking about my future [kan]
then like worried about like money and then <malay>sekarang</malay> job I <malay>ni pun tak ada</malay> commission
so I <malay>kena</malay> that's why I <malay>sekarang ni sibuk nak cari</malay> back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
unless we have this type of project [lah]
project project <malay>macam ini kalau kita ada lebih</malay> then I don't have to worry so much
ya you know a little bit of extra do no harm [lah] [kan]
(mm)
so
<malay>kalau</malay> project project <malay>macam ni memang</malay> [lah] I <malay>nak</malay> join
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
so <malay>rasanya tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> (mm)
the share market investment I <malay>memang</malay> interested [lah] but then like
not right not right now only that I want to take my time and then we see what happens [lah]
(mm)
<malay>memang nak</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab tu</malay> that's why originally I was saving up my money <malay>untuk apa ni</malay> (um)
<malay>untuk</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>nak belajar</malay> <malay>sepatutnya</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tu juga memang mahal</malay> <malay>kat</malay>
<malay>enam puluh ribu lebih susah</malay> [lah]
ya
so and and then actually
I <malay>rasa macam kalau boleh</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> study medicine <malay>juga tapi</malay> medicine [kan] I was thinking should I actually like
(mm) just
you know
have a career change
so but then career change <malay>susah sikit</malay> because like
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> career change where do I start even [kan] so <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay> medicine medicine <malay>pun mahal</malay>
medicine is <malay>kira kira kalau kita</malay> study <malay>dekat</malay> australia
<malay>tiga ratus ribu lebih</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>yang tu boleh</malay> but then but then you need to have the other additional like training [lah]
[ah] other additional training <malay>kalau</malay> you study <malay>dekat</malay> australia <malay>boleh sebab</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> <malay>seorang kawan dia memang</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> study <malay>kat</malay> monash university and then <malay>dia</malay> doctor [lah] <malay>kat sini</malay>
ya and then we ya so
and then so that's why it's a bit like
but then medicine <malay>tu mahal</malay> [lah] so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so <malay>susah sikit</malay> [lah]
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] that's why I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay>
no it's okay <malay>yang tu</malay> is out of the window I <malay>tak mahu</malay>
I <malay>nak kerja untuk diri sendiri</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I <malay>tak</malay> dependent [lah] on anybody
so ya
(mm)
parents okay [lah] [kan] parents <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi susah sikit</malay> [lah] because you know <malay>memang</malay>
like singapore living cost is a bit high
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you <malay>kena</malay>
save a little bit more to make sure that you know that your parents are well taken care of [lah] so
<malay>rasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
step by step I guess one day at a time
(mm)

<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>nak duduk</malay> Vespa <malay>kalau</malay> public transportation <malay>memang ada</malay> air con
so then I was like a bit like
then <malay>tapi</malay> ya so no [lah] but it's not just that it was like I <malay>dah memang dah bagi tahu yang</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend
<malay>tapi dia masih muka tebal</malay> [tau] and then <malay>dia masih</malay> text I so I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest <malay>dengan dia</malay> and I <malay>bagi tahu</malay> [lah] that like
(um) I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have (err) to go (uh) with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
[ah] so I <malay>rasa macam dia tak ada</malay> boundary actually the thing was
I only save <malay>nombor dia sebab dia cakap</malay>
that <malay>kalau</malay> next time I <malay>nak</malay> reserve table I <malay>boleh</malay> call <malay>dia</malay> so I <malay>ingat</malay> like service <malay>dia bagus ke apa</malay> I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
<malay>kat</malay> Holey Moley <malay>yang dia ni memang baik ke apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> turns out <malay>dia ni memang tak</malay> like like
<malay>asyik kacau</malay> I [jer] so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> a bit
weirded out
(mm) <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
(uh) <malay>saya rasa</malay> I <malay>saya tak nak</malay>
I <malay>memang dah berterus terang</malay> I <malay>dah cakap</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend
then after that <malay>dia</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap</malay> [oh]
(um)
<malay>dia cakap</malay>
[oh] (um) I okay [jer] (uh) because <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh]

I <malay>tahu</malay> you you you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak nak</malay> hang out one on one
<malay>tapi</malay> I okay [jer]
then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the way he responded to it was very
(mm) disrespectful because it's like
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it <malay>ke tidak</malay> because you are
like
you know (um) single so of course it's okay with you
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>atau</malay> girlfriend I don't think it's
it's nice of you to do that
[ah] so <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
then then <malay>aku tanya dia</malay> just you and I then <malay>dia cakap tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan kawan</malay> I
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
<malay>aku cakap terus terang dah</malay>

so I was but <malay>bukan</malay> I <malay>yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak</malay> I then I was like
okay
then I said [oh] weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
<malay>mungkin</malay> you <malay>kena panggil</malay> (uh) then I said (err) maybe you just enjoy with your friends [lah] and have a good
time and and happy birthday in advance
<malay>pas tu dia cakap</malay> (um)

[oh] (uh) don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free

I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
[a'ah]
I <malay>memang dah tak bagi</malay> signal <malay>apa</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> (uh) it it's totally no signal it's disconnected

disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
ya but any way <malay>aku dah tak</malay> reply <malay>dia</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya <malay>betul juga</malay>
ya
<malay>kali pertama</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>dah pernah</malay> happen a number of times
!huh!
no [lah] I mean (uh) no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this (um) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so (um)
<malay>kalau tahu tak</malay>
in london COVID nineteen <malay>memang dah</malay> (um)
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
(mm) <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>dalam kat</malay> australia
(mm)
so they are all back in lockdown
(mm)
(mm) I think so
(mm)
(mm) <malay>yang tu pernah</malay> happen <malay>dalam</malay> japan <malay>pun</malay> and then now they said that the
the virus <malay>dah</malay> mutate
and the infection is is more (um)
the the virus is more infectious
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul juga</malay> but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so <malay>yang tu yang susah</malay> [lah]
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> vaccine <malay>sekarang pun macam ada</malay> side effect
because I think <malay>sekarang ada tiga</malay> company <malay>yang tengah buat</malay> vaccine
(uh)
no there is one that's Sanofi albert <malay>dengan</malay> AstraZeneca
Pfizer <malay>juga</malay> I think all of them are on board with that <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni</malay> albert <malay>memang memang apa ni</malay> (uh) <malay>memang</malay> aggressive to to do COVID because I <malay>nampak ada</malay>
job offers
for a number of (um) albert <malay>punya</malay> infectious disease department
(mm)
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dia tak</malay> call I <malay>balik</malay> because I <malay>tak ada</malay> experience <malay>dalam</malay> infectious disease <malay>kot</malay>
(mm)
ya
<malay>mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana</malay> [lah]
you
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
become prolonged because
(err)
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
(uh) nationwide
<malay>yang</malay> U <malay>orang</malay> <malay>dengan dengan</malay> like
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
so that's why it turns out everybody <malay>pula yang terkena</malay> COVID
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang ni</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah]

okay thank you bye bye

(mm) <malay>pada pendapat saya</malay>
currently I haven't get my letter [lah] but
(um)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> I want a fit body because (err) I <malay>suka main bola</malay> (err) football [kan]
so (err) <malay>kalau</malay> I'm more fit I can you know run faster (err) I can play better I can improve my performance [ah] in game
(err)
[kan] you <malay>tahu</malay> I <malay>main untuk</malay> (err) <malay>kelab bola</malay>
(err) <malay>dan</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
(err) I <malay>juga suka pergi</malay> gym I like
<malay>bila</malay> I go to gym I
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me [lah] over good looks but
of course <malay>kadangkala</malay> like of course everyone wants to have good looks [lah] you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks [what] so (err) ya [lah] ya got pros and cons [lah] for both but
(err)
if I had to pick one then
(err) <malay>mungkin</malay> I pick the fit body [lah]
how about you
(mm) <malay>yang tu betul juga</malay> (err)
going by that thought process <malay>kalau gitu mungkin</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> [ah] good looks [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> [pe] good looks <malay>tu</malay> (err) <malay>semua</malay> genetics <malay>tapi</malay> fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get [lah] you know then
(err)
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body [lah] but for good looks (err) if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it [what] so it's all down to genetics
(err) <malay>tapi bila dah tua</malay> (err) <malay>semua tu</malay> good looks <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay>
(err)
<malay>kalau</malay> long term
<malay>aku rasa</malay> fit body <malay>lebih penting</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab untuk</malay> (err) general health and well-being [kan]
(err) to fit body
(err) hopefully [lah] can you know live a healthier life and (err) not have any like
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes <malay>ke apa</malay>
(err)
!wah! your question so deep
(err) <malay>kalau gitu</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> everyone (err) <malay>selalu cakap pasal</malay> (err) global warming <malay>ni</malay> global warming <malay>tu</malay> our climate change <malay>ke apa</malay> I mean you just look at our weather [lah] everyday also in the forecast also always wrong [one] they say rain won't rain will be so hot then <malay>kalau</malay> (err) <malay>hujan pun</malay>
can have sun sometimes then it's like <malay>macam air panas aje</malay>
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
so I feel like (err) humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors [lah] (err) <malay>mungkin</malay> like slowly over time when the sea levels rise <malay>ke</malay> then all the you know <malay>kampung</malay> by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like <malay>mungkin</malay> will have (err)
<malay>lebih banyak</malay> (err) natural disaster <malay>semua</malay>
tsunami <malay>ke gempa bumi ke</malay>
ya
so
<malay>ataupun kalau bukan itu</malay>
extinct <malay>mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada</malay> COVID [kan] <malay>tu</malay> virus
<malay>tu</malay> virus <malay>semua</malay> like
especially <malay>kalau tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kalau</malay> singapore okay [lah] <malay>sekarang itu</malay> case <malay>semua sudah</malay> fall a lot right
but if you look at other countries (um) a bit more difficult to control [lah] especially if the country is very big right and
<malay>mungkin dia orang punya</malay> culture <malay>semua berbeza</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
(err) maybe they are more how to say like social like
(err) <malay>mereka suka peluk semua</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
could be a reason [lah] if let's say like scientists (err) cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
<malay>ini dua faktor</malay> [lah] <malay>yang mungkin akan</malay> [ah] <malay>menyebabkan</malay> (err) we as humans to go extinct [lah]
how about you what you think
you <malay>cakap pasal</malay> africa [kan] <malay>tadi aku ingat</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>kat sekolah</malay> we learn about econs right (err) they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then <malay>aku teringat</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (err) (err) extreme hunger (err) <malay>yang</malay> disrupt <malay>disebabkan oleh</malay> poverty [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
I feel <malay>mungkin</malay> that's another reason [lah] there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like (err) humans slowly like the population reducing [lah] I'm not sure if you <malay>boleh sampai</malay> extinct <malay>semua tapi</malay>
(err) I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer <malay>yang miskin jadi lebih miskin</malay> then (um)
you know from all this (err)
hunger and starvation maybe like
(err) people will like the population will eventually get reduced [lah] cause
(err) all these (err) kind of (err) things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system <malay>tak kuat</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
(um)
if if this I mean don't know [lah] maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa [lah] of course other countries also you see the
the income inequality <malay>makin naik</malay> and the
ya [lah] so maybe the if the government don't do (um) anything to <malay>tolong</malay> [kan] the <malay>orang yang miskin orang yang</malay>
<malay>tak mampu</malay> then (um)
maybe [lah] this could be a factor that might contribute but <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>bukan</malay> main cause [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>menyebabkan</malay> (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) extinction of humans
(mm) ya ya
skill <malay>tu</malay> you like do you mean like (err)
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
[oh]
(mm) (err)
I mean
if that's the case right I mean maybe <malay>untuk saya</malay> [lah] (err)
I hope to be able to how to say <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>boleh</malay> read people better [lah]
cause <malay>kalau gitu</malay> I can I <malay>boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu</malay> and I can like (um)
better like not say change myself [lah] but like (err) how to say like relate to them and like
(err) whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly [lah]
I (err) <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>bukan saja cara</malay> you <malay>cakap tapi</malay> (err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> (err) body language <malay>intonasi semua</malay> (err)
(err) ya [lah] <malay>itu</malay> like that's one of the first skill like I feel like (err) would be very beneficial [lah] and it's <malay>bukan satu</malay> skill <malay>yang senang untuk belajar pun</malay> it's like
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level [lah]
then maybe another skill would be like
(err)
<malay>lebih banyak</malay> confidence [ah] like especially (um)
<malay>dalam</malay> scenario <malay>macam</malay> public speaking <malay>depan</malay> (err) <malay>banyak orang</malay>
like the kind (err) it comes together with like
(um) like stage confidence [lah] not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people [lah] but like (err) <malay>buat</malay> (err) presentation <malay>ke</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> acting <malay>ke</malay> (err)
(err) performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like (um)
anything that has to do with like (err) maybe a high pressure situation or (err) like situations with like other consequence [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>pertandingan bola ke</malay> where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can <malay>dapat</malay> something [lah] you can win something at the end of the <malay>pertandingan</malay> [ah] so
like this kind of (err) situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say <malay>ada</malay> coach <malay>yang tengah</malay> scouting (err) player <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>baru yang</malay> young talent <malay>semua</malay>
(err) that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence [lah] I mean is (err) it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
(err) I feel like it's it's a very useful skill [lah] next time <malay>bila nak kerja semua kalau</malay> boss <malay>aku</malay> (err) <malay>suruh</malay> (err) <malay>buat</malay> presentation <malay>depan</malay> (err) colleagues <malay>aku semua</malay> then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation <malay>dia orang semua faham apa yang</malay> I <malay>nak cakap</malay>
(err) then
it's it's good [lah] in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
then (um) <malay>kalau</malay> the third skill maybe (err)
is more towards (um)
like being more optimistic (err) positive <malay>fikiran semua</malay> (err) mindset
<malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>aku nak yang</malay>
<malay>lebih ceria</malay> [lah] like I <malay>punya</malay> mood <malay>semua</malay> like
I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> any problem <malay>aku hadap</malay>
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset (err) <malay>kalau</malay> (err) as hard as it can be <malay>susah ke tak susah</malay> I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill <malay>ni penting</malay> cause it can help me to push through like let's say (um)
(err) gym <malay>kalau aku penat ke apa</malay> my next my next set I can just (err) keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
like
besides gym [lah] like (err) <malay>bola ke</malay> like next time <malay>nak kerja ke</malay> anything in life like I I feel like <malay>ni ni benda ni</malay> confidence <malay>dengan yang</malay> positive <malay>tu</malay> (err) <malay>sangat penting</malay> [lah] but <malay>ia bukan</malay> skill <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>senang untuk</malay> (err) cultivate <malay>ini</malay> skill (err) <malay>mesti</malay>
<malay>ambil</malay> time <malay>yang lama</malay> [lah] <malay>mesti</malay> build up over time <malay>tapi kalau sekarang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>tiga-tiga</malay> skill <malay>ni</malay> !wah! <malay>paling</malay> best [ah]
[oh] third one <malay>macam</malay> like (err) it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
<malay>apa-apa pun boleh</malay> [lah]
!wah! <malay>kalau</malay> free <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau gitu</malay> overlap <malay>macam</malay> skill [kan] <malay>bukan saja benda</malay> physical
<malay>kalau gitu</malay>
(err)
<malay>sekarang sekarang benda yang</malay> high value [kan] <malay>yang kita kena bayar banyak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) let's say (err) gold <malay>ke</malay> or stocks <malay>yang</malay> property <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> free [kan]
free <malay>untuk kita sendiri ke</malay> free <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kalau gitu</malay> stocks [lah] <malay>kerana kalau</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> stocks <malay>yang banyak</malay>
I <malay>boleh jual</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu</malay> I can just use it to spend on whatever I want [lah] whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich [what]
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just (err) accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said [lah] in the condition given is that
<malay>dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi</malay> the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla <malay>ni semua</malay>
(err) <malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) involve <malay>dengan benda</malay> <malay>teknologi</malay>
<malay>semua ni benda</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> stocks <malay>semua naik naik</malay> exponentially [lah]
so like
(err)
if I <malay>boleh dapat ni benda semua</malay> I I can just you know (err)
increase my wealth from there [lah] whenever the stock market go up I can just (err) sell it if not I just hold on to it [lah] until the value is a good time to sell [lah]
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich <malay>boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua</malay> you know I can I can whatever that is material I can <malay>dapat dengan wang</malay> (err) I can I can have [lah]
ya
ya
for me [ah] probably
ability to teleport [lah]
<malay>kerana</malay>
like time is limited [lah] <malay>setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja</malay>
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time [lah] like
I <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tinggal di singapura ni</malay> singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
even then like
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> teleport you <malay>nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah</malay> you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
is is not a problem [lah] you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
just having that additional <malay>satu dua jam setiap hari</malay> I mean it could be even more for some people because
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
you can get more sleep your <malay>tidur</malay> is good you (err)
your health <malay>pun lebih baik</malay> (um)
you know you <malay>nak</malay> (err) like
<malay>ada orang</malay> [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> (err) very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until <malay>dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga</malay>
<malay>tapi bila ada lebih masa ni</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> spend time <malay>dengan keluarga ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke apa</malay> you know your family time is a is a very (err) important thing but I feel like in today's world is (err) is lacking [lah] because (err) people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like <malay>selalu kalau</malay> (err) <malay>jalan sesak</malay> traffic jam or accident <malay>hujan ke</malay> then you waste even more time [lah] so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic [lah] but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself [lah] if other people also then you <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday over the weekend <malay>pun boleh apa</malay> (err) so
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower [lah] I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like (err) maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing [lah] that
(err) would would benefit like
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you [lah] cause you can teleport you yourself and then <malay>semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
are you more of a marvel fan <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>lebih suka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>mungkin</malay>
<malay>untuk saya</malay>
(err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> hulk [lah] <malay>kerana</malay>
<malay>dia tu</malay> like
he's still a normal human being [lah] but <malay>bila dia marah</malay> then then only <malay>dia</malay> transform [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> like
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say [lah] with great power comes great responsibility [kan] so like
(um)
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation <malay>terhadap diri saya akan</malay> it will be very high [lah] from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
(um)
I feel like it's beneficial [lah] because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
<malay>tapi</malay> like as needed [lah] I can I can still possess
this (err) insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
<malay>kalau</malay> you
(mm)
I mean
<malay>untuk saya</malay> I feel like a lot of people like <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>banyak</malay> training like
(err) I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
like (err) <malay>semua orang selalu</malay> label me as like (err) buff strong whatever
but
especially <malay>dulu bila bila</malay> [eh] (err) start of this year right when I had the shoulder (err) shoulder surgery and all that
like
whenever I am injured [lah] like not just the shoulder surgery actually like <malay>dulu</malay> I <malay>pun ada</malay> ankle sprain <malay>ni semua</malay>
(err) whatever the case [lah] basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest (err) performance [lah]
I <malay>selalu</malay> (err) <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>hati tersinggung sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>kerana</malay> like
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
(um) be at the level that high level of fitness (um) because everyone (err) <malay>selalu tengok saya macam</malay>
they all look up to me as this (err) strong fit buff guy then
(um)
like <malay>bukan sahaja</malay> (uh) <malay>dari segi</malay> performance <malay>tapi</malay> like
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal</malay> (err)
<malay>badan saya</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
these so called good label can be (um)
<malay>boleh menjadi sesuatu yang</malay>
will come after you [lah] because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
as much as pressure <malay>tu tekanan tu</malay>
<malay>boleh tolong untuk</malay> (err) drive you motivate you <malay>tapi</malay> like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you <malay>memang</malay> your mood
is down [lah] like
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further [lah] you <malay>boleh</malay> cause <malay>itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam</malay> spiral
ya
so when you go into the spiral then (um)
<malay>dia mungkin</malay>
<malay>jadi susah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (um)
<malay>terukan aktiviti harian</malay> [lah] or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you <malay>nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun</malay> it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you <malay>memang bukan malas</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you <malay>nak</malay> just like
(err) just lay down in bed just like
<malay>dengar muzik ke apa</malay>
like
is it can become a real mood killer [lah] as much as like [oh] you think like (err) having this fit body like we said earlier [lah] <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
<malay>biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu</malay> label <malay>yang baik</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look [ah] like good like physical look
all (err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> at times can be a bad label also [lah] I feel but
I feel like this is the <malay>paling paling</malay> common [lah] <malay>yang</malay> label <malay>yang semua kawan-kawan saya</malay>
they just (err) placed on me [lah] ya
okay [lah]
dream occupation <malay>saya</malay> is (err) to be a physiotherapist [kan] so
that's one but
also in five years six years time <malay>lepas</malay> uni depends on my situation [lah] if especially
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>masih</malay> single <malay>ke</malay> I [dah] attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
(um) of course devote some portion of day to the person [lah] like
like (err) <malay>bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) partner
like
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person [lah] but okay (err) <malay>kalau kita</malay> assume <malay>tak ada orang tu</malay> I <malay>masih</malay> single I
<malay>masih tengah</malay> focus on my own goals
(err) <malay>lepas habis</malay> uni I'm probably be bonded to (err) one of the (err) government hospital [kan]
so
I mean
my work hours <malay>mungkin tak akan</malay> flexible <malay>sangat jadi</malay>
my my day will most likely be like
(err) going to work and all that then like
whatever free time <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>ada mungkin</malay> like
<malay>sekali seminggu</malay> [lah] I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like (um) like how to say like
(err) I I still like to keep fit [lah] as I grow older so (um)
if possible
I I still go to the gym you know (err) <malay>kalau tak cukup masa</malay> maybe just a short workout [lah] <malay>empat puluh lima minit ke apa</malay>
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend [lah] cause <malay>kalau</malay> you train <malay>seorang-seorang pun</malay> (err) after a while it it kind of
(err)
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff <malay>tapi</malay> ideally if you have always have (err)
a training partner especially a training partner who <malay>selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga</malay> very like
energetic you know (err) <malay>selalu</malay> (err) give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
<malay>bila dia</malay> spotting you [kan] then (err) I feel like that that would be ideal [lah] like this is the this is the minimum that I hope [lah] I just
(um) <malay>berharap</malay> like next time I I <malay>dapat macam</malay> work life balance [lah] <malay>orang cakap</malay> like
<malay>kerja pun</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> dream job I I enjoy my work I <malay>boleh tolong orang</malay> like especially like if I can
become like a private sports (err) physiotherapist after I [dah] <malay>habis</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> bond <malay>dengan</malay> (err) hospital government hospital right and (um)
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
(err) athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I <malay>tak tak cukup duit</malay> [lah] because this kind of service all can be quite expensive [lah] but I hope to be able to
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
<malay>tahap yang paling tinggi</malay> [lah] because like
<malay>bila dengan pertolongan daripada</malay> physiotherapy <malay>ni</malay> (err) you <malay>punya</malay> muscles <malay>semua</malay> like
<malay>boleh</malay> recover [lah] you <malay>punya</malay> recovery <malay>semua</malay> (err) <malay>lebih baik</malay> you you
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
<malay>jadi</malay> like
it's a it's a thing [lah] I feel like
I <malay>tak dapat jadi</malay> I <malay>nak kasih orang lain untuk</malay> experience especially athlete athlete <malay>yang masih muda masih ada</malay> potential <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mungkin boleh</malay> represent <malay>negara ke apa</malay> (err) ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario <malay>untuk saya</malay> [lah] like
(err)
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>kerja pagi ke apa</malay> or <malay>mungkin</malay> I gym <malay>pagi</malay> (err) <malay>kerja sampai malam tengok</malay> [lah] then
but of course <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>dah ada</malay> (err) <malay>orang lain dalam</malay> in my life [lah] like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule [lah] but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe <malay>sekali seminggu</malay> just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship [lah] cause I feel like it's
very very important to you know (err) commit yourself to the other person
<malay>kasih dia</malay>
<malay>kasih</malay> you <malay>punya masa kena</malay> sacrifice <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk dia</malay> cause (um)
of course it will include cost [lah] but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person [lah] so that would be that would be ideal for me [lah] ya
[oh] ya <malay>cakap pasal itu</malay> I forgot one of my passions is also to
(err) <malay>kayuh basikal</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> like
ideally if if my my working hours <malay>pendek sikit</malay> (um)
I <malay>boleh</malay> slot in <malay>masa untuk</malay> (err) girlfriend <malay>masa untuk</malay> (err) gym <malay>tapi juga untuk</malay> (err) cycling [lah] and
<malay>paling</malay> best <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>ada satu kumpulan</malay> cycling <malay>macam</malay> like a cycling <malay>bukan</malay> maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group [lah] then
like every maybe <malay>bila tak panas</malay> [lah] maybe
early morning <malay>ke</malay> (err) <malay>lewat malam ke</malay> then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling [ah] road cycling <malay>bukan</malay> (err) trail riding
(err) ya then
I feel [lah] that would be ideal for me [lah] because it's something I really enjoy and it
(err)
<malay>dia memastikan yang</malay> I <malay>masih aktif</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dah tua nanti</malay>
<malay>kerana</malay> gym <malay>mungkin</malay> after some time like <malay>bila dah tua</malay> (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
you <malay>punya</malay> joints <malay>semua mungkin ada</malay> another problem [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> cycling
(err) <malay>dia punya</malay> risks <malay>tu rasa kurang sikit</malay> [lah]
ya
<malay>walaupun orang kata</malay>
you you ride a bike on the main road or <malay>jalan raya</malay> [kan]
but
I feel like (err) <malay>asalkan</malay> you it could (err) <malay>ikut peraturan jalan raya semua</malay> you follow the rules you just play safe [lah] you are you <malay>pakai</malay> lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group [lah] is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
(err) more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine [lah] ya anyway like
I <malay>bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa</malay> I just like for casual for enjoyment like
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) general health and well-being <malay>sahaja</malay> [lah] but
it's a fun way [lah] for me <malay>untuk untuk dapat</malay> [kan] (err)
<malay>kerana</malay> gym
like
your muscle will build up but
(err)
you <malay>punya</malay> cardiovascular health you <malay>punya jantung semua tu tak akan</malay> (um)
won't be trained as much [lah] <malay>tapi kalau nak buat</malay> cycling <malay>ke untuk</malay> you <malay>lari ke apa</malay> your
your this <malay>apa</malay> cardiovascular health will (err) <malay>naik</malay> [ah] you will improve <malay>boleh</malay> maintain <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (um)
(err) in the long run [lah] is <malay>aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin</malay>
(err) <malay>tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau</malay> ideal scenario I <malay>nak</malay> [lah] <malay>kerana</malay>
each ride will take about what <malay>dua jam</malay>
especially if it's like a a decently long ride [lah]
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause <malay>kalau</malay> gym <malay>empat puluh minit</malay> you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay [lah] but (err) <malay>kalau</malay> cycling you <malay>kena</malay> gear up <malay>semua</malay> you
<malay>jumpa kawan</malay> and then you go for your ride it it takes a while [lah] and <malay>mungkin</malay> along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some <malay>minum</malay> slight <malay>makan</malay> just snacks then
it takes time [lah] so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in (err)
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
(err) girlfriend [lah] ya

#syed's# gonna what
why
ya
(mm)
he don't know how to find job is it
!huh!
[oh]
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
(mm)
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment [eh] where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
!wah! I'll be great and that [sia] andre sure [sia] will be good at that
he always he always !huh!
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
!wah! snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
(mmhmm) I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
!huh!
<malay>buat lagi buat lagi macam mana kau tidur dalam lubang</malay>
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I also cannot like <malay>panas</malay> [sial] only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay [lah] he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay <malay>katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun</malay> [kan] but I cannot like the bed very comfortable [lah] then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I <malay>turun bawah</malay> already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast <malay>dah ada</malay>
he doesn't I mean he will cook [lah] once in a while but lately we've been buying (err) he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from [sia] he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed <malay>mandi</malay> take out his clothes and stuff and all that [lah] so
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
then he was okay he he still can <malay>layan</malay> okay ten thirty <malay>aku tak bangun kadang-kadang</malay> I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then [ah] because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay [lah] my alarm ten thirty (uh) no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep [lah] bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him [lah] whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
[oh] so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick [ah] just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because <malay>kau orang pemalas</malay>
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know [ah] it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like [oh] he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making [eh] like it's pointless like I told andre because (uh) last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle [lah] so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me [lah] but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices [what] anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be [sia] so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise [ah]
(mm)
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
#syed# better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar [what] and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself [lah] like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose [lah] but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve [sia]
I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he <malay>makan</malay> lunch already he go back to office
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like [oh] (um)
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
(mm) same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there [lah]
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already [what] tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
with andre I'm thinking whether I should get him a <malay>batik</malay> shirt [ah] to match me but <malay>kedai mana ada jual sekarang</malay>
on a saturday
but it sure is
<malay>pukul berapa dia orang buka dia orang buka tak</malay> saturday
<malay>pukul berapa dia orang buka</malay> because if
upper #joo chiat#
arab street <malay>punya mahal</malay> #doh#
cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or #tangs# I think and then I was thinking okay by the time <malay>kita habis</malay> we will probably be eating dinner
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one [what] so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking <malay>kalau dia orang buka pagi</malay> then I can go and buy first
and then <malay>harap-harap</malay> [ah] <malay>dia boleh muat</malay>
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got <malay>baju</malay> that will match that colour <malay>dia ada baju yang boleh</malay> match <malay>ni</malay>
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts [ah] but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see [ah] I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
he will eat [lah] he will eat he he he likes food in general babe <malay>dia tak</malay> picky when it comes to <malay>makan dia tak</malay> picky like even when you spicy like deepavali <malay>aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk</malay>
then he eat but it was really spicy for you [ah]
he eat but he's still white
so like white people [kan] standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
[oh] my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one [what] I mean if you are near the area then ya [lah] if not it'll be very troublesome for you [what]
!wow! I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope [ah] out of curiosity
when is #syed's# birthday
january what
[oh] my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini [lah] but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs [what] your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
do it do it do it <malay>babi</malay>
!wah!
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them [one] know in like the last message I got was that [ah] [oh] it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
(hmm)
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
!aiyo!
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
ya I must like spare my <malay>baju-baju</malay> or what I mean I have some of like my my things there but I don't have my clothes there I have my workout stuff I have my my boxing gloves are there
my some of my underwear is there
like I already have a toothbrush there and he already bought a shampoo for me that's there so like that one all <malay>tak payah fikir</malay> [lah] but other than that he's bald what he want to wash

[eh] how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
<malay>ini yang kau cakap apa</malay>
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
<malay>bodoh</malay> [seh]
<malay>sedih</malay> [oh] <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>kau faham tak faham</malay> the question I give you one more chance I had to like <malay>balik</malay> and google <malay>apa ni</malay> aspiration <malay>aku tak ingat aku macam</malay> something like [oh] I want them to be inspired and [ah] like push themselves like for their art and creativity and with their talent set or with the skill set that I have I want to pass it on to the trainees
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so (err) intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic [what] two people [ah] and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
<malay>penat penat</malay> [seh] <malay>asyik kau kerja</malay>
<malay>bila kau</malay> start <malay>kerja baru ini</malay> fourteen december <malay>berapa minggu</malay> [jer]
excited the place is near your house <malay>kenapa tak mana kerja aku</malay> cause <malay>di sini</malay> [sia] <malay>ada macam</malay> some kind of progression
which is good
<malay>kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini</malay> !wow! that's fast [ah]
(mm) yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
(mm)
yes
!wah! that's that's okay too [kan]
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course [lah] once you are married you also want to have your own property too
so moving back into like your (um) <malay>cakap siapa tadi</malay>
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work [lah] for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though (um)
okay [lah] I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
<malay>bila dia orang boleh masuk</malay> singapore
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
<malay>apa tu barang</malay> fashion <malay>ke barang</malay> household <malay>rumah ke barang</malay> fashion <malay>jenama</malay> fashion <malay>orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>orang beli</malay> bag <malay>warna-warna buat apa</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa ribu</malay>
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking !wah! I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating (err) calorie counting app [lah] I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it [lah] okay
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so <malay>bodoh</malay> of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
that was so <malay>bodoh</malay> of me
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
later you help me out <malay>tolong aku</malay> I seriously feel so <malay>bodoh</malay> realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
[oh]
shoes I thought you like shoes
[oh]
[eh] but you will be more at the office part right
!huh! you have to also track just in case they need to run out
[oh]
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
really really except for those who are working shifts and <malay>dekat</malay> the
the duty area
finally after so long of working shifts <malay>penat</malay> [seh] <malay>kerja</malay> shift
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons [lah] but the thing is
<malay>bagus berharap kau boleh</malay> stay <malay>kat</malay> this job <malay>lama</malay> I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down <malay>ke apa ke</malay> and it's always like unexpected suddenly
<malay>dia cakap besok semua</malay> try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed [eh] I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily [ah]
but I think my weakness is <malay>makan asyik pergi makan</malay> [jer] as much as <malay>nak buat melipat</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> need to plan for the week
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days [oh] okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job [ah]
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
(err) there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping [one] but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth [ah] I think <malay>kena makan</malay> for like <malay>tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk</malay> the
[oh] okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
fifty dollars for the (um) the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses <malay>punya</malay> routine to relieve menses <malay>tu</malay>
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments [lah] this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay>
but but <malay>dia cakap kalau boleh makan</malay> more <malay>sayur-sayur</malay> but <malay>sayur pun kalau bagus</malay> like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food <malay>pedas-pedas tak boleh</malay> you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat <malay>pedas punya makanan</malay> because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet <malay>susu pun sama</malay> but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house [lah] we all cook this interesting dish [lah] so it tasted like those #kung# #pao# chicken so instead of using <malay>santan</malay> the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use <malay>macam</malay> make up for it <malay>macam</malay> it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually [kan] I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based (um) their kidney <malay>macam</malay> feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> quite a high stage diabetic [lah] then he had to (err) inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like <malay>macam</malay> too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that <malay>cara nak masak pula</malay> because we are so used to like <malay>masakan melayu masakan</malay> wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs [what] other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some <malay>buah-buahan</malay>
too <malay>manis</malay> yes but some <malay>buah</malay> got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
but okay [lah] I mean I found some recipes online so (err) chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff [lah] so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
<malay>nasi</malay> I <malay>makan nasi basmati</malay> so
<malay>penat</malay> because <malay>kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat</malay> three thirty [ah] <malay>menahan menahan</malay> taxi
no because I had to do some errands at home
I was stuck at home <malay>apa tu</malay> actually <malay>aku aku mahu</malay> see <malay>yang tu juga</malay> (mm) (mmhmm)
I know right you always take the bus early or late [oh] earlier <malay>lama dia</malay> then what did you do take train
[oh] where's her workplace [oh] area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
creamy meatball are there any other <malay>sayur</malay> inside your bowl
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else [ah] yes can request [ah]
!wow! <malay>mana ada ini</malay> [oh] I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place [ah] I don't like the inside [ah] so <malay>busuk</malay> cause I sat near the kitchen so <malay>sempit</malay>
<malay>benda leceh saya nak buat</malay> actually
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with (uh) this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
<malay>buat</malay> basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
<malay>nak perlu</malay> impact [oh] <malay>habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia</malay>
<malay>kau cakap apa</malay>
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
[kan] <malay>lepas tu dia cakap macam</malay> kind of (um) okay no
yes [lah] all the effort
hello
<malay>masa itu masa itu emas</malay> time is golden
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
she ask me that you haven't <malay>kahwin</malay> that time I thought you <malay>kahwin</malay> already then she ask <malay>kat apa</malay>
she say that time I fall down only I <malay>kahwin</malay> next year <malay>aku kau</malay>
what's that
[oh]
<malay>mana tahu dia orang tak tahu</malay>
want to be what <malay>dia cakap</malay>
who's that <malay>siapa tanya</malay>
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
you have to plan [lah] all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something [ah] you are so convinced to buy the item !wah! the person say <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] this one okay [ah] I try also
actually okay
maybe they are selective [lah] yes <malay>yang macam cakap boleh bagus</malay>
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food <malay>makan sedap</malay> [jer] then what about those like unhealthy
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy [lah] to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch <malay>asyik-asyik makan</malay> sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew <malay>apa</malay> I mean it must be strong in #kimchi# flavour
<malay>besok kerja sepuluh</malay>
#onigiri# #onigiri#
<malay>kenyang tak</malay> why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up [oh] just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
[ah] we wanted to eat sushi salmon #mentaiko# I think I'll just order that when we go to #hei# sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon #mentaiko#
it wasn't that bad but okay [lah] yes #ramen# spot is the best like <malay>kat mana</malay> opposite #lau pa sat# <malay>kasih</malay> area #gyudon#
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at #lau pa sat# <malay>yang dekat</malay> #lau pa sat# <malay>itu</malay> is it like the soy based or the #miso# based or
yes bring me there
I saw that I saw the person <malay>macam mana dia apa</malay> sushi cake [eh] the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon #mentaiko# all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before [lah] the cuts I let you try before the say #inadi# with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and #mentaiko# torched
let's go eat that tomorrow [oh] that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
it's filling [ah] <malay>kenyang</malay> [ah]
home based food or outside food
#pucailok# the long bean with like <malay>asam</malay> I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side <malay>nasi</malay> you how about you
choose one

and my name is #haziqah#
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay [ah] (um) just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today [ah]
ya so two more days before friday !woohoo! and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
[oh] so you go back to school all the way
!wow! we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
[ah] the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
<malay>adalah kaedah</malay> get in the workers are you get everyday
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
<malay>kuih suji</malay> is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
[oh] I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause [ah] number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but [eh] actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having [eh] a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's (uh) I don't think that it is (uh) economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like [oh] hello good morning like greet them and then (um) scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so (um) ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause (uh) it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like <malay>berat</malay> it's just so heavy and
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like [oh] my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues [ah] they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
[eh] I don't know [eh] I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
<malay>ada aku kisah</malay>
!wow!
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like [eh] well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example [lor] then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like !aww! you got a forty seven [oh] I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on (um) students (uh) to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
(um) and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to (um)
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics [lah] so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like [eh] you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like [oh] english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue [oh] and like
[oh] and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like [oh] like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like [eh] you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
(um) only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena [eh] novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than (err) poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into [ah] mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching (um) teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where [eh] you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly [what] that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like (um) india or
at any
any colonised (um) sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce (mmhmm) scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that [lah] that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
(uh) I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this (um) having that divide you know (uh) haiti versus the dominican republic
#puerto rican#
!wow!
ya [lor] so
[oh] also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in #jakarta# per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their [ah] ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world [leh] even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are (um) there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around (um) say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them [what] at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
<malay>malas nak layan</malay>
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
like really <malay>tak kisah</malay> like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that [lah] even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like [oh] it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like [oh] say like in primary school you don't have like [oh] you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
you the <malay>minah</malay> that's very <malay>bising</malay>
<malay>mulut besar</malay>
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
why would I wash my <malay>selimut</malay>
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then (uh)
I'm tired
stop yawning
!wow! okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
#kaypoh# boy #kaypoh#
(mm)
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue !duh! is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds [ah] cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with #gingy# though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
(mm)
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
[oh] speaking of that right (uh) there's this tweet saying that (uh) what [ah]
(uh) the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just (uh) what do you call it [ah]
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
[eh] doesn't make sense [oh] is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like (um) south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it
