sorry [ah] why why what happened
okay which man U game was that (mm)
[oh] I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
<malay>macam main bawah blok</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay> bro
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david #moyes# you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when #thiago# was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
[eh] anyway <malay>sekarang</malay> david #moyes# <malay>kat mana</malay> [siol]
[ah]
[oh] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> manage west ham [oh] west ham [eh] [ah] how did west ham do in their [oh] they lost against new castle
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games [ah]
am I right okay never mind (err) who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch [tau] it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw #thiago# go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
and you know we we've got these we've got these <malay>dia macam kau macam</malay> you just look at this guy
and you're like okay <malay>dah</malay> settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
(mm)
okay
(uh huh)
that philosophy [ah]
okay
the same louis #van gaal# were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
(mmhmm)
okay
ya
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
so that's why #mourinho# <malay>selalunya dia nya</malay> team (err) their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
I see
okay
!wow!
so he's like the empty football guy
(uh huh)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay that's that's the same school [ah]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
just whack [ah] basically [ah]
[a'ah]
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
#klopp# and #mourinho# <malay>ni macam dorang macam</malay> opposite sides of the spectrum [ah] in a way [ah]
#klopp# denies you space #mourinho# #mourinho# gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with [ah] but [ah] okay [lah] I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean !wow! wonderful game from a

how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone <malay>aku</malay>
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years [ah] actually I can play on my iPad also [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] anyway [ah] I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing [ah] cause you know I've just (uh)
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
(err) I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically (err) [ah] I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
(err) so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated (err) Netflix show
I I like what Netflix does these days [eh] <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
okay but anyway (err)
[sial] [lah] bro that [one] <malay>macam</malay> for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
<malay>kau</malay> #zuleika# #zulkifli# actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix [lah] cause
what happened was (uh) when september now [eh] so last month (err)
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
(err) I was like okay [lah] feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
!hey! there's this #anelka# documentary on Netflix
[ah] have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this #anelka# documentary [ah] so so it's (uh) it's a
tell all documentary [ah] an #anelka# and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything <malay>macam</malay> basically
<malay>aku rasa nama dia macam gitu</malay> [ah] I mean he's muslim name is supposedly #bilal# but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
like one was the the france <malay>punya</malay>
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause (err)
raymond dominic actually like (uh) had a an argument with #anelka#
and <malay>macam pada</malay> #anelka# it was not fair [ah] like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
I got into Netflix cause of that #anelka# documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows [lah] but some like (err) okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai [ah]
okay so so so basically <malay>macam</malay> I've watched cobra kai I've watched (err) I mean I don't tend to watch the series [ah] I would watch like documentaries or <malay>macam</malay> movies [ah] so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting [ah]
(err) social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now (uh) it's about how <malay>macam</malay> Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> basically
<malay>dorang tahu</malay> like what attracts you what what you're interested in (uh)
so <malay>dorang buat macam</malay> (uh) and if not an avatar they like what do you call it [lah]
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like [oh] they sell the data
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like <malay>macam</malay> they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why <malay>macam</malay> Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation [ah]
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
[sia] [ah] why do they think this way [sia] <malay>asal dorang fikir macam gitu</malay> like <malay>dia</malay>
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
(uh) am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
<malay>kau</malay> how can people just support [sia] <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya [lah] usually it's either very insidious thingy [ah]
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like [oh] you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting [lah] like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it [lah] so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and (err) it's about how this guy (err) I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder (err) ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you [lah] but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town [lah] that he's in
[ah] it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean [ah] okay [lah] so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places [ah] one is (err) knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america (uh)
(err) K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so [ah] basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like <malay>macam</malay> lost his faith a bit [lah] cause one of the themes of the movie
is (err) you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that [lah]
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so (uh) and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then (err) and then and then and then
after he has a son of his own he starts to <malay>macam</malay> go back to
like worshipping god [ah] no <malay>macam macam</malay> it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>orang beragama pun macam</malay>
<malay>kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu</malay> that sort of thing so <malay>macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang</malay> for like five years <malay>lepas tu dia macam</malay> [eh] #astgahfirullah# <malay>aku kena qadak balik solat aku</malay>
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
ya so so so that's a tragedy <malay>macam</malay> something happens and then after that he he has this <malay>macam</malay> love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story (err)
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted [ah] I mean in the movie they they they
[ah] not not just inner demons [ah] I mean they are just they are evil people [ah] you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is [ah] robert pattison
you know that twilight fella [lah] !huh! ya the glittery vampire so <malay>dia yang sekarang</malay>
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something [kan]
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but [eh] but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show [ah]
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie [ah]
[ah] well he doesn't he doesn't molest children [ah]
okay shouldn't stereotype (err) pastor <malay>dorang</malay>
[a'ah]
okay
are you sure you want to say this on (err) are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box [ah]
okay [lah] so it's an [lah] it's not the Android box <malay>yang</malay> Android box <malay>yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada</malay> [kan] <malay>tu benda</malay> [kan]
[oh] is it
so basically it's an [lah]
okay okay
[ah]
[oh] is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya [lah] they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five [ah] it's like not not even [ah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl [kan]
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
(mm)
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that (uh) they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no [lah]
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's (uh) not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
(err) groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans [lah]
no he was in house of cards and and (err) house of cards the final season just <malay>macam tergantung macam gitu apa</malay>
because of this [ah] so
so I mean like in singapore #dee kosh# obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening <malay>mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang</malay> cause of all the
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
religious upbringing to say like [eh] <malay>ni benda salah</malay> [sia] what am I doing you know that sort of thing so <malay>macam</malay> I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no [lah] no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like <malay>macam</malay> it won't have been like once every few months [ah] which is the situation you find it you find now [ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
alright
[oh] my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through [ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
he's he's a good kid [ah]
okay
[a'ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
okay
<malay>dia panggil kau</malay> sir but <malay>asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau</malay> [seh]
[oh] okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him [oh] you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya [lah] cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that #upskirtism#
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
so he actually did it
look [eh] look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates [ah] bro
check it out I I was wrong okay [lah] I mean I think I can tell this to the camera [eh] to the camera <malay>pula</malay> to the recorder okay I was from #serangoon# right
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name [ah] but but but I don't know but
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like <malay>ini</malay> #aizat# #adam# <malay>ni semua</malay> like [eh] ya [eh] [eh] you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school <malay>dulu</malay>
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude [lah] but but <malay>macam</malay>
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many (uh) malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you won't find a malay chap in the in that class [ah]
so basically he was in one of those classes [ah]
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him [lah] like I I remember of
his existence back this in [ah]
yes
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times <malay>nanti aku</malay> google <malay>aku</malay> check [kan] <malay>lepas tu aku aku aku</malay> forward <malay>dekat kau</malay> [lah]
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that (uh) inhibits our society [ah] but basically ya [lah] back to what we were saying <malay>macam aku rasa</malay> that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference <malay>apa betul tak</malay> like
ya <malay>macam</malay> one thing about us <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) compared to <malay>kita punya</malay> parents [eh] <malay>macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita</malay> tend to <malay>macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita</malay> you know like our parents <malay>aku rasa dorangnya</malay> generations is like <malay>kau kenal ni satu perempuan</malay>
within a few months <malay>tunang</malay> another few months <malay>kahwin</malay> you know that sort of thing
ya
what was that so so so you see [eh] <malay>macam</malay> what #ondre# said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different [ah] you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] it was a norm [ah] like [oh] your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay <malay>kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit</malay> or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants [ah] you know so <malay>macam</malay> like
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally [lah] cause he's from that country
<malay>orang</malay> pakistan <malay>kat sini</malay> will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now [ah] so maybe <malay>kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa</malay> then talk talk talk [eh] I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to [ah] but of course I mean
maybe I don't know [ah] maybe we're we're looking at it differently [lah] maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation [ah] from what I understand [lah]
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum [ah]
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that <malay>macam</malay> (err) #syed ahmad# was interested in your mother
sorry #syed ahmad# we didn't mean to mention your name
[oh] okay
[oh] okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
[ah] we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
(um) okay so what was that okay so basically <malay>macam</malay> ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing [ah] so <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>anak aku</malay>
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
ya
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya
I think girls these days they are like <malay>lagi beza dari kita macam</malay> in the sense that they are really pressured to
look and ya look and behave a certain way [ah] perhaps [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
well I mean what can you say [ah] these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on [ah]
and I guess people are just
following trends [ah] just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
susceptible to this [ah] <malay>macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa</malay> in a way [lah] but <malay>aku rasa untuk wanita ni</malay>
<malay>dorang lebih senang dipengaruh</malay> [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> [ah] [ah] like compared to guys [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife <malay>macam</malay>
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
[ah] <malay>kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah</malay> you know that sort of thinking you know
but now is like quite common [ah] you know nowadays you have mosque
where they provide a place for you to do the <malay>walimah</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] but you still had your your function in a activity hall [ah] my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
a still somewhat rare for the whole <malay>majlis</malay> from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like <malay>masjid mawaddah</malay>
(err) I mean there there are some !huh!
no but bartley is like <malay>macam</malay> bartley is is is so called not really
(err) subject to any of these trends I feel [lah]
you can [lah] you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
I'm trying to say is that <malay>macam</malay> nowadays you have instances where people do say like [eh] should we have our <malay>majlis</malay> in a mosque cause then like <malay>orang nak sembahyang</malay> and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding [what] you know in a way [lah] but of course
<malay>pada aku pun aku rasa macam</malay> if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a <malay>walimah</malay> a small <malay>walimah</malay> outside the mosque [ah]
ya
okay [ah] not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so <malay>macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam</malay> that was
something that that was on her mind like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] why are we doing it in the mosque <malay>abeh macam</malay> like [oh] I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
[eh] why you buying a three room flat [sia] it's so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure [ah] I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning [ah]
[ah]
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day you just have to be
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that [ah] you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house [lah] I don't know whether I told you
ya !huh! ya ya <malay>aku dah</malay> end of this month [eh] end of this month [eh] end of this year <malay>dah enam tahun</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak</malay> upgrade to <malay>macam</malay> five room <malay>ke</malay> [ah]
#sengkang# <malay>juga</malay>
bro bro #tampines# <malay>mahal</malay> bro #tampines# <malay>mahal gila</malay> no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> #abbas# <malay>nya</malay> parents <malay>aku</malay> #sengkang# <malay>apa</malay>
bro #sengkang# bro #raeesah khan#
[oh] sorry was that too loud jamus #lim#
(err) unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not #sengkang# but it's okay
no no this is #ang mo kio# so
basically basically okay basically basically #sengkang# right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale [lah] so for those people who don't know #sengkang# you know is divided into this so called <malay>macam</malay> four districts <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] so (err) anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this <malay>sungai</malay> [lah]
it's called the <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# I think [ah] so like if you look out my window here you can see the <malay>sungai</malay> [ah]
so that <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# (err) is the boundary between #sengkang# which is held by the workers' party and #ang mo kio# which is held by pinky work
[ah] sorry [ah] every conversation between #zulika# and myself must involve some degree of politics [lah] then you know there's some spice [ah]
so (uh) we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come (uh) we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good [ah] [ah]
I I don't want to play games [ah] I mean I think I would draw the line at games [ah]
ya
my wife my wife and I [oh] but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife [ah] okay
[a'ah]
okay

so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad [eh] you you should talk
you should talk to my cousin #abbas# [ah] who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me [eh] <malay>kalau kau suka</malay> breaking bad <malay>kau kena</malay> watch this better call saul [lah]
so <malay>aku macam aku ada tengok</malay> [ah] like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while <malay>aku macam</malay> how many seasons are there [oh] my god breaking bad only has five seasons

okay I I think roughly around at that point <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them [ah] okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
[kan] there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle <malay>dia macam terus</malay> didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya [lah] but he kept on <malay>macam</malay> like downplaying <malay>si</malay> jimmy <malay>nya</malay> achievement [ah] <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing [kan]
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago [sia]

[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[a'ah]
[sial] [lah] bro you could have read all the books [seh] in all that time [sia] bro
[oh] I heard of that but I didn't watch it
<malay>aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> once I see <malay>macam satu benda ni ada</malay> four five seasons [kan]
<malay>aku terus lemah</malay> [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> no [lah] I cannot watch this [sia]
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that (err) I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently [lah] so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys [lah] so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
!hey! siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass <malay>punya</malay> app
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
[ah] all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful [lah] I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
mine is after iPhone eight [lah] basically <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] so so so it's one of those things that I don't know [ah] Apple fan boys are talking about these days [ah]
double double tap then the code <malay>keluar</malay>
the scanner the scanner the scanner <malay>keluar</malay> not the code the camera thingy ya
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
it automatically scans the code [oh] okay
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code [ah] <malay>macam ni kau tengok</malay> <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
no no no that's that's if you can [lah] <malay>kat bawah tu</malay> [kan]
then it goes <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
there <malay>kat bawah kat bawah sini</malay>
it goes in a anti clockwise [eh] clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this <malay>dia macam</malay> go
like that
so (uh) #inshallah# with [ah] I also reciting <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> we will get our twenty dollars and (err) we can spend it on a steak later at #jalan kayu#
[eh] so so so (err) we're coming to the end
shall we talk about our favourite <malay>makan</malay> places since it's almost lunch
<malay>tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I've never heard of it being described as a good place [lah]
okay
babe <malay>aku pun aku pun</malay> I know I know (err) anchorvale
<malay>dorang ada</malay> the vending machine cafe [ah] if that's what you are referring to
[oh] I think I know what your day is referring to
the <malay>yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung</malay>
yes so <malay>yassin kampung</malay> they have this off shoot called <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot <malay>lepak</malay> one corner it it doesn't feel like the <malay>lepak</malay> place [ah] it feels like you just go in <malay>kau beli makan dekat</malay> no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
[ah] both [ah]
okay ya good joke but [ah] so then <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia macam tempat makan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay <malay>kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam</malay> queue up <malay>dekat</malay> the stall [ah] so it's like a hawker stall [ah] it's like a hawker centre
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like <malay>abeh kau kena pergi sana</malay> order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that <malay>makanan dia</malay> okay [lah] not bad [lah] but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> so so <malay>juga</malay> but it doesn't have the <malay>lepak</malay> feeling [lah]
because like <malay>pada aku lepak</malay> feeling <malay>macam kau kau duduk</malay> then like [eh] #bhai# <malay>teh tarik lagi satu</malay> [ah] [eh] if you want to go place you should go to #mahamoodiya#
but I mean it's a bit late for for #prata# #simpang bedok# [ah]
you don't know #mahamoodiya#
yes the one next to the Shell [eh] <malay>dorang dah</malay> up market [sia]
