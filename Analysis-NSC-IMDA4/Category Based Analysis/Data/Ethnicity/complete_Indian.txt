okay
alright <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay so basically <malay>aku tanya</malay> (uh) whoever living at my place first to do this [lah] cause I thought need to do at my house
then I <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>siapa</malay> #ham# boy <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) I they technically live near my place [what] so easier so I call them <malay>dua dua tak nak buat</malay>
I actually [oh] my god I forgot to tell ham he told me (uh) <malay>dia nak fikir dulu</malay>
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on [ah]
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
[ah] <malay>nanti kita</malay> sign up then wasted <malay>tak dapat macam mana</malay>
so I say that to him [lah]
no is based on <malay>macam</malay> first come first basis
(mm)
okay basically (err) my friend <malay>hantar aku ni</malay> okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
so they were looking for people to debate [lah] like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
[ah] I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate [what]
so (uh)
<malay>sekali</malay> suddenly she just sent me this [lah] so I actually thought this was a debate
[ah] so <malay>aku</malay> so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I [ah] call you [lah] (uh) I was looking for people [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #ham# boy
(err) I
actually one of my friend who stay <malay>kat</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay>
[ah] very near right <malay>tapi dia tak nak</malay>
like I don't I don't get some people <malay>punya</malay> mindset <malay>macam</malay>
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>satu jam pun tak boleh berbual</malay>
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
<malay>sekolah amacam</malay>
(mm)
seriously [ah]
okay
okay we don't talk about [lah] [eh]
is (err)
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
(uh huh)
[ah] right
that's the thing [ah]
[oh] my god <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>merepek</malay> no no no seriously
even
but government allow sport activity [what]
[ah] actually <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>kawan aku ni pasal</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> because the thing why they don't want [ah] ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
[ah]
so I call this guy he's known for speaking [ah] good malay
(uh) to mix we always mix
[ah] always any conversation we have automatic <malay>kita selalu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah] it's very standard [ah]
(err) okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have (err)
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay [lah] let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
[oh] my god
you know what
<malay>kita tukar</malay> question [jer] [ah]
<malay>tukar</malay> question
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
(mm) [ah] okay okay
so
let me guess <malay>kau kene kerja</malay> for
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
settle down relax there K <malay>dah</malay> settled
something like that
[ah] alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my (err) future [lah]
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
[ah] be a professional sports player
okay
(uh huh)
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer [lah] cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
(err) but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
[ah] so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money [lah]
[ah]
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific [lah] but
Singapore soccer is a no no [lah]
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay [lah] <malay>tapi nak</malay>
commit and [ah] <malay>macam apa</malay>
all macam #haziq#
[ah] that's a bit unrealistic the passion is (uh) actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of (err)
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life [lah]
[ah]
alright
sorry
[ah] true true Malaysia pay better
(um)
[ah] but then <malay>nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita</malay> [lah]
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower [ah]
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport [ah]
anywhere and everywhere
!wah! so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late [lah] I don't want to be late [lah]
ya so for example [ah]
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine I <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
the fifty nine second <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
(mm)
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching [ah]
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about [lah]
[ah]
so they talk about the <malay>dulu orang</malay> Turkey <malay>macam mana macam mana dorang</malay> settle <malay>hal</malay>
(uh) <malay>rumah tangga</malay>
(uh) <malay>musuh</malay>
<malay>cucuk belakang</malay> and all [ah] [oh] my god I tell you
it is an emotional story
(um) sad
<malay>berbual pasal sedih ada</malay>
<malay>marah sampai nak</malay> bang table <malay>ada</malay> serious serious it it was all emotion
but
no it's a series series
(mm) but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
(hmm)
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
[oh]
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class [ah] in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy <malay>macam</malay> the race to become first in class [ah]
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
then <malay>sekali</malay> come to primary five <malay>dah kerek</malay> [kan] two years in a row [ah] don't need study [ah] #lepak# [ah]
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well (err) in primary school
[ah] because
(um)
how to say [eh]
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no [lah] I mean that that's the problem [ah] because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have (err) you know
instead of the okay <malay>sekarang kita dah</malay> first in class [eh] <malay>kita</malay> focus [jer] how to be best in the cohort
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
so <malay>aku</malay> start <malay>bergaul dengan dorang</malay> be like them
#lepak# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tak belajar</malay> after oral
<malay>dorang semua balik</malay>
<malay>aku main</malay> catching
[ah] prank <malay>orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari</malay> you know
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
[ah] play soccer at the void deck all [lah] so
I will change my mindset [lah] but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay>
past <malay>tak terjadi</malay>
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this [ah] cliche phrase
but as annoying and cliche and you know like <malay>jijik</malay> as it is
it's true [ah] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example [ah] that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like !wah!
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song [ah] [kan] maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
[ah]
<malay>tapi kau tahu apa lebih teruk tak</malay>
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders [ah] basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start [eh] you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song [ah]
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because [ah] there was this video playing that song [ah] so like [oh] not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K [ah] I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
<malay>kau zaman bila ni</malay>
you know but I'm like [oh] ya [eh] nice song nice song [ah]
so it's damn annoying [ah] actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the [lah]
yeah [oh] my god <malay>dorang punya cara berbual</malay>
okay [lah] okay [lah] we cannot throw shades [lah] okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
(mm)
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
(um)
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries [ah] will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
some (um) country [ah] they you need to pay first know <malay>walaupun berapa</malay> critical <malay>apa dah nazak ke pe</malay> you need to pay first before the surgery happen
(mm)
ya
precisely
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's a sensitive (uh) topic
okay
let's see next question [eh]
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do (mm) very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
like <malay>dulu punya</malay> time [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example <malay>orang dulu</malay> we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds [lah]
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
(um) rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
let me phrase that ya what <malay>apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup</malay>
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need [ah] okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and [ah] okay basically iphone is good [lah] those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
(um) shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at #pasar malam#
and then
shoe (uh) twenty thousand [lah]
you know [ah] Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
[ah] bought a very expensive car [lah]
(uh) so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like [eh] you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like [oh] okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money [lah]
you want to show off
and all
give me their money [lah] I can put to better use
okay [oh] yes sorry
(mm)
(uh)
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>dia punya masalah yang betul</malay> [kan] is actually <malay>apa</malay> [tau]
life <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> life is so simple
but people just live to complicate it
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind <malay>ada je masalah</malay>
[ah]
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face [lah]
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do [lah] right
alright next question
[oh] this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
everyday activity [lah] <malay>bukan kerja ke apa macam</malay> K for me
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours [oh] my god
[oh] my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
<malay>nanti muak</malay> [pe]
and what <malay>jelak sama</malay> [jer] [lah]
yeah
ya so like
like they say [ah] everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
[eh] <malay>kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal sekolah</malay>
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different [lah]
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
<malay>macam apa tau dia punya ayam</malay> doesn't look good <malay>dia punya telur</malay> doesn't look good
so I'm like [eh] so there's now two shops [eh]
<malay>yang mana lebih sedap</malay> which one looks more appetising because for me
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food [lah] outside food the look is so important
(mm) (mm)
and
(mm)
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got [ah]
hopefully
[oh] you know what I just want to come [lah]
(um) next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
(err) [oh] okay okay [oh] okay okay
okay (hmm)
[oh] okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone [eh] sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
(mm)
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
intuition that I can read people face so like I know [oh] <malay>muka gini</malay> [ah] <malay>gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orangnya</malay>
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face [ah]
like [oh] <malay>muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini</malay> [oh] <malay>macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orang dia</malay>
okay I wouldn't say expert because
(err) I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right [lah]
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
I expected you to be a super <malay>mat rep</malay>
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on [lah] it was like what blonde
(err) <malay>perang perang</malay> [kan]
so actually !alamak! confirm <malay>mat rep</malay> [eh] <malay>fikir dia siapa</malay> [sia]
then I was like
[ah] see [ah] this [one] [ah]
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit [ah]
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the <malay>apa</malay> the headmaster <malay>apa</malay>
course head [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the
[eh] don't do this [lah]
you know what I mean you are like come on [lah] you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but #kena# our
you wanna get expelled is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
<malay>kau</malay> confirm <malay>menyesal sikt kenapa</malay> #hamizan# <malay>tak ingat</malay>
no comments
(um) okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
(um)
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
(um)
can [ah] but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is (err)
skill [eh]
what skill [eh] <malay>apa kita boleh buat</malay> let me see let me see
maths
[ah] I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths [ah] maths [ah] like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of (uh) discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me [ah]
[ah]
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
<malay>itu penting paling penting paling mustahak</malay>
yes
okay
<malay>aku tengah tengok dia orang punya</malay> question
it's good [lah] they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
!alamak! cannot search [ah]
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
I mean I heard of it before tapi <malay>macam</malay>
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning [lah]
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events [oh] basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
so me and cyprus skip class <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita ni</malay>
and <malay>terjumpa</malay> fabian
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny [lah] okay we skip class
then you know his (uh) <malay>dia punya cara marah macam mana</malay> [kan] see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding [ah] a serious scolding [ah]
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
<malay>takde</malay> [lah]
[ah]
I mean
it's hard [lah] it's hard
yeah
damn but
[oh] my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss [lah] definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it [lah] [eh] let's not throw shade to people [lah] [eh]
but [oh] my god I miss our class with
(uh) #ham# boy
S&W
(uh)
you only spend time when [ah]
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you [lah]
like that we really sit down and talk
[ah]
[ah] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was [ah]
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time [lah]
[ah] definitely <malay>adalah orang nak beli</malay> laptop so I can them like bombard them
[ah]
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
(um) graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay [lah]
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
(err)
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] my god
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
points better like <malay>apalah nak jadi</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup macam ni</malay>
you know what I mean
but
it's for me is <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] like I I can't believe [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
K [ah] <malay>kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk</malay> poly [kan] what what's the point
[ah]
and I have better options [ah] I have better prospect so
obviously [ah] <malay>kita macam</malay> you know what
if I'm gonna go this way
<malay>kita punya</malay> pathway <malay>macam gini</malay> [jer]
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do [ah] to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
ya <malay>macam</malay> is <malay>merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit</malay> [jer]
you know what I mean
<malay>abeh kalau kat rumah</malay> I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that [what] you know what I mean
like giving
precisely I <malay>aku</malay> it is
I find it super <malay>merepek</malay>
so it it made me like [oh] you know what [ah] so tiring [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah]
so
true [lah] true
yeah
<malay>abeh</malay> come by my house [lah] one once in a while
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free [ah]
cause I'm laying low a bit
[ah] I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things [lah] in the future
(mm) so you can actually come down
<malay>dah kat kat mana</malay>
three more right
(mm)
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
!huh!
[eh] #kim# <malay>cam</malay>

yes
<malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> [eh] (mm)
okay <malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> this about
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that [lah] this I guess this my fate [lah]
so if
in the past yeah fit body now [ah]
whatever god give me I'll take [lah]
like (uh) whatever it is [lah] good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again [lah]
like know because
if they give us like pre before you <malay>masuk</malay> right
<malay>dorang kata</malay> if we pass we get two months off know
<malay>siapa tak nak</malay>
[ah] but [oh] my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body [lah] like
okay for example <malay>kalau</malay> soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
we don't need upper body strength
<malay>kalau</malay> basketball [oh] definitely [ah] you need upper body strength [ah] but that means
like I pay for competition <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kau tahu kawan aku suruh buat apa</malay>
#izzul# <malay>kau jangan</malay> pass <malay>kau jangan</malay> shoot [eh] sorry sorry sorry
you don't pass don't shoot [eh]
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying [lah] because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
no no no K basically in basketball [kan] <malay>kalau kau main</malay>
if you look at the oppunent team [eh]
the best is usually the fastest
[ah] but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst [ah] offensively
[ah]
so
but I have to keep up with those (uh) because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
so my game and <malay>dorang punya</malay> game <malay>tak sama</malay> definitely they are better game sense than me
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
not to my knowledge <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang buat ni aku tak boleh</malay> counter
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not (um)
used to it [ah] like I'm not exposed to it [what]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
<malay>punya nasi ayam</malay>
<malay>dengan dorang punya sayur</malay>
for the rest of my life bro
<malay>tak kira apa-apa</malay> [lah]
frugal [eh]
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house [lah] because free [what]
right
[oh] chicken rice for the win bro
funny [ah] you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore !chey!
[oh] I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
you know because (uh) you have to understand in Singapore <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
chicken
beef
[ah]
correct so parents <malay>aku suka apa</malay> [tau] they like (err)
#kampung# chicken they make sure it's from a
not say #kampung# [lah] but you know #kampung# means they bring it up naturally
[ah] it it it you don't have to worry about the
others [lah]
(uh)
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival [what] the basic survival need
<malay>makanan air</malay>
[eh]
air <malay>bahasa melayu apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>angin tu</malay> wind
<malay>oksigen</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> <malay>dalam melayu</malay> properly [ah] [eh]
<malay>oksigen</malay> [ah] the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
O K S I
G E N <malay>oksigen</malay>
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe [ah] I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
<malay>kau punya</malay> okay [ah] let me see [eh]
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya !wah! I mean
true [lah] true
then <malay>tak tahu dapat dorang punya</malay> salary <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> families <malay>kat</malay> overseas <malay>macam mana</malay>
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
book reservation <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict [ah]
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
[ah]
correct
(mmhmm)
(um)
<malay>kalau dorang buat ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau dorang buat ni kan</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> tracking system <malay>pun senang tau</malay> actually you know what implement to all shops
<malay>dorang buat gini senang nak</malay> track <malay>orang</malay>
!wah!
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
(um)
like (uh)
<malay>untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai</malay> right
only for pioneer generation [lah]
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
[ah]
must use the [ah] reservation booking
yeah
<malay>tapi satu masalah</malay> will be <malay>apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) whether they have space or not and but come on [ah]
the
this is the problem right find solution [lah]
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who [ah]
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is [lah] [ah]
so we just have to take care of ourselves [lah] that's why you know [ah] like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot [ah] like
actually we don't have to go out always
okay [lah] playing sports and all is a different thing [lah] you need to you know move because like <malay>berapa hari lepas</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan</malay>
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play #takraw# <malay>kat</malay> #serangoon# <malay>sana</malay>
[ah] but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay [lah] you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
[ah]
correct
[ah]
ya because K want to #lepak# okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
[ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>kalau kita</malay> #lepak# <malay>kat luar</malay>
it is prone to have problems
[ah] <malay>kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa</malay> like we just do our own things
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay [lah]

no comments [lah] this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be [lah] [eh]
we don't have much say but
okay [lah] I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people [lah]

ish

meeting #tini# was just like a coincidence thing cause she <malay>dia dia kerja dekat</malay> the hostel <malay>kat mana ni</malay> clarke quay then I was working <malay>kat lima</malay> [pe]
on that day
so I I know that #tini# has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like [eh] babe come [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] like

jas was there with us <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] no [lah] nothing <malay>dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay> that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like <malay>macam</malay> [orh] this jas guy is nice <malay>memang</malay> he he he is a very <malay>lepak</malay> guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with #tini# cause we asked #tini# face to face so all these while when #tini# like when we when me and her hung out [ah] like she like [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> #bali# this happened and then he give me all these
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
<malay>tini macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal</malay> sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking <malay>dia dia lupa</malay> [pe] [sial] <malay>kita</malay> like in a group ya correct then (um) like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just <malay>diam</malay> I just cause she she
[ah] she was just basically <malay>macam</malay> member [lah] [eh] jas <malay>gini gini gini</malay> I don't know I have [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know commitment issues #tini# like of course [lah] [kan] <malay>dia dengan dia punya</malay> commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know [ah] this happen and then she's like [oh] jas told me <malay>dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia</malay> after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah !hey! cause <malay>dia lupa</malay> [sia] correct then I
when I hear all these things from #tini# I'm like bullshit bullshit [sial] [lah] <malay>dia ni puki betul budak</malay>
so at some point no we hung out <malay>kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar sabar</malay> so
at at some point #tini# said this sentence (um) jas <malay>cakap dengan aku</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I never felt like this for a girl before <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told #tini#
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then #tini# just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah <malay>hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan</malay> sarah babe
pizza
so sarah
<malay>tak</malay>
no she and I and I told #tini# #tini#
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> then at at some point I told sarah sarah
(um) this #tini# and then sarah went ballistic already [ah] cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
cause what me and #azmi# told her was that actually jas and <malay>tini tak ada apa-apa</malay> but when we were there <malay>memang</malay> they really like
they they told me to they told to our face [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay>
ya jas <malay>dengan tini</malay> and then when we left back when me and #azmi# left first then they stay in #bali# apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her [lah]
[ah] so <malay>dia masih dia dia fikir dia</malay> casanova this guy <malay>sana</malay> like that so (um)
she just went her <malay>minah</malay> [lah] she did became the <malay>minah</malay>
(err) <malay>dia salahkan</malay> jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so [ah] ya then then that night happened and
no #tini# didn't want to talk [what]
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause [oh] maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
ya then I'm like <malay>kau nak pergi berbual dengan</malay> sarah <malay>buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan</malay> jas I say like that <malay>dia yang buat</malay> problem [pe] like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to #tini# which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with (err) sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and <malay>dekat rumah dia dekat yang</malay> #percil# <malay>tu</malay> [ah] we we <malay>lepak</malay> we hung out
(um) and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to [ah] she she said that
[ah] I am what was the word she used (um) <malay>macam berbual belakang dia</malay> [ah] like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole (um)
(err) bash thing
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like <malay>aku</malay> rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask #azmi# you can ask #nisa# or whoever was there at your birthday [lah] that was your birthday right my intention was really [eh] sarah this this happened to sarah okay <malay>sekarang</malay> like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and #azmi# in confident and I go out <malay>macam</malay> to her <malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> #lan jiao wei# <malay>pasal dia</malay> babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could [ah] tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation [ah] what I <malay>macam</malay> [ah] what I [ah] take from it is that [ah] sarah and sarah is <malay>dia</malay> always <malay>takut</malay> (err) she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel [lah] this is just my personal
(um) <malay>macam</malay> (um) how to say [eh] <malay>macam</malay> (um)
no no no like <malay>macam dia jaga</malay> conduct
like like her way her her image is <malay>dia nak kena jaga</malay> conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one [ah] [ah] I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not <malay>nangis</malay> to #azmi# but <malay>macam</malay> I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told #azmi# that I I I I know this is my <malay>niat</malay> but sometimes <malay>kadang-kadang niat baik</malay> but (um) you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
from then onwards I I <malay>macam</malay> I [ah] back off sort a little bit to really
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya ya correct cause correct #tini# told me ya sorry #tini# #tini# told me that (um) <malay>macam</malay> I've I don't open up to guys [one] like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she <malay>senyap</malay> this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
(um) like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the #laksa# thing we were having I was pissed off [lah] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you <malay>macam nak buat</malay> [sial] <malay>kat kau</malay> you know but
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> even though for months you been [eh] come [ah] we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
#nisa# did #nisa# did
[eh] #nisa# did and then I I put also [eh] #tini# we miss you [ah] we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that [what]
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
<malay>kau cakap dengan aku pasal</malay> something I don't go to <malay>ni</malay>
I I will never do things like that
[ah] no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my <malay>macam</malay> (um) my intentions to [ah]
hurt
we and it for us like sometimes [oh] we talk about <malay>tini macam gini</malay>
but gossip is <malay>kau tahu dia ni</malay>
ya
ya right ya
so ya [lah]
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
(um) in our <malay>macam</malay> friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
[ah] <malay>hati dia</malay> like she wants to <malay>jaga</malay> her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
[eh] <malay>bilang aku bilang aku</malay> you know
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya

but (err) we we wrote letters to each other right cause <malay>dulu tak ada tak ada</malay> social media
this was like secondary school and (um) he gave me his phone numbers and then we talk on the phone so we've been talking on the phone
and then suddenly some girl
(err)
apparently that he was dating was not happy that I was talking to him
and he [oh] my god we so #minahrep# babe and she talk to me on the phone one time she answered the phone call and talk to me and she was like
(err) like

but #marsiling# got port there [what] #marsiling# is
they even until now is notorious man when I was working with real life stories right
cause the borders is just right beside that that rental flat
there is this yes so you can actually see the the sea
the border
that that ya that that there's a causeway so apparently (um) all these people taking drugs or trying to get in to singapore in and out illegally
it's there so if you if you like that time when I went to see one of my clients there [lah] (err)
I <malay>jalan</malay> and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> you can see from their face <malay>macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini</malay> so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down <malay>tangga</malay> saw me
and then <malay>dia macam</malay> stop in the middle of <malay>tangga</malay> then I'm like (uh) <malay>turun</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
then she like he like look at me but I think he he suss me out okay okay this one like okay right then he like walk he walk also he like
trying to see what I'm doing there but then so that was the first time so the second time I I make sure to like I have some files in my hand and
so to make it look like a social work here like like a social worker I was there to do to do work to see all my clients right
so I'm like ya but like it's notorious then like my my boss like #salimah# [lah] I was saying that
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like <malay>macam</malay> old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing [ah] ya so like that

my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me <malay>macam</malay> cause
their their eyes is like <malay>apa kau buat kat sini</malay> so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
(um) books

let us know what we can help how we can help so we go there we like ya this is how rented house in singapore looks like and they look to be honest
this group of boys <malay>tak ada</malay> judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
I I feel like my generation in the late twenties early thirties there are there's a judgemental state
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] this is so interesting
ya
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like <malay>boleh duduk diam</malay> like what <malay>sepuluh minit lima belas minit</malay>
but after that if they want to go down they want to <malay>lepak</malay> so they bring this boy to the playground <malay>main</malay> catching babe

[oh] I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
<malay>macam main bawah blok</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay> bro
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david #moyes# you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when #thiago# was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
[eh] anyway <malay>sekarang</malay> david #moyes# <malay>kat mana</malay> [siol]
[ah]
[oh] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> manage west ham [oh] west ham [eh] [ah] how did west ham do in their [oh] they lost against new castle
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games [ah]
am I right okay never mind (err) who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch [tau] it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw #thiago# go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
and you know we we've got these we've got these <malay>dia macam kau macam</malay> you just look at this guy
and you're like okay <malay>dah</malay> settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
(mm)
okay
(uh huh)
that philosophy [ah]
okay
the same louis #van gaal# were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
(mmhmm)

(mmhmm)
okay
so that's why #mourinho# <malay>selalunya dia nya</malay> team (err) their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
I see

I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
(err) I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically (err) [ah] I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
(err) so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated (err) Netflix show
I I like what Netflix does these days [eh] <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
okay but anyway (err)
[sial] [lah] bro that [one] <malay>macam</malay> for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
<malay>kau</malay> #zuleika# #zulkifli# actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix [lah] cause
what happened was (uh) when september now [eh] so last month (err)
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
(err) I was like okay [lah] feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
!hey! there's this #anelka# documentary on Netflix
[ah] have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this #anelka# documentary [ah] so so it's (uh) it's a
tell all documentary [ah] an #anelka# and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything <malay>macam</malay> basically
<malay>aku rasa nama dia macam gitu</malay> [ah] I mean he's muslim name is supposedly #bilal# but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
like one was the the france <malay>punya</malay>
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause (err)
raymond dominic actually like (uh) had a an argument with #anelka#
and <malay>macam pada</malay> #anelka# it was not fair [ah] like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
I got into Netflix cause of that #anelka# documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows [lah] but some like (err) okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai [ah]
okay so so so basically <malay>macam</malay> I've watched cobra kai I've watched (err) I mean I don't tend to watch the series [ah] I would watch like documentaries or <malay>macam</malay> movies [ah] so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting [ah]
(err) social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now (uh) it's about how <malay>macam</malay> Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> basically
<malay>dorang tahu</malay> like what attracts you what what you're interested in (uh)
so <malay>dorang buat macam</malay> (uh) and if not an avatar they like what do you call it [lah]
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like [oh] they sell the data
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like <malay>macam</malay> they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why <malay>macam</malay> Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation [ah]
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
[sia] [ah] why do they think this way [sia] <malay>asal dorang fikir macam gitu</malay> like <malay>dia</malay>
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
(uh) am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
<malay>kau</malay> how can people just support [sia] <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya [lah] usually it's either very insidious thingy [ah]
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like [oh] you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting [lah] like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it [lah] so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and (err) it's about how this guy (err) I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder (err) ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you [lah] but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town [lah] that he's in
[ah] it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean [ah] okay [lah] so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places [ah] one is (err) knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america (uh)
(err) K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so [ah] basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like <malay>macam</malay> lost his faith a bit [lah] cause one of the themes of the movie
is (err) you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that [lah]
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so (uh) and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then (err) and then and then and then
after he has a son of his own he starts to <malay>macam</malay> go back to
like worshipping god [ah] no <malay>macam macam</malay> it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>orang beragama pun macam</malay>
<malay>kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu</malay> that sort of thing so <malay>macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang</malay> for like five years <malay>lepas tu dia macam</malay> [eh] #astgahfirullah# <malay>aku kena qadak balik solat aku</malay>
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
ya so so so that's a tragedy <malay>macam</malay> something happens and then after that he he has this <malay>macam</malay> love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story (err)
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted [ah] I mean in the movie they they they
[ah] not not just inner demons [ah] I mean they are just they are evil people [ah] you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is [ah] robert pattison
you know that twilight fella [lah] !huh! ya the glittery vampire so <malay>dia yang sekarang</malay>
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something [kan]
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but [eh] but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show [ah]
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie [ah]
[ah] well he doesn't he doesn't molest children [ah]
okay shouldn't stereotype (err) pastor <malay>dorang</malay>
[a'ah]
okay
are you sure you want to say this on (err) are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box [ah]
okay [lah] so it's an [lah] it's not the Android box <malay>yang</malay> Android box <malay>yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada</malay> [kan] <malay>tu benda</malay> [kan]
[oh] is it
so basically it's an [lah]
okay okay
[ah]
[oh] is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya [lah] they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five [ah] it's like not not even [ah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl [kan]
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
(mm)
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that (uh) they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no [lah]
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's (uh) not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
(err) groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans [lah]
no he was in house of cards and and (err) house of cards the final season just <malay>macam tergantung macam gitu apa</malay>
because of this [ah] so
so I mean like in singapore #dee kosh# obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening <malay>mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang</malay> cause of all the
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
religious upbringing to say like [eh] <malay>ni benda salah</malay> [sia] what am I doing you know that sort of thing so <malay>macam</malay> I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no [lah] no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like <malay>macam</malay> it won't have been like once every few months [ah] which is the situation you find it you find now [ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
alright
[oh] my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through [ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
he's he's a good kid [ah]
okay
[a'ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
okay
<malay>dia panggil kau</malay> sir but <malay>asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau</malay> [seh]
[oh] okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him [oh] you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya [lah] cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that #upskirtism#
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
so he actually did it
look [eh] look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates [ah] bro
check it out I I was wrong okay [lah] I mean I think I can tell this to the camera [eh] to the camera <malay>pula</malay> to the recorder okay I was from #serangoon# right
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name [ah] but but but I don't know but
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like <malay>ini</malay> #aizat# #adam# <malay>ni semua</malay> like [eh] ya [eh] [eh] you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school <malay>dulu</malay>
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude [lah] but but <malay>macam</malay>
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many (uh) malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you won't find a malay chap in the in that class [ah]
so basically he was in one of those classes [ah]
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him [lah] like I I remember of
his existence back this in [ah]
yes
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times <malay>nanti aku</malay> google <malay>aku</malay> check [kan] <malay>lepas tu aku aku aku</malay> forward <malay>dekat kau</malay> [lah]
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that (uh) inhibits our society [ah] but basically ya [lah] back to what we were saying <malay>macam aku rasa</malay> that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference <malay>apa betul tak</malay> like
ya <malay>macam</malay> one thing about us <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) compared to <malay>kita punya</malay> parents [eh] <malay>macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita</malay> tend to <malay>macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita</malay> you know like our parents <malay>aku rasa dorangnya</malay> generations is like <malay>kau kenal ni satu perempuan</malay>
within a few months <malay>tunang</malay> another few months <malay>kahwin</malay> you know that sort of thing
ya
what was that so so so you see [eh] <malay>macam</malay> what #ondre# said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different [ah] you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] it was a norm [ah] like [oh] your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay <malay>kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit</malay> or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants [ah] you know so <malay>macam</malay> like
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally [lah] cause he's from that country
<malay>orang</malay> pakistan <malay>kat sini</malay> will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now [ah] so maybe <malay>kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa</malay> then talk talk talk [eh] I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to [ah] but of course I mean
maybe I don't know [ah] maybe we're we're looking at it differently [lah] maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation [ah] from what I understand [lah]
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum [ah]
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that <malay>macam</malay> (err) #syed ahmad# was interested in your mother
sorry #syed ahmad# we didn't mean to mention your name
[oh] okay
[oh] okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
[ah] we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
(um) okay so what was that okay so basically <malay>macam</malay> ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing [ah] so <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>anak aku</malay>
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
ya
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya
I think girls these days they are like <malay>lagi beza dari kita macam</malay> in the sense that they are really pressured to
look and ya look and behave a certain way [ah] perhaps [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
well I mean what can you say [ah] these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on [ah]
and I guess people are just
following trends [ah] just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
susceptible to this [ah] <malay>macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa</malay> in a way [lah] but <malay>aku rasa untuk wanita ni</malay>
<malay>dorang lebih senang dipengaruh</malay> [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> [ah] [ah] like compared to guys [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife <malay>macam</malay>
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
[ah] <malay>kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah</malay> you know that sort of thinking you know
but now is like quite common [ah] you know nowadays you have mosque
where they provide a place for you to do the <malay>walimah</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] but you still had your your function in a activity hall [ah] my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
a still somewhat rare for the whole <malay>majlis</malay> from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like <malay>masjid mawaddah</malay>
(err) I mean there there are some !huh!
no but bartley is like <malay>macam</malay> bartley is is is so called not really
(err) subject to any of these trends I feel [lah]
you can [lah] you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
I'm trying to say is that <malay>macam</malay> nowadays you have instances where people do say like [eh] should we have our <malay>majlis</malay> in a mosque cause then like <malay>orang nak sembahyang</malay> and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding [what] you know in a way [lah] but of course
<malay>pada aku pun aku rasa macam</malay> if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a <malay>walimah</malay> a small <malay>walimah</malay> outside the mosque [ah]
ya
okay [ah] not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so <malay>macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam</malay> that was
something that that was on her mind like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] why are we doing it in the mosque <malay>abeh macam</malay> like [oh] I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
[eh] why you buying a three room flat [sia] it's so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure [ah] I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning [ah]
[ah]
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day you just have to be
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that [ah] you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house [lah] I don't know whether I told you
ya !huh! ya ya <malay>aku dah</malay> end of this month [eh] end of this month [eh] end of this year <malay>dah enam tahun</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak</malay> upgrade to <malay>macam</malay> five room <malay>ke</malay> [ah]
#sengkang# <malay>juga</malay>
bro bro #tampines# <malay>mahal</malay> bro #tampines# <malay>mahal gila</malay> no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> #abbas# <malay>nya</malay> parents <malay>aku</malay> #sengkang# <malay>apa</malay>
bro #sengkang# bro #raeesah khan#
[oh] sorry was that too loud jamus #lim#
(err) unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not #sengkang# but it's okay
no no this is #ang mo kio# so
basically basically okay basically basically #sengkang# right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale [lah] so for those people who don't know #sengkang# you know is divided into this so called <malay>macam</malay> four districts <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] so (err) anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this <malay>sungai</malay> [lah]
it's called the <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# I think [ah] so like if you look out my window here you can see the <malay>sungai</malay> [ah]
so that <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# (err) is the boundary between #sengkang# which is held by the workers' party and #ang mo kio# which is held by pinky work
[ah] sorry [ah] every conversation between #zulika# and myself must involve some degree of politics [lah] then you know there's some spice [ah]
so (uh) we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come (uh) we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good [ah] [ah]
I I don't want to play games [ah] I mean I think I would draw the line at games [ah]
ya
my wife my wife and I [oh] but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife [ah] okay
[a'ah]
okay
!wah!
that's a very productive (err) your time bro
[oh] okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad [eh] you you should talk
you should talk to my cousin #abbas# [ah] who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me [eh] <malay>kalau kau suka</malay> breaking bad <malay>kau kena</malay> watch this better call saul [lah]
so <malay>aku macam aku ada tengok</malay> [ah] like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while <malay>aku macam</malay> how many seasons are there [oh] my god breaking bad only has five seasons
[oh] my god okay
ya [lah] he hasn't changed his name yet [lah]
okay
yes yes yes yes
(uh)
okay
[ah]

and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see [oh] ya ya ya ya ya
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where <malay>abang dia yang</malay> very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
(err) so I think his brother died or something [eh]
okay I I think roughly around at that point <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them [ah] okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
[kan] there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle <malay>dia macam terus</malay> didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya [lah] but he kept on <malay>macam</malay> like downplaying <malay>si</malay> jimmy <malay>nya</malay> achievement [ah] <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing [kan]
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago [sia]
okay
!huh!
I I've never watch game of thrones [ah] by the way
and the witcher <malay>ke apa</malay> witcher witcher <malay>pun aku tak tengok sangat</malay>
of course [ah] bro ya
there was a prison break movie
[eh] prison break <malay>si dia tu dah mati</malay> [kan] the actual <malay>dah mati</malay> [kan] the guy who plays michael scofield [lah]
yes he died right
okay let me google this michael scofield <malay>mati</malay>
wentworth miller
[oh] okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me [ah] no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true [ah]
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it [oh] ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
so is season five good or not <malay>dorang ada tulis</malay> prison break season six <malay>lagi tak</malay> [ah]
[oh] my god I I thought this was over [sia] bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
the movie was not on the <malay>ni ni</malay> [kan] the movie was on <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] only the final break
shucks [ah] #ikram# stop getting me hooked back on all this crap [lah] <malay>malas</malay> [sial] <malay>nak pergi tengok ni semua</malay>
[ah]
[oh] my god stop [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[a'ah]
[sial] [lah] bro you could have read all the books [seh] in all that time [sia] bro
[oh] I heard of that but I didn't watch it
<malay>aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> once I see <malay>macam satu benda ni ada</malay> four five seasons [kan]
<malay>aku terus lemah</malay> [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> no [lah] I cannot watch this [sia]
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that (err) I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently [lah] so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys [lah] so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
!hey! siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass <malay>punya</malay> app
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
[ah] all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful [lah] I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
mine is after iPhone eight [lah] basically <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] so so so it's one of those things that I don't know [ah] Apple fan boys are talking about these days [ah]
double double tap then the code <malay>keluar</malay>
the scanner the scanner the scanner <malay>keluar</malay> not the code the camera thingy ya
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
it automatically scans the code [oh] okay
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code [ah] <malay>macam ni kau tengok</malay> <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
no no no that's that's if you can [lah] <malay>kat bawah tu</malay> [kan]
then it goes <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
there <malay>kat bawah kat bawah sini</malay>
it goes in a anti clockwise [eh] clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this <malay>dia macam</malay> go
like that
so (uh) #inshallah# with [ah] I also reciting <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> we will get our twenty dollars and (err) we can spend it on a steak later at #jalan kayu#
[eh] so so so (err) we're coming to the end
shall we talk about our favourite <malay>makan</malay> places since it's almost lunch
<malay>tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I've never heard of it being described as a good place [lah]
okay
babe <malay>aku pun aku pun</malay> I know I know (err) anchorvale
<malay>dorang ada</malay> the vending machine cafe [ah] if that's what you are referring to
[oh] I think I know what your day is referring to
the <malay>yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung</malay>
yes so <malay>yassin kampung</malay> they have this off shoot called <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot <malay>lepak</malay> one corner it it doesn't feel like the <malay>lepak</malay> place [ah] it feels like you just go in <malay>kau beli makan dekat</malay> no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
[ah] both [ah]
okay ya good joke but [ah] so then <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia macam tempat makan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay <malay>kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam</malay> queue up <malay>dekat</malay> the stall [ah] so it's like a hawker stall [ah] it's like a hawker centre
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like <malay>abeh kau kena pergi sana</malay> order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that <malay>makanan dia</malay> okay [lah] not bad [lah] but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> so so <malay>juga</malay> but it doesn't have the <malay>lepak</malay> feeling [lah]
because like <malay>pada aku lepak</malay> feeling <malay>macam kau kau duduk</malay> then like [eh] #bhai# <malay>teh tarik lagi satu</malay> [ah] [eh] if you want to go place you should go to #mahamoodiya#

(uh huh)
I mean it will get better [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni semua bukan</malay> like forever [what] they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's true
I don't know
I mean
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on <malay>cari kerja ke</malay> start business <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kau nak buat</malay> business <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but <malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau masih beli benda kat</malay> habbo
(mm) <malay>masih</malay> spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like <malay>jual</malay> your <malay>benda</malay> and quit or
(mm)
<malay>banyak sangat benda</malay> [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> remove <malay>banyak benda</malay> from the game then <malay>orang semua macam tak nak main</malay>
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
I think <malay>dia orang macam tak fikir</malay> they gonna cause
<malay>macam</malay> like to them at the end of the day <malay>kita</malay> like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
<malay>macam</malay> like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then <malay>orang masih beli</malay> [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
<malay>habis</malay> smite <malay>apa jadi</malay>
ya
[oh] really cause I know that day (uh) <malay>siapa naim</malay> asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya <malay>macam</malay>
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> download then <malay>sampai dia</malay> have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] <malay>ilyas dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like [oh] I cannot play with you cause <malay>sekarang dia main</malay> among us [jer]
ya
I think <malay>baru</malay> [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> delete <malay>semua benda tinggal yang</malay> programme files
like <malay>dia</malay> basically formatted his ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
<malay>dia cakap dulu</malay> file <malay>dia macam</malay> fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen <malay>lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu</malay>
it's probably him ya
I don't know [sia]
cause that time <malay>dia cakap dia punya</malay> app <malay>ada</malay> issue [lah] he couldn't log in so <malay>dia</malay> delete then <malay>bila dia nak</malay> redownload <malay>balik tak boleh</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> format like remove everything from <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>lepas tu semua benda</malay> like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
[oh] ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want [sia]
I don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine <malay>yang</malay> character character <malay>dia semua jadi</malay> spongebob <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>macam</malay> mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but I mean <malay>pasal kalau</malay>
<malay>badan sapau pun</malay> I mean you can just go to the gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that <malay>tapi kalau nak muka baru</malay> I mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya I guess <malay>banyak banyak duit</malay> at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like <malay>kalau nak</malay> like make yourself fitter and stuff <malay>boleh pergi lari</malay> and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
I mean to a certain extent <malay>semua orang pun macam</malay> at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but <malay>kalau</malay>
no any other day (hmm)
<malay>kalau ni hari</malay> not much [lah] I'm just going to go home and like rest but like <malay>kalau esok</malay> maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
<malay>nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang</malay> haven't <malay>dah lama belum potong rambut</malay> so maybe I shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
I don't know I
<malay>rasa macam</malay> free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
<malay>sekarang muka macam</malay> maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short <malay>macam</malay> medium length <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak panjang sangat pun</malay>
but ya
<malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> (hmm)
netflix <malay>lepas tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> and playing a bit of
(um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no I haven't played cause like I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>main dengan naim</malay> and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so I usually <malay>kalau dia orang dua</malay> [jer] then I I avoid
but like <malay>kalau</malay> the rest <malay>main</malay> then <malay>aku main</malay> [ah] cause I
!huh! really I didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] I didn't see
I didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
I mean the same thing happened <malay>bila</malay> that time I tried to download <malay>kat</malay> my macbook <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang</malay>
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
cause I don't think they have a <malay>punya</malay> file
ya
(mm)
<malay>satu benda</malay>
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
[oh] ya <malay>kalau satu benda dapat rumah</malay> [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
[kan]
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
<malay>kau nak beli rumah punya susah</malay>
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah</malay> then at most <malay>kau kerja untuk</malay>
maybe your savings and then like <malay>sikit untuk makan minum</malay> bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
I guess
I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island <malay>yang tak ada orang</malay>
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
<malay>hantu</malay>
so what the cow is the <malay>hantu</malay> or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
maybe <malay>orang</malay> maybe like someone like <malay>dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa</malay>
<malay>macam buang kat sana kesian</malay>
<malay>dia lari</malay>
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
I mean the
the latest the one I think just got removed what the <malay>kampung</malay>
I mean there's still one that exists that like
I don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual <malay>kampung macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu</malay> ya
<malay>yang</malay> that time I went there <malay>untuk yang satu</malay> filming for this
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [ah]
ya went there and then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>tempat tu memang ada benda</malay> [ah] like there's there's actual <malay>hantu</malay> living there ya
and then like there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
<malay>abeh dia orang cakap macam</malay> (um) like <malay>kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam</malay> have like
good intentions like you can't be there to <malay>macam</malay>
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like <malay>kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur</malay> [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from I think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the <malay>hantu</malay> was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her <malay>punya</malay> costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the <malay>hantu</malay> it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] she's like I think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
<malay>abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu</malay> and then it's kind of fun [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal <malay>yang kecil punya</malay> contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
<malay>benda tu jadi</malay> so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only <malay>kampung</malay> I know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that <malay>kampung</malay>
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there <malay>kita nampak macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay> caucasian people #ang moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
they were like <malay>dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang nampak</malay> then <malay>kita punya</malay> filming <malay>punya benda</malay> then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and <malay>jalan</malay>
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of <malay>kampung</malay> houses [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> maybe <malay>ada lima ke enam orang</malay> [jer] <malay>tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang</malay> [ah]
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that <malay>kampung</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like <malay>ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam</malay> I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like <malay>macam kalau</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> like here and then it's just <malay>kat bawah</malay>
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the <malay>kampung</malay> area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
<malay>besar juga</malay> [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all <malay>kayu</malay> and then like very old school [lah] <malay>semua macam</malay>
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the <malay>kampung</malay>
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
ya it's quite <malay>gelap</malay> I mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tempat dia memang besar</malay> like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause <malay>bila kita masuk kita naik</malay> lorry <malay>kena bawa semua</malay> equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
<malay>aku datang</malay> just <malay>tengok-tengok abeh</malay> like <malay>macam tolong sini tolong sana</malay>
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya <malay>dah pukul lapan gitu</malay> then she came over
then she was like <malay>kau orang nampak apa-apa tak</malay> and I'm like (um) no and then she said like <malay>kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut</malay> nothing [one]
<malay>dia hantu baik</malay> then I'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will <malay>tunggu malam baru keluar</malay> cause <malay>panas sangat</malay> like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
<malay>tiga tahun</malay> [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like <malay>kesian juga</malay> [ah] like you when you <malay>tengok</malay> the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
I want go <malay>yang tempat apa tu yang dekat</malay> gardens by the bay [ah]
<malay>pergi satu kali</malay> [ah] when in maybe secondary school
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
(uh) five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
<malay>tiga</malay> wish
(hmm)
that's a hard question
<malay>aku nak rumah</malay>
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
<malay>entah abeh</malay>
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> free <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau bayar</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>aku bingit</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> free
then collect <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dekat rumah aku</malay> okay [lah] and
I mean ya <malay>memang</malay> [ah] like <malay>buang masa juga</malay> cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing <malay>abeh</malay> it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but I don't think <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
I just I cannot imagine like
<malay>tak suka</malay>
[oh]
I was like !huh!
ya
<malay>kat bawah</malay> block
!huh! <malay>sini takde banyak kucing</malay>
[oh] that's weird
the hell
only got <malay>lembu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
have you seen your cat <malay>luar</malay>
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
<malay>seram</malay> [sia]
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
(mm)
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) <malay>bila</malay> like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
<malay>abeh batuk rabak</malay> [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
<malay>sekarang</malay> if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then <malay>kalau</malay> when I <malay>mandi</malay> him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
I mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine [lah] like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to <malay>macam</malay> pursue technology
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
the president speaks in malay <malay>kau orang semua</malay> stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think <malay>kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi</malay> I just I just want to give you a warning [eh] <malay>kau</malay> stop [jer] [eh] <malay>jangan buat lagi</malay> [tau]
then okay <malay>kau balik</malay> like
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
[oh] well
ya [sia] and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical [sia] like how
why
(mmhmm)
are we
bye bye

okay testing
okay [lah] can [lah]
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of (um) hitting the red waves
yeah
[ah] but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements [ah]
take this as a the centre marking [ah]
so how was your prep
<malay>tadi lambat lagi</malay> [oh]
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like [ah] (um) what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but what what was the instructor's comments
(mm)
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money [ah]
it's the same bike
(mm)
E brake [eh]
<malay>hujung sini punya</malay> side [ah]
[oh] okay okay ya [ha] ya it's there [ah] okay wait it was on the straight road
[oh] corner <malay>yang</malay> third corner
ya there's one mirror there
ya
(mm)
<malay>takde bunyi</malay>
behind [ah]
[oh] okay
secluded [ah]
okay
(um)
of course [lah]
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
wait you went you you stop to help her
[oh] the instructor went to help her
ya [lah] I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
[oh] she
ya correct ya
(mm)
(mm)
what so she crashed into the wall
skid [ah]
by point of time you stop [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
kill switch
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>siapa</malay> number one
[oh] you get you got number one [ah]
(mm)
bandana
<malay>ada muka macam mat salleh sikit takde</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
the other side [ah]
then
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
but he was in charge of your class [ah]
prac one also [lah]
[oh] okay
(hmm)
no [lah] maybe maybe they they want you to practise more [ah] before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no [lah] some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> two B
people who are riding class <malay>tu</malay> steady <malay>jatuh</malay> plank I have issues with plank I cannot hit the timing
class two ten seconds
!huh! class two class two class two ten second slower with a heavy bike <malay>aku punya</malay> timing <malay>selalu</malay> nine point seven nine nine point eight <malay>habis kat aku kena</malay> four points <malay>aku</malay> short [siol]
seven seconds is fast [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> class <malay>tu</malay> you have to go ten second <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh]
okay [lah] I mean with practice you can [ah]
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already [ha]
gear gear one <malay>kau boleh</malay> reach thirty
<malay>kalau kau</malay> whack [ah]
<malay>ini kau</malay> vroom <malay>dah pergi</malay> [siol]
that's how fast a class two bike is [ah]
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly [ah]
highly harly can bobber [ah] you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive [lah] [sia] (uh) I I I tested the bike (um)
I think last year during (uh)
wicked wallop <malay>tu dia orang baru</malay> just started (um) this company called mutt motorcycles [lah] I mean it's it's quite a renown brand in in their own country but it's new in singapore
so when they they they open up their their booth
a lot of interested <malay>punya</malay>
people [lah] so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay> two fifty like what's the purpose of you riding a two fifty [kan] either three hundred or four hundred [lah] [kan]
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean the the bike is
whatever what you see is what you get [lah]
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
the only ones that I know is vicious cycle <malay>ada satu dekat</malay> woodlands
(uh) #sanju#
#kaki bukit# #sanfu# #sanfu#
(uh) and I think the
ya and they have a showroom <malay>dekat</malay> #paya lebar#
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven [ah] seventeen K
[eh] sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
inclusive of [ah] back then that was last year <malay>punya</malay> so imagine with this year's
four K
four plus [ah]
expensive [ah]
definitely way cheaper [lah] I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean (uh) zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike [ah] brixton
but of course [lah] mutt is mutt is
I mean way better [lah]
<malay>aku</malay> actually try <malay>apa</malay> when I went to wicked wallop <malay>aku tanya dia</malay>
[eh] (um) if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
[oh] I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
(uh) brixton is is is a europe bike [ah]
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
then <malay>bila aku fikir-fikir balik</malay> (uh) forget it [ah] I'm taking my class two
waste <malay>duit</malay> [sial] <malay>nanti dah beli lepas tu aku dapat</malay> class two upgrade <malay>lagi</malay> don't want [ah]
but my wife tell me [ah] cause I keep falling <malay>apa</malay> I keep failing my class two and then every single time I take my class two prac
<malay>aku jatuh</malay>
my wife <malay>cakap</malay>
(um)
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money [ah]
you upgrade
(mm)
[ah] [lah] of course [lah] of course [lah]
no [lah] I mean I'm looking at my options
why [ah]
ya but super four is (uh) quite reliable bike [ah]
it is
ya no problem
ya but theirs they they it's not four hundred yes it's five hundred [eh] I mean because of singapore <malay>punya</malay> (uh) limitations and stuff so they
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> two A [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> higher [lah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
but the one thing about super four
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> their maintenance
it's freaking expensive [ah] [sial]
for a normal two B bike [ah] okay at the max you can go is one and a half engine oil bottles I mean we don't we don't talk about class two bikes [ah] class two <malay>memang</malay> of course [lah] the maintenance the servicing is going to cost you a bomb talking about standard two A bikes or two B bikes
my my bike one bottle that means one litre [lah] so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no [lah] one month [ah] I mean right now COVID one month [ah]
back then [eh] no [lah] back then when I was working in (uh)
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
to and fro [ah] twenty eight <malay>pergi</malay> twenty eight <malay>balik</malay>
fifty six [lah] <malay>kau masuk sikit-sikit</malay> if you know <malay>jalan jauh sikit</malay> then sixty [ah]
that it took me about one month [ah] to to to reach two click two thousand click
!walao! if two weeks two weeks <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] [sia] ya [lah] ya ya
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need [ah]
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay [lah] harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
!siala! <malay>kau</malay> imagine
four bottles of okay [lah] let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
(uh) quality <malay>punya</malay> engine oil okay [lah] basic [ah] ya basic motul [ah]
motul (uh) ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs [ah]
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> iridium spark plugs [ah]
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's about what forty eight plus hundred bucks hundred and forty eight dollars that is just every one month monthly <malay>punya</malay> servicing you know
then <malay>tak termasuk kau punya tayar kau punya</malay> wear and tear <malay>kau punya</malay> brake pad
<malay>kau punya</malay> coolant super four <malay>ada</malay> coolant [kan]
that's why [lah] I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] I'm I'm too short [ah]
like what
three ten is quite big [ah] [sia] <malay>aku dah</malay>
is it
it's nice [lah] I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
it's it's a cafe racer <malay>punya</malay> model [eh]
capacity
(mm)
[oh]
ya [lah] and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper [ah]
no the furthest I went with this bike was (um) #desaru#
the furthest I went with my was (uh) #muar#
ya ya [lah]
(um)
three hundred it depends on where you are if I think about six hundred <malay>ke</malay> four five hundred <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] but
I've heard my I mean my friends [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> case <malay>dah</malay> on the [eh] <malay>dah dah pergi</malay> on the way <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston seize
tow [ah]
if <malay>dia orang</malay> if <malay>kena</malay> those people <malay>yang sengkek</malay> those who don't have money
they will go for the
the dangerous way [ah]
which is to <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tahu tolak macam mana</malay> [kan]
this one I I never tried [ah] I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you [ah]
so you've lift down your foot rest
your <malay>dia punya</malay> pillion foot rest
my left leg
will <malay>tolak</malay> your bike I will I will use my bike <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) power to push together
[ah]
[ha] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] I've seen on the road [sia] serious I've seen it on the road [eh] <malay>au tak pernah nampak</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay> I've seen it on the road so that one if if you get caught by in singapore both revoke
but I mean malaysia <malay>dia orang kisah apa</malay>
[eh]
don't talk about #negeri sembilan# benny <malay>yang</malay> deliver <malay>dulu</malay>
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders [ah]
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
<malay>dia keluarkan</malay> so his was under run in running in
so technically his engine <malay>dah baru tukar</malay> overhaul [lah]
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or (uh) a new overhauled engine
(um)
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
ya so your has to be less than seven [ha] <malay>jaga</malay> correct
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike [lah]
so this guy
<malay>dia sorang</malay> two B
the rest was all two A class two no <malay>dia ikut</malay> [siol] he was going at one twenty !wah! <malay>pergi boleh pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>pergi</malay> happy happy
<malay>main</malay> go cart <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston <malay>pupus</malay> [ah]
benny <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] benny then swap [ah] <malay>tukar-tukar</malay>
that was from #malacca# to <malay>dia orang tolak</malay>
no [lah] [sial] they were going a hundred plus <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [sial]
I mean the person <malay>yang motor mati tu</malay> was just relax [jer] [ah]
steer [lah] but if <malay>kalau kau kena</malay> those sticky situations [ah]
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
<malay>kereta kat depan</malay>
jammed brake
<malay>kau tengah tolak</malay> [siol]
brake brake [ah] <malay>habis kalau</malay> case <malay>yang</malay> I don't know [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] because <malay>kau punya motor mati kau tak boleh</malay> engine break <malay>kau nak</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> gear down
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral [lah]
<malay>kau tak pernah tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay>
speaking of bike accidents
(uh) my father's friend [ah]
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga</malay> [ah]
<malay>dia bawa yang apa</malay> wolf [eh] wolf
eagle is it
I don't know [ah] it's a it's an old bike [lah] <malay>aku rasa sekarang pun dah tak ada</malay>
and then I think he was riding an
and then <malay>ada</malay> <malay>dua ke apa</malay> I can't remember [ah]
so they went to #pasir gudang# to to track [ah] <malay>main</malay> track
so <malay>dia orang nak main</malay> [ah] <malay>kira dah puas</malay>
<malay>balik punya</malay> time
<malay>dah sampai</malay> singapore
so one of the one of the friend <malay>dia tengah</malay> pillion <malay>orang</malay>
pillion <malay>tidur</malay>
he was sleeping and then of course [lah] #pasir gudang# quite far [lah] <malay>kau nak main</malay> track <malay>semua</malay> it's it's quite tiring [ah]
so this the rider
<malay>dia tak tahu</malay> [tau] the pillion was sleeping
he went to <malay>selit</malay> in between truck two trucks of course <malay>kau punya kau</malay> wobbly [ah] the pillion <malay>jatuh masuk dalam lori</malay> [siol]
my father witnessed his friend died [lah] [sia]
guy <malay>dia dia punya</malay> parents all like blame whoever it was there [lah] [sia] members [ah] <malay>kira</malay> [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>kita main</malay> track you know that kind of thing [dah] happy happy <malay>balik mati</malay>
<malay>bujang</malay> [ah]
<malay>cakap pasal</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) accidents sean
sean sean sean fan sean fan [ha] liner he used to have two B [what] he also witnessed his friend died (um) they all going to <malay>tu dia pun mat rempit juga</malay> [ah] <malay>bawa</malay>
so so
before this guy died [ah] he told me [lah] then he was very different
<malay>dia dah minta maaf dekat semua orang</malay>
[eh] you know forgive me [ah] if I ever sinned towards you [ah]
so on that day they went to
I think this guy <malay>tertidur ke apa entah</malay> either <malay>tertidur</malay> I don't know the full I forgot the full story he told me the story but I can't remember
but same case [ah] he went under the truck
<malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> shagged [ah]
<malay>habis kadang-kadang</malay> people will think [ah] then if I don't ride then whose my bike how
it's dangerous [ah]
[oh] speaking of dangerous riding [kan] I think one of their simulation lessons [kan]
they will simulate
you drunk
and how is it gonna look like [oh] you you <malay>belum lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>belum pergi</malay> [eh]
but it's damn stupid [ah] [sial]
no pass no fail
so you riding so the thing was like <malay>gini gini gini</malay>
is just car just swerve in front of you
<malay>aku</malay> brake <malay>tak makan</malay> [sia] brake <malay>tak makan langgar</malay> [ah] error you have met into an accident <malay>kepala otak</malay>
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can [ah] but then it's stupid [ah]
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike [ah]
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
<malay>tapi</malay> when (uh)
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
<malay>kau kena</malay> watch out
(um) because <malay>dia punya</malay> platform so you have to climb up this platform and the bike is there so ya three screens
so <malay>dia punya</malay> the foot rest and the platform so the motor <malay>boleh gini</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kalau kau terpijak</malay> on the wrong platform <malay>kau boleh jatuh</malay> gear <malay>kau boleh jatuh</malay> [sial] <malay>kau macam</malay> lost balance [ah] if your if your <malay>kalau kau</malay> if you have slow reaction then you'll fall [lah]
but <malay>kalau kau jatuh tinggi</malay> [sial] <malay>tu</malay> platform
can
look <malay>benda tu</malay> like imagine the bike <malay>dia dia kira sebab</malay> bike <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>gitu tapi</malay> the bike won't fall
but you will hold the bike [ah] no need no need no need
<malay>tapi</malay> the the car simulation <malay>dia punya</malay> instructor
I would say <malay>dia orang</malay> #siao# on [ah]
<malay>kena maki</malay> [siol] [eh] hello
you driving in india is it
this international [ah] the driving cause they will tell you okay (uh) in two hundred meters turn left it's like [ah] this guy went straight <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
[eh] hello you drive like this in india is it <malay>kuat</malay> [sia] <malay>dia berbual aku dah aku dah aku dah tapi sebelah aku</malay> india <malay>depan aku pun</malay> india <malay>boleh cakap gitu</malay> [sial] #dol#

(mmhmm)
because because I mean how I find out was I shared with her a lot of things she go and #pao#
there are things I didn't like about the the whole how they

hello hi how are you I <malay>nak minta tolong sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh tak</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] my parents <malay>nak makan nasi padang</malay> [ah] but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best <malay>nasi padang</malay> in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> you know but other than that cause <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> I went went there just now today they're not open
ya I don't know why I've no idea [lah] so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
(mm) <malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah]
I mean we are going there [lah] but you have a recommendation where
I think I think I know I think I know <malay>yang mana satu</malay> we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried <malay>sana sedap</malay> [eh]
[oh] is that type [lah] I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that <malay>kena</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>sebelas</malay> this is for lunch [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>nasi padang</malay> I think the most of the places <malay>jarang</malay> [ah] [eh] I think but there's one place I don't know you <malay>pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia</malay> I think it's called <malay>sari ratu</malay> you <malay>pernah pergi sana buka</malay> I think like <malay>pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka</malay> [tau]
I actually have no idea but I <malay>pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu</malay>
<malay>dia punya lauk masih</malay> still looks fresh [lah] <malay>tak tak rasa macam</malay>
since <malay>pagi ke apa</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang masak petang juga</malay> but okay [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> in case you <malay>keluar dengan</malay> your family or your friends
<malay>tekak</malay> you <malay>nak makan nasi padang</malay> you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road [lah] but it's it's quite near the #kampong glam# area like #baghdad# street or something like that
[oh]
[oh] <malay>apa nama tempat dia</malay> [eh]
[oh]
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall <malay>kalau pergi sana</malay> I think
okay [lah] I think I will try that that what <malay>minang</malay> place there
(mm)
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing (err) my parents <malay>dia orang nak makan sana</malay> cause just nice [lah] think after that I <malay>boleh ke nak jalan</malay> around the area <malay>beli kain-kain ke apa-apa</malay>
that that area got a lot of <malay>kedai-kedai macam gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>jual kain</malay> [lah] <malay>jual buku-buku</malay> [lah] <malay>jual baju</malay> [lah] carpet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>belum ada</malay> plan but around that area got a few malls [kan]
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
for the house I don't know like <malay>pinggan mangkuk ke apa</malay> think whatever ya [lah]
<malay>dia orang nak beli</malay> I think <malay>nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak</malay> I think can bring to think #bugis# junction quite near
(mm) or any of the malls around there [lah]
ya
ya [lah] I think everywhere [lah] the same but now if possible <malay>duduk rumah</malay> more ya cause if you have to go out also <malay>yang</malay> no choice then <malay>kalau nak keluar</malay> you buy whatever you need to buy you <malay>beli dah beli dah makan ke apa</malay> then <malay>terus balik</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin</malay>
how to say that frustrating like you said [lah] take out handphone take take the
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now <malay>banyak orang buat gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa</malay> you <malay>nak beli kadang-kadang</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> online you <malay>tengok</malay> colour <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>nanti datang</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kita kita boleh hantar balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> refund <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! ya [lah] and <malay>gambar</malay> you <malay>tak boleh</malay> cannot
trust <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
(mm)
then in the end what happened did you <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>nasi</malay> [jer]
[oh]
I think I think got <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I <malay>dengar</malay> complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
<malay>untuk</malay> self pick up you know you order then you <malay>pergi sana sendiri</malay> you you you
you pick up the food <malay>sendiri</malay> then I order at first they say the food should be ready <malay>dua puluh minit</malay> then I [dah] <malay>sampai sana</malay> I <malay>tunggu</malay> almost one hour <malay>baru</malay> the food <malay>siap</malay>
that time (mm) ya
ya [lah] that one is
that one <malay>lagi</malay> self pick up <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>tunggu dia</malay> delivery I think <malay>mungkin</malay> more than one hour but this was back then [lah] during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think <malay>semua orang</malay> order
<malay>pernah</malay> order grab <malay>takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah</malay> [kan]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> order <malay>tunggu satu jam</malay> ya [lah] that time I I <malay>ada satu</malay> friend <malay>pun dia ceritakan dia</malay> order I think (err) mothers' day I think
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> order <malay>pun dia</malay> order (err)
<malay>dia dah</malay> order <malay>tunggu lama-lama</malay> the <malay>punya</malay> app <malay>cakap</malay> waiting for driver <malay>nak dekat dua puluh</malay> minute in the end <malay>tak ada dia dah</malay> order order order <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap</malay> cancel <malay>dah tunggu</malay> twenty minutes (uh huh)
[ah] mothers' day [tau] I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
day <malay>ada orang dah</malay> advance order the day before to arrive for example [eh] <malay>dia cakap</malay> you order for today <malay>esok dia suruh</malay> deliver for <malay>makan tengah hari</malay>
<malay>pukul dua belas</malay> [ah] on the next day [lah] they advance order [lah] then when it comes on the day half an hour before <malay>dia orang</malay> cancel <malay>dia punya</malay> order
<malay>orang orang nak buat</malay> celebration <malay>dia orang buat macam gini tu</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault [lah] it's all the the the the restaurants <malay>kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana</malay> then restaurant <malay>yang cakap</malay> cancel but <malay>dia orang tak</malay> fair [lah] then the driver the rider <malay>kena marah</malay>
(mm)
I think maybe for safety <malay>juga</malay> [lah] I think <malay>kalau satu</malay> not not <malay>dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi</malay> check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver <malay>lepas tu orang tu cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dalam</malay> [eh] inside my my packet got
for example [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> I see hair then they complain <malay>kat</malay> restaurant <malay>nanti</malay> restaurant will <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang yang</malay> pack <malay>makanan</malay> so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy <malay>kerja dia</malay> is just to send so <malay>kalau</malay>
that one I not too sure [lah] but you know they earn also not much
ya
ya ya [lah] you can see <malay>tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang</malay> still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard (err) I got one friend <malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>satu</malay> (err) whenever <malay>dia</malay> order
(err) I think her mum [lah] her mum surely will will
<malay>kasih dia orang</malay> tip <malay>kasih</malay> cash ya [lah] but sometimes [a'ah] <malay>dia kasih</malay> extra like maybe two dollar <malay>ke lima</malay> dollar
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I think so but I think maybe
maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya [lah] but good [lah] then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot [what] <malay>kalau dapat</malay> tip and not say
<malay>kerja dia orang senang</malay> ya [lah] <malay>senang</malay> as in <malay>cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang</malay> customer complain [lah] customer <malay>marah</malay> so I think once in a while <malay>ada orang</malay>
<malay>kasih</malay> tip <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>kasih dorang macam</malay> motivate <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] at least <malay>ada juga orang yang</malay>
<malay>baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah</malay> [jer]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada</malay> deliver [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>cari semua tak ada</malay>
<malay>tapi nasi ambeng ada</malay> deliver <malay>tapi nasi padang</malay> I think <malay>tak ada</malay>
(uh) [oh]
<malay>kesian</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak ada</malay> offered to refund <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> that's not good actually
cannot [lah] the customer <malay>dia orang bayar apa</malay>
ya [lah] if you pay then I think cannot [lah] I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
so <malay>nanti esok</malay> you <malay>nak ikut tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling (mm)
I think <malay>kita dah</malay> quite long time <malay>kita tak pergi</malay> #changi# beach [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] we go <malay>kita pergi</malay> early [lah] morning you know I mean by by <malay>tengah hari</malay> we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya [lah] this quite some time I <malay>pun dah lama tak tak</malay> ride my bicycle
you <malay>punya</malay> bicycle <malay>masih ada tak</malay> then okay [lah] is it the same one that you <malay>beli dulu</malay>
cause recently I think that day I I I <malay>ada beli</malay> I went to the bicycle shop [lah] to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet <malay>dah dah koyak dia punya</malay> strap I was talking to the owner of the shop <malay>dia cakap sekarang</malay> like everyday <malay>dia jual</malay> like maybe
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
I think so cause that time <malay>dia orang tak boleh</malay>
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
wherever [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> shopping [lah]
I think <malay>dia baru baru buka</malay> [lah] !aiya! maybe I don't know <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh]
maybe [lah] I think they they the the new movies I think maybe <malay>kalau rasa</malay>
you <malay>rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> maybe they wait [lah] they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full [lah] I think if they full also it'll be
ya there's no <malay>apa</malay>
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya [lor] but if ya [lah] okay [lah] if you okay
<malay>esok esok kita pergi</malay> to #changi# after that after that <malay>kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak</malay> (mm)
okay <malay>kita pergi</malay> the famous one [lah] <malay>kat sana yang</malay> #changi#
famous
I think the I don't know I think maybe the <malay>sambal</malay> [lah] okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
basic
three dollars [lah] then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that [lah] but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
<malay>esok kita boleh</malay> try [lah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau makcik</malay>
<malay>beli</malay> I <malay>senyum kalau pakcik</malay> then you <malay>senyum</malay> okay think just nice [lah] so we go cycling then go <malay>nasi lemak</malay> ya then after that we head back
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tu dah macam yang kat</malay> #bangkok# <malay>kadang-kadang boleh panas</malay>
<malay>abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu</malay> ya
I think <malay>dia punya macam</malay>
ya [lah] I think <malay>dia punya mungkin</malay> usually like that <malay>dia punya dia punya</malay> what you call that <malay>dia punya longkang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> drainage <malay>sumbat</malay> of course [lah] then <malay>kalau dia punya</malay> rain was like that day
I think the rain was
<malay>pagi sampai petang</malay> what six seven hours ya [lah]
if the rain that much then the drain <malay>sumbat mana air nak pergi</malay>
[oh]
ya [lah] <malay>tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang</malay> those landed property
you stay there ya [lah] will damage all the property [lah]
okay [lah] but this kind of weather I think <malay>susah nak</malay> predict <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan</malay> or the other way that day <malay>pagi hujan lebat</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> stop
<malay>terus panas terik</malay>
I think <malay>dia orang</malay> also just <malay>tikam</malay> [jer] [lah]
they just guess maybe
maybe it's the other side maybe you <malay>kat</malay> east side #tampines# maybe <malay>kat</malay> #choa chu kang# <malay>ke</malay> #jurong# <malay>yang hujan</malay> right (mm) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like like that [what] not the whole singapore
(uh) [oh] <malay>kesiannya</malay> then
ya
confirm [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) that means ya [lah] <malay>lama</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] but (mm)
I think most of the the what you call it <malay>apa dia panggil</malay> dengue hot spot [eh] <malay>dah banyak dulu</malay> I think <malay>tak banyak tempat</malay> I think near my place also <malay>kat</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ada</malay> there there there's (err)
one case opposite my block (mm) ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum <malay>dengar</malay> then <malay>terus dia pergi luar dia</malay> check <malay>dia punya pasu-pasu bunga</malay> make sure <malay>tak ada</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> the officers <malay>datang</malay>
they can summon you [kan] I think ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you have like <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I think they come random [lah] it's either that or either that or I don't know [eh] <malay>mungkin kalau ada</malay> neighbour <malay>yang</malay> complain <malay>tak tahu kalau</malay> the neighbours suspect you you <malay>tak</malay>
maybe [lah] maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> take like a a sample
of the water something like <malay>dia orang bawa</malay>
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> lab <malay>agaknya dia orang</malay> check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back [lah] they take some sample of the <malay>air bawa balik</malay> to lab then run <malay>dia orang</malay> test <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] but ya [lah] sometimes they will check [what] even if they cannot see <malay>kalau dia orang tengok</malay> let's say <malay>rumah</malay> you
<malay>ada ada</malay> plants <malay>ada</malay> potted plants then <malay>dia punya air dia tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak tukar</malay> they will <malay>tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air</malay> do you change everyday because by right you <malay>kena tukar</malay> so at least if
happen to be the <malay>nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau</malay> you <malay>tukar hari-hari</malay>
then <malay>dapat dapat</malay>
but you you get to <malay>buang dia punya telur apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you
<malay>tak tukar</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> I <malay>pernah baca</malay> I don't know [lah] maybe takes a few days [lah] maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the <malay>nyamuk</malay>
<malay>telur</malay> to <malay>tukar</malay> [lah] so <malay>kalau</malay> you leave it for that long then maybe you might <malay>kena</malay> summon [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> check so that time my my mum <malay>dengar dia terus</malay> check
ya [lah] <malay>kat rumah pun semua tukar</malay> at least everyday [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah] the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that [lah]
ya [lah] so <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> ya [lah] because the the like what's the
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito <malay>dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kena gigit pun</malay> (mm)
so I think if you if you <malay>rasa macam</malay> you <malay>kena gigit dengan</malay> mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor [lor] <malay>dia punya</malay> mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then <malay>dua tiga hari lepas tu</malay> you <malay>demam</malay> I think better go doctor you check
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tak ada dia</malay>
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
(mm) then that one can can can lead to complications [lah] <malay>kalau tak kalau biasa punya</malay> after some time it will it will get better ya [lah] but <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you <malay>kena</malay> dengue
ya so how to prevent
then you cannot see [what] <malay>kalau dia nak gigit</malay> you <malay>dia pun tak tak</malay> warning
ya
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day <malay>dia punya</malay> the number of cases for COVID [lah] was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya [lah] but
these countries I guess because <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
ya then some of them might not be even <malay>kat</malay> hospital you know
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high [lah] okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya ya [lah] because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers <malay>tak boleh kerja</malay> [kan]
ya I know ya
(uh) (uh) maybe ya
ya I think so
ya [lah] but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
<malay>semua orang</malay> first time <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> ya but
not only the construction [lah] I think when the
foreign workers was was told to quarantine [eh] quarantine themselves <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> dormitory <malay>tu kalau</malay> I <malay>tak tahu rumah</malay> you you <malay>tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat</malay> my office <malay>pun sama dia punya</malay>
<malay>pokok-pokok dia punya daun semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah tak terjaga</malay> ya [lah] that shows
so ya [lah] you can see that actually
the foreign workers are important only time time <malay>macam gini</malay> then people realise [oh] ya ya [lah] this during this difficult
period you <malay>boleh tengok macam orang yang</malay> what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>tadi kita</malay> complain <malay>pasal</malay> grab food driver and all that ya <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine <malay>kalau dia orang tak ada</malay> that time circuit breaker you <malay>nak makan macam mana</malay>
ya [lah] some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya [lah] if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch <malay>baru dapat</malay>
[kan] nowadays (mm)
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody <malay>bersihkan</malay> know your around your area under your block all that
(mm)
true ya (mm)
ya once in awhile [jer] [lah]
ya [lah] but <malay>tempat</malay> your workplace how you still going to work or
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
when that day I think I was at the area [lah] raffles down there [lah] you can see I was there lunch time <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> (mm) can see that there is definitely different [lah] you see the lunch time crowd <malay>macam</malay> more like a ghost town I would say
ya [lor] but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay [lah] ya [lah] okay [lah] if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
including my my <malay>tempat kerja pun</malay> I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen [lah] sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause <malay>sekarang dah berapa tiga</malay> [eh] <malay>dah tiga</malay> since march <malay>dah lima bulan dah</malay>
most of the most of the business
working from home still <malay>masih</malay> survive <malay>apa</malay> so why do they need to like rent office <malay>mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap</malay> business <malay>jalan</malay>
true
ya
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kat rumah pun</malay> at least you save transport right if ya [lah] our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
two to three hundred on transport food
(mmhmm)
maybe the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you spend more I <malay>rasa mungkin</malay> is just your utilities [lor]
[kan] <malay>bila</malay> at home
whenever you on the fan [lah] you on your laptop cause usually
ya
if not usually you are at home <malay>malam-malam</malay> and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven <malay>hari-hari</malay>
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya [lah] but funny
because <malay>bila dulu</malay> time <malay>sebelum</malay> all these <malay>terjadi orang semua nak keluar</malay> so <malay>sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah</malay>
[a'ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang nak pergi</malay>
airline <malay>pun</malay> even the airline <malay>nak pergi pun</malay> the the the I think the government doesn't allow
ya I mean like once in a while
<malay>kat</malay> singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though <malay>kecil</malay> still got a lot of places if you want to explore
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe (err) get people to stay home more
give them more things to do if all the businesses <malay>tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat</malay>
<malay>takkan nak tengok</malay> [jer] [eh] but everything
ya I think like <malay>hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak</malay> it's not like <malay>kita</malay>
we said what the <malay>wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun</malay> the cinemas <malay>belum buka</malay> so
ya but not
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new <malay>macam wayang</malay> I mean <malay>filem-filem yang baru mungkin</malay> more people will will go <malay>kalau tak ada orang</malay> not interested ya [lah] at least they have entertainment at home or more
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya [lah] like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
your ya but I think no choice [lah] <malay>sekarang semua kena gitu</malay>
ya like <malay>dulu pun macam apa tu</malay> during <malay>bulan puasa orang nak bayar</malay> what you call that the <malay>zakat fitrah</malay> ya but now also everything online [what] <malay>dulu</malay> people would queue at the
<malay>masjid</malay> you know (mm) even
the <malay>yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban</malay> also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya
ya
okay
ya [lah]
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the [kan] they do everything at around your what you call that
(mmhmm)
ya I think all the woodlands #jurong# I think they were I forgot I think <malay>tak salah</malay> I <malay>ada sepuluh</malay> ya ten different places where they have the celebration [lah] ya
ya
ya <malay>kalau dia orang buat dekat</malay> the same place then more people will go there [what] so I think they have to [lah] to to <malay>elakkan orang</malay> go to like the #padang# or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people <malay>tak akan</malay> you know <malay>berkumpul</malay> at the <malay>tempat</malay> which is better [lah] everything [lah] like (err) I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
postpone postpone next year
ya [lah] cannot [lah] some more <malay>lagi</malay> that kind of event I think you're talking about
ya millions of people [lah]
okay [lah] but better [lah] like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
(err) can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
saw got people post <malay>gambar-gambar yang</malay> the river singapore river [lah] the some of the beaches the sea looks
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing [lah] it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they (err) those india and china those populated countries who have like (err) haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so <malay>tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi</malay> and then <malay>kita kat sini</malay> I mean we don't experience that that [lah] but for me personally I <malay>tengok bila</malay> during circuit breaker <malay>tak banyak kereta</malay> you can see like you said <malay>bila kita pergi</malay> jogging <malay>kat luar ke apa macam</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> fresh <malay>dia punya</malay> air <malay>tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta</malay> right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also [lah] that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
(mm) you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
<malay>apa yang yang</malay> I <malay>nak cakap</malay> you <malay>tak payah</malay> spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive [what] you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this (err) COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake [lah] ya suddenly ya cause I got
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business [lah] like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves [lah] but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you <malay>ada</malay> whatever [lah]
hobby <malay>baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh]
<malay>main gitar bernyanyi</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kalau</malay> if this thing didn't happen you you'd <malay>takkan tahu yang</malay> all this thing you <malay>boleh buat</malay> so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side [lah] or what
has
ya [lah]
(mm) ya right
<malay>kita</malay> complain complain <malay>hari-hari pagi petang malam pun</malay> you complain also the thing will still remain then <malay>takkan</malay> today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
right
true ya but I guess people are just people <malay>dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap</malay> right
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] government government <malay>kasih duit orang</malay> complain government <malay>tak kasih duit pun orang</malay> complain
so I think ya
<malay>betul kita cakap orang pun</malay> I think <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>pun</malay> complain <malay>juga</malay>
true ya true
ya [lah] once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> you <malay>tak boleh degil</malay> you know <malay>nak dengar cakap</malay> you [jer]
ya
ya (mm) (mm)
ya that's what I mean [lah] ya
complain but at the end of the day I think especially <malay>kita kat sini kat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kita</malay> still not as bad as you compare to other countries
other countries other countries they locked down like
you can't even I mean you can maybe you <malay>boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin</malay> you <malay>boleh beli</malay>
<malay>beras</malay> all those <malay>barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin</malay>
<malay>satu minggu sekali</malay> but still singapore I think
not bad [what] like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
(mm)
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
<malay>itu pun ada orang</malay> [kan] that time <malay>berapa</malay> a lot of people <malay>masuk</malay> facebook <malay>masuk</malay> stomp <malay>tak nak pakai</malay> then <malay>kena kena</malay> all the officers <malay>suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal</malay>
(mm)
ya by right <malay>bukan susah benda tu nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
I see them <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that time
government <malay>kasih</malay> free [leh] <malay>nak minta dia orang pakai</malay>

all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
pricing <malay>mahal</malay> Secret Lab <malay>paling murah</malay> four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
similar <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> Secret Lab <malay>ada</malay> five years warranty APOL <malay>dua</malay> year [jer]
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for Secret Lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material <malay>kalau terkoyak-koyak</malay> [kan] <malay>kopek-kopek</malay> then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
<malay>tapi air tumpah tak</malay> damage <malay>apa</malay> you can just straightaway <malay>lap</malay> the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
<malay>tu</malay>
ya <malay>aku nampak</malay> I saw that [one] <malay>basuh</malay> the <malay>lantai</malay> then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] Coke like damn sweet [eh] I I'm not a fan of Coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]
ya standard correct
[ah]
[oh] carton
what that's for <malay>hari raya</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya ya syrup kind of base drink [ah]
that's non-fizzy
(mm) Seasons the blue colour [one] right
<malay>hijau</malay> [eh]
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
ya that [one] not bad because <malay>dia punya</malay> ice lemon tea flavour in that <malay>tak tak</malay> as strong [ah]
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] I think I got I think I never try Seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no I don't think so [eh] the I can't recall
maybe [ah]
[eh] so <malay>bila nak beli ni</malay> table tennis <malay>punya</malay> racket paddle
(mm)
(uh)
!alamak! <malay>pergi</malay> club room [ah] you <malay>cukai</malay> the paddles
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just <malay>lepak tak belajar</malay> this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
<malay>potong kaki</malay> [ah]
ya
ya true true
(uh)
I also finding [ah] I want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
<malay>tapi</malay> cafe
ya exactly cafe <malay>semua gaji</malay> like they don't pay you that well then at most <malay>kurang-kurang</malay>
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
but banquet <malay>malas</malay> [sia] bro banquet <malay>kerja lama kena diri</malay> then like it's not my thing [ah]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay>
never banquet I never do before that time was (uh) kitchen job [ah]
ya Grand Hyatt [ah]
that [one] <malay>kerja</malay> kitchen it's a cook (uh)

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay I tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] <malay>dorang kerja</malay> banquet <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] because <malay>dorang dah kerja lama</malay> so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager <malay>dorang tak buat kerja</malay> just like manage them tell them what to do then <malay>lepak</malay> so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
<malay>dua dua jam tiga jam</malay>
<malay>tapi dapat gaji</malay> for the whole thing then they just <malay>lepak makan</malay>
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why
[orh]
Shangri-La
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>kahwin</malay> [ah]

[oh]
[orh]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[oh]

so it's a win win
it's a win win situation [lah]
ya
true
actually that time I I <malay>pernah bilang kau</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kerja ni kat</malay> Marche or something
because
[eh] since when you care [sia] bro

he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right [ah]
freebies right <malay>keluar</malay> vouchers right

mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
but then he return vouchers so people like think like [eh] <malay>aku bayar macam gini tapi dapat</malay> voucher so like
then okay <malay>juga apa</malay>
ya exactly but then the thing is one thing good they don't have a minimum spending like what my sister do right she everytime <malay>pergi makan dengan</malay> boyfriend right
then they <malay>makan</malay> then talk talk because the boyfriend like
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
then right everytime go <malay>makan</malay> he'll give like twenty thirty dollar voucher like that so my sister and the boyfriend

you know cakes and (uh) tea or something like that

<malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya nanti kau pergi tengok dia punya</malay> game play it's like <malay>macam</malay>
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
I plan to but then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now DOTA also I don't really play that much
ya
five I don't know [ah] I never see since the pre-order part

the new series which is the what's that [ah] Vita
[ah] Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> necessary [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> touch screen and all
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
<malay>macam</malay> minecraft [ah]

ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
why the <malay>sewa murah</malay>
[ah]
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
<malay>makan</malay> hotdog <malay>pun dah marah</malay>
in school <malay>setiap kali</malay> I bring back food then you <malay>marah</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
<malay>itu sahaja</malay> I'm not gonna I'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
<malay>dekat</malay> cafe #bedok# cafe <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok#
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
(mm)
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
(mm)
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
(uh huh) paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane [eh]

and
and did you like it
(mmhmm)
(uh) that means <malay>kau suka</malay> [lah] <malay>kau akan cuba sahaja</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan</malay>
don't have courage to try new things
<malay>sebab itu kita selalu bila pergi</malay> india <malay>pergi tempat sama sahaja</malay> [eh] <malay>tak pergi keluar pergi mana-mana</malay>
if I give you <malay>arnab</malay>
okay
okay
so next time <malay>kalau kita balik</malay> india we won't go back to our hometown
go somewhere else
you say [one] [ah]
don't take back on your promise [ah]
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
[oh]
okay
(uh huh)
okay do you have any
(mm)
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar [lah]
then you did did you watch incredibles two
(mm)
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
(mm) <malay>entah aku pun tak tahu</malay> I think twenty twenty three maybe
or maybe <malay>mungkin tahun depan</malay>
ya or maybe <malay>tahun depan</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
or <malay>kau tak ingat</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
<malay>kau ada tengok ke</malay>
<malay>kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun</malay>
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] <malay>yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok</malay> [kan]
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but <malay>dia tua</malay> [kan] <malay>kau suka</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
<malay>yang dekat</malay>
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for (err) (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and <malay>yang</malay> help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
<malay>tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa</malay> then
ya then I'll decide then I also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities <malay>itu semua aku nak tanya nak</malay> settle
ya
ya <malay>hari isnin nak pergi</malay> then
probably <malay>jumaat balik</malay>
ya but (err) <malay>isnin isnin</malay> I meet my mentor then <malay>hari selasa aku ada</malay> event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday <malay>aku ada apa-apa tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but probably I come back either on thursday or friday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
<malay>macam dia orang</malay> complain [lah] <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay>
<malay>tak suka apa yang dia orang buat</malay> then which makes it very difficult
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
A level <malay>mana ada</malay> civil
you mean from my
no <malay>tak ada</malay> as in I
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different (err)
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
it's a fifty fifty thing [lah] <malay>ada orang suka ada orang tak suka</malay>
then <malay>yang tak suka itu dia orang</malay> struggle
then <malay>yang suka</malay> they they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me I
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
ya they talk they <malay>cakap apa itu</malay> they all said something about how they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that <malay>itu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> that's why like I said monday I'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then <malay>cepat-cepat datang</malay> then I <malay>dapat</malay> my
degree <malay>cepat-cepat habis</malay> my masters or
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go
after I graduate go
go <malay>belajar beberapa tahun</malay> then
<malay>aku ajar dekat</malay> primary school
okay <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja</malay>
okay
okay
(mmhmm)

okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
<malay>yang macam kau cakap demam ke</malay>
or the <malay>selesema</malay>
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like <malay>macam demam ke selesema itu semua</malay>
(mmhmm)

one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet #mee hoon#
<malay>yang basah punya</malay> I <malay>tak boleh makan</malay>
<malay>tak sedap</malay>

I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know [lah] (mm) (mm) is to cater to people
as in <malay>kalau kau makan satu</malay> pizza <malay>sama rasa bosan apa</malay>
so things to let people
have a bit more variety [lah]

<malay>tengok tengok tengok besok</malay> we will see tomorrow
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>pernah dengar</malay> I've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya I I I've seen it before someone cook like <malay>macam</malay> beef rose
or stew
<malay>berapa itu</malay>
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
<malay>kena tengok</malay>
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is <malay>kalau aku pergi dekat</malay> january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then <malay>kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan</malay> [kan]
she's working in [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no and then
ya different <malay>dia tak ada</malay> then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
<malay>dia punya bapak beli untuk dia</malay>
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so <malay>dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana</malay>
ya [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india <malay>pun ada</malay> north india
<malay>tak nak malas</malay> because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one <malay>aku dah</malay> check <malay>semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil</malay>
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and then <malay>bawah itu ada</malay> spain I think <malay>semua</malay>
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
so <malay>pergi</malay> or I or I <malay>pergi</malay>
no I don't want go [ah]
<malay>ada orang kita tahu ke</malay> do we know anyone in the
we don't have relatives there
<malay>siapa</malay>
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
(mm) okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
(uh) then we find it
(err)
<malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)

extra ordinary kind I think
(err) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay>

(err)
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya (err) but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that

if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates

(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>

(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken
