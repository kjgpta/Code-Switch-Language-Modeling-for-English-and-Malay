mm
orh
oh Jetstar
okay
orh
ah
okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
mm
mm
mm
mm okay so because kan you are the type of
mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
uh
so it was a bit weird lah ya
I know right oh my gosh ya
enjoying my sleep lah
then after that leh
the car outside kan
the but then I try to look out the window lah I wanted to kaypoh lor
and uh
ah so ya like that lor
so that's what happened
then after that
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
okay
oh
oh my god
eh that's so bad leh
mm
oh
so that's where I get my news also lah TikTok and Instagram
ya
the presidential debate
ya so
I understand
so ya so then kan
ah you know actually this year
save money so that I can like buy a house here
ah okay
oh
oh
oh oh that's very good
okay
ya
so then it's like
it's like if you have in the reports kan it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
you know or uh
and actually touch all these
ah
ah
and looking forward to phase three lah
okay
ya
oh
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
ya
ya lor that's true
if let's say you were the prime minister
okay
of the highest number of COVID cases
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
okay
oh that's not good
mm
ya
ya
as if lah it's so easy kan
mmhmm mm mm
it
so
so ya
so then
so today
so then oh uh so that's why this morning
I'm
so the breakfast wrap was only four dollars sixty five cents
but
uh it's one for one so end up the thing became only two dollars lah
so ya
ha and some more my pillow covers are all white
so it's like the thing turned red lah because
it will stain or if I wear anything white it will stain
ya but whose hair will be after you dye
exactly
ya but then but when it's wet it will stain my towel lah
mm
so ya lor like that lor
and then
eh
wow and I didn't
um this is for you and I was like oh
okay actually I didn't order this uh
uh ordered it oh okay
it's a local delivery
ya lah
sometimes my mum is okay lah
then
mm oh
the
mini golf kan
Holey Moley
norza
a'ah I went with her
orh
wah that's very good
okay but it's not too late for me to start
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
ha
huh
okay
for lah oh okay
ah
mm
mm
oh okay okay
okay
mm
unless we have this type of project lah
ya you know a little bit of extra do no harm lah kan
mm
so
mm
not right not right now only that I want to take my time and then we see what happens lah
mm
ya
so and and then actually
mm just
you know
have a career change
mm
mm
ya and then we ya so
and then so that's why it's a bit like
so ya
mm
like singapore living cost is a bit high
save a little bit more to make sure that you know that your parents are well taken care of lah so
step by step I guess one day at a time
mm
mm
mm
um
hong kong paris dubai
mm
kan
ya
eh
the furthest he will go is changi
the furthest he will go is changi
he won't go anymore where further than that
mm
mm
ya
that travel agencies will bring her to all these weird places kan
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
oh my gosh
right
ya
orh
only when I'm at home
mm
ya that's true
so then that what is the point of taking the leave you see
on leave
then I also take the leave
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm okay okay I see I see
mm I see
ya
so ya so you know I wrote an email to my management err my housing management because like
um
ya
to um
you know make sure that the the rubbish is thrown properly and responsibly lah ya
you mean I stand outside the rubbish chute and wait for the person to not throw the rubbish
no lor on the floor every floor or itself don't have the lor only got is in lobby
mm
um
oh okay
korean drama K drama is like
not really my thing lor but then I can try lah see how lah
a'ah
mmhmm
ya exactly
is that the word you were looking for
ya
not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs lah
then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
a'ah
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
mm
ya
huh
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
mm
so they are all back in lockdown
mm
mm I think so
mm
and the infection is is more um
the the virus is more infectious
mm
mm
uh
job offers
mm
mm
ya
you
become prolonged because
err
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
uh nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
mm
mm
ya
exactly
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes lor
hmm so ya
uh and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
mm
ya
mm
a'ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
um hmm
and then had to like
mm
mm
mm
mm
orh
presentation
oh
ya
ya
oh
oh
ya very like uh demotivating lah
mm
oh
oh media agency lah
mm mmhmm mm mm
mm
like err
ya
ya
mm
ya so
anyway
err
mm ya
okay
okay thank you bye bye

currently I haven't get my letter lah but
um
err
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me lah over good looks but
err
if I had to pick one then
how about you
err
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body lah but for good looks err if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it what so it's all down to genetics
err
err to fit body
err hopefully lah can you know live a healthier life and err not have any like
err
wah your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries um a bit more difficult to control lah especially if the country is very big right and
err maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason lah if let's say like scientists err cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this err
hunger and starvation maybe like
err people will like the population will eventually get reduced lah cause
um
if if this I mean don't know lah maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa lah of course other countries also you see the
mm ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
oh
mm err
I mean
better like not say change myself lah but like err how to say like relate to them and like
err whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly lah
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level lah
then maybe another skill would be like
err
like the kind err it comes together with like
err performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like um
err that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence lah I mean is err it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
err then
it's it's good lah in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards um
like
err
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just err accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said lah in the condition given is that
so like
err
increase my wealth from there lah whenever the stock market go up I can just err sell it if not I just hold on to it lah until the value is a good time to sell lah
ya
ya
for me ah probably
ability to teleport lah
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time lah like
even then like
is is not a problem lah you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower lah I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like err maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing lah that
err would would benefit like
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
err
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say lah with great power comes great responsibility kan so like
um
um
I feel like it's beneficial lah because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this err insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
mm
I mean
err I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
err whatever the case lah basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest err performance lah
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this err strong fit buff guy then
um
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be um
will come after you lah because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down lah like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then um
err just lay down in bed just like
like
um this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look ah like good like physical look
all err
they just err placed on me lah ya
okay lah
that's one but
um of course devote some portion of day to the person lah like
err partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
err going to work and all that then like
err I I still like to keep fit lah as I grow older so um
if possible
err
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
err athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing lah I feel like
err
very very important to you know err commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost lah but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person lah so that would be that would be ideal for me lah ya
err ya then
I feel lah that would be ideal for me lah because it's something I really enjoy and it
err
ya
but
err more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine lah ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
err
especially if it's like a a decently long ride lah
it takes time lah so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in err
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
err girlfriend lah ya

like
to the same person
ya
apparently if you do your wedding under the void deck now you only get two hours
ya two hours so she's like but no forget it
ya that's why she changed her mind lah so she did it at home
singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids
I don't even have twelve friends
don't know what corporate bridesmaid keeper ran to like how are you even forking out money for like of people too right
right
kan
like how how do you even have twelve friends who are
supposingly like ya
like how I don't understand sial like I think about it ah I only got five friends I can count on and that's it the numbers stops there it doesn't grow I don't want new friends I don't care for it
speaking about friend
speaking about friends so did she talk to you again
I cannot be bothered she ah messaged me and she said uh
I cannot

oh my god do you remember jamie
he texted me
he texted me twice this month
one asking me how I was lah this and that and then he said sorry that like
he never like remain in contact and that it was his fault and I'm like nah it's all good
I just said nah it's all good
then he asked me oh can you ask your friend if he can help us get the
private area at rumours for a birthday party I need it for a friend I'm like
err no guarantees but sure
ya
kan
he just has to book what
ya he can just book and it's not even that like now you want to book also it's not going to be as fun as that time
cause there are so much more stricter there are so much more stricter now
we went before like all that shit went down lah we went before the
the social distancing people even went there
ya
ee
I I think babe it's in july it was in july
start already lah but they were still like not very serious about the rules there
by six you have to pack up and leave you cannot stay later than six and then all the beach clubs close at like eight o'clock now apparently
ya so we got very lucky
kan
you lah busy
okay what's the date
but
it's like
mm
huh
ah
we can
we can do twelve
ya twenty six too far cannot twelfth is perfect
ya twelve is perfect
I don't even know how you broke your phone that day you know I really don't
I wasn't even drunk that day I just don't get how you oh I think I know when
when you was getting at andre's lobby and you fell remember
your phone didn't fold in half lah the screen just crack lah
try we I should just wait so you mean she at home you get ahead you they they can repair or ability or or go with their iphone or cold air cool white apron sky then err I don't know last night eh I really don't know eh you give exists food opposite the airport who got a C is you know what
I don't know
I really don't know how you broke your phone I cannot like to this day sometimes I really like think about it tau I retraced you know like every single thing we did that day
not once did we see your phone come out eh
huh
you're not that troublesome to me ah
all you had was one glass sial
wake boarding
you know my swimming skills are so terrible
my swimming skills a very terrible
I will still be able to drown trust me
I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
wah
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them one know in like the last message I got was that ah oh it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
hmm
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
aiyo
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
my some of my underwear is there

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it
