okay so after that the third year <malay>engkau</malay> move out because with your aunty and then
(uh huh)
[ah]
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
ya but is it your own your own <malay>punya</malay> feeling or <malay>memang</malay> they are the one who gave you hints
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> when you go back that time (uh) like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
(mm)
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
ya ya but you and her now <malay>dah</malay> okay [lah]
like become such a cool mum [ah]
having disputes [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree [lah] you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life [lah] mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy [lah] you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my <malay>nakal</malay> my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school [lah] they get into they they start to steal from shop [lah] that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument [ah] so <malay>aku suka jawab</malay> [jer] you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum [lah] you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course [lah] you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you [lah] you know you ended up becoming a fight often [ah] but for our case is not religious matters [lah] for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche [lah] because she was a single mother for awhile
[ah] so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] ya ya so I can understand her stress [ah] she was the old school hard knocks kind [lah] you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind [lah] if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness [lah] so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and (um) I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
[ah] when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two (err) I stayed at (uh) you know those government rental house ya I I stayed (uh) using (uh) someone's name [lah] ya because that person had was sick so she (uh) the <malay>nenek</malay> like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus [lah] ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely [lah] I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area (uh) my my house was at outram there the old school #jalan kukoh# [lah] you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better [ah]
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot [lah] and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay (uh) when when I was in my early twenties <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah</malay> so by right we already moved to #yishun# way back already [tau] but then (err) this (err) it's a it's a chinese family [lah] so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house [ah] so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room [lah] my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us [lah] but you can feel [lah] after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like <malay>rimas</malay> if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate [lah] then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you [lah] the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight [lah] like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve [tau] but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her !alah! she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like <malay>kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke</malay> you know
yes
passionate [ah] <malay>kira</malay> defensive [ah]
grow up
ya
tense up [ah] [ah]
ya ya
fight [ah] ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing [ah] ya
ya ya
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
probably probably ya
(mm)
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear [lah] [ah] if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why [ah] what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside [leh] you look soft outside and inside you are [eh] fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it [ah]
adamant [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
ya
(mm)
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] you know what dude actually what right (uh) one thing you should actually I recommend [lah] you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book [ah] dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that [eh] no no some people actually (uh) you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique [lah] then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a !wah! dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what [lah] but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good [lah]
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook [ah] and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F [ah]
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example [lah] (uh) you know like how sometimes people (um) okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very #nya# one the #nya# one [ah] actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before [ah] !wah! sometimes when people in the level of managerial position [ah] are sometimes very #guai lan# you know bro <malay>dia orang</malay>
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel (um) wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the #mats# can walk like that or the #bengs# they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
ya [lah] but no [lah] I truly mean it empathise [lah] <malay>kau jangan ketawa</malay> now you make me feel bad for laughing
like !whoa! so big like they as if they got like big triceps [ah] that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also [lah] ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
[oh] really [ah]
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time [lah] [ah]
opening [ah] ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
[a'ah] then then then
I I think so [ah] why [ah] recall recall recall help me recall
[oh] ya okay okay then then then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
!oi! my memory very bad [lah] bro very bad bro (mm)
(mm)
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
[ah]
ya
ya
okay
something new [ah]
(oo)
[eh] but dude I thought all this while <malay>memang</malay> you were actually very motivated to be a pilot [what] no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
okay [ah]
ya ya you can like transfer [ah] ya
okay
[ha]
flying [ah] (mm)
[ah]
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about <malay>macam mana kau jadi</malay> pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid [tau] not the interest [tau] the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
okay
okay
okay
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky [ah] that person should never have been a pilot [sia] but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
[oh] eventually they change [lah] when did they change
okay okay
(mm)
(mm) ya ya ya
okay
!wah! motivated like crazy [sia]
[oh] very young [ah]
[ah]
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
(uh huh)
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
okay
okay
let go [ah]
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying [ah] you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly [what] okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay [ah]
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength [ah] ya ya ya
[oh] but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career [lah] it's more of like (uh) okay okay not not so much of a mistake [lah] not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
[ah]
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
[ah]
okay
[ah]
(mm)
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
(oo) <malay>sayangnya</malay>
[oh]
[a'ah]
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
(mm)
okay
this was when [ah]
how you afford all these things man operation [lah] go [lah]
you loan [ah]
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
[eh] no [lah] because new house you say you use [mah] you don't have to cash contribute [what] <malay>ada</malay> how much
!oi! okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room [ah]
but you're
ya
[ah] who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
[eh] that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know [ah] it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no [ah]
just a cross [ah] [oh] okay
no you know why because I don't know [lah] it depends on my future [lah] because for now there's a lot of changes [ah] okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
#dubai# right #dubai# airline is it
[oh]
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience [ah]
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that [lah]
[ah]
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit [lah] ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry [lah] the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts [ah]
(mm)
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal [ah]
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
(mm)
!wah! how many airplanes [sia] bro like that
!wah! I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue [lah] like from steward to be flying [lah] okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is (uh) my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
[oh] you went through the three months [ah] [oh] it was supposed to be that stage already [lah] [oh]
!wah! dude that time if you fly [ah] your inter pretty stable and nice [ah] bro four to six K easily [sia]
[eh] but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know <malay>nasib kentang</malay> [eh] like like first okay [lah] the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID <malay>pula</malay> happen like !wow!
your <malay>nasib</malay> is so <malay>kentang</malay> [lah] dude
<malay>nasib kau sangat kentang</malay> bro I don't know why I say <malay>kentang</malay> [ah] but I feel like it sounds right <malay>nasib kau kentang</malay>
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike [ah]
ya ya
!walao! I don't think that's anywhere close [sia]
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there [sia] on the drone
okay
that's relatable [lah]
[ah] okay okay so it's just a matter of time [lah]
another <malay>ujian</malay>
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to #salihin# <malay>ni</malay> edwin <malay>jadi nyanyuk</malay> ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there <malay>orang yang dalam</malay> asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you [siol] [lah] funny [sia]
[siol] [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of #mumammad salihin#
ya then eventually when people see the peak [ah] [lah] it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession [eh] but okay [lah] but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story [lah] I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist [ah] so she's like a old lady [lah] you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage [lah] like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just <malay>macam</malay> smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya like for you you are like [oh] crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum [lah] so ya but but but no [lah] I I wish you all the best [ah] brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it [lah] it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field [oh]
(mm)
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him [ah] ya like before him right you see bush !wah! everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him [ah] the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman [lah]
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics [ah] in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no [lah] bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back [eh] okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that [lah] but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead [mah] like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks [what] the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people [lah] the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have #genghis khan# you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them [lah] you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that (um) people just have space to voice out things
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing [what] you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you <malay>kena</malay> arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you <malay>kena</malay> arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing [lah] as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see [lah]
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person [lah] how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now [lah] because if I go there I will die of boredom [sia]
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand [mah] so <malay>aku</malay> anytime can just like you know [eh]
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something [lah] but I'm not in touch with him that much [lah]
he's a new zealander but <malay>sekarang</malay> he stay in australia
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old [lah] I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains [ah] then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom [lah] there's nothing to do [sia] there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know [lah] okay
no it's not about <malay>mahal</malay> bro even if it's not <malay>mahal</malay> you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand <malay>macam mana</malay> if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example [lah] like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and (um) I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how [sia]
a plan [ah]
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business [lah] [oh] I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no [lah] basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay [lah] I will just give you a brief verbal presentation [ah] people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example [oh] bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why [oh] why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
[ah]
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much [mah]
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say [oh] my house will <malay>kena tarik</malay> they will say [oh] I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
the only reason how they can <malay>tarik</malay> your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
they will just cut your utility [lor]
ya
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house <malay>kena tarik</malay> not true okay number two (uh) you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy (uh) I give you one one scenario [lah] one of one of this person [oh] like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount [lah] so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay [lah] you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
because your will still cut [mah] <malay>bulan-bulan</malay> for the house [ah] okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you [ah] bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people [lah] okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole [lah] which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor [lah] okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk [mah] you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan [lah] okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets [lah] you know you buy Rolex [lah] you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there [mah]
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions [lah] your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong [lah] but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example [ah] they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government (uh) supreme court order you to pay [lah] like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone [lah] that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years [lah] depending on the amount that you have to pay (err) so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that [one] right they are the people like [ah] fuck it [lah] I don't want to pay <malay>aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat</malay> [ah] so if they never pay then they cannot travel
they have to stay in singapore [ah]
cannot [ah]
their their their passport is blocked [what] they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead [lah] you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go [lah] you know
ya
but it's not like so long in advance <malay>pun</malay> you know it's just like a day probably you know [ah] but the thing is people thought [oh] cannot that kind of thing
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you (uh) they cannot [lah] they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay [lah] they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy [ah] so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna (uh) work in production houses if the company feel like [eh] there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you [lor] private entity [what]
[ah] so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
[ah] like this kind of job [ah] the one that is got profile [one] [ah] they normally will not hire you [one]
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system [lah] ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests [ah]
ya [lah] for example okay I give you a scenario [ah] let's say you owe ten thousand [lah] the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred [lah]
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month [lah] okay
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will <malay>tambah balik</malay> one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario [lah] so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay [lah] let's say you you a newly married couple [lah] okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans [mah]
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial (uh) the debt trap [ah] okay so the second way is to pay a minimum [eh]
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay <malay>habis</malay> [kan] another thing [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the second way let's say <malay>macam</malay> the minimum [eh] some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the <malay>susu</malay> pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come [lah] lawyer letter come [lah]
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic [ah] this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see [lah] they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country [lah] [ah] so [ah] normally they have their debt consolidation plan [lah] that debt management program [lah] all these thing [lah] this is by the by the banks [lah] of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria [lah] you know you are [eh] <malay>aku rasa dah habis</malay> [ah] bro okay [lah] five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done [ah] okay
