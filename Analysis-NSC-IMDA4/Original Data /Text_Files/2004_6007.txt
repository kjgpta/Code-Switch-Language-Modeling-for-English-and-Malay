[ah] <malay>kau tak nak cari kerja ke</malay> as in not not directly <malay>macam kau tak nak cari kerja</malay> but more like (um) <malay>kau nak buat apa sekarang</malay> like [oh] (uh) <malay>kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah</malay> like you know this kind of thing then I I've I <malay>rasa macam</malay> a bit pressured [lah] it's not <malay>macam</malay> I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I am also like trying [lah] to look for a job but right now in this situation like the economy and like with the pandemic it's not it's not easy [lah] to get a job I like considering to go back Coffee Bean also you know but
ya I know I know right
ya it's very taxing [sia] that job
I <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>pergi balik pun</malay> I <malay>tak nak jadi</malay> manager anymore [lah] it's very it was very shitty
ya
and then <malay>sekarang pun</malay> they already increase (um) part-time <malay>punya</malay> pay to I think eight
last time my
ya I
ya I know right then <malay>dorang</malay> increase I <malay>lupa</malay> [lah] I <malay>punya</malay> pay <malay>berapa</malay> but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
like I don't know how I stayed there for five years being paid like nine dollars
[what]
ya ya ya ya ya
!aiya! so wasted
ya ya ya
(mm) ya so I I only applied
dental assistant ya like I'm looking for around like #bishan# or around #choa chu kang#
<malay>sebab</malay> I can send simon to work
and then I <malay>boleh pergi kerja dari sana</malay> because he cannot ride to work [mah]
ya then only during this course <malay>yang</malay> they <malay>kasi</malay> him ride his bike <malay>tapi</malay> he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
eight july I think
(err) <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] he <malay>cakap nak naik</malay> bus <malay>tapi naik</malay> bus is very very far for him
ya is <malay>jauh gila</malay>
ya then <malay>cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah</malay> your
mum then
ya and then
<malay>kita kat sana kita tinggal kat</malay> hall [seh] babe <malay>kat tilam</malay> and then for five days you wanna
you wanna do that I don't wanna
like <malay>kita ada</malay> our own <malay>macam</malay> room at #bishan# and then <malay>macam</malay> I I don't feel comfortable [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then <malay>macam</malay> no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want [lah] like I don't mind to <malay>macam pagi-pagi</malay> you <malay>ambil</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> bike you <malay>pergi</malay> #sungei gedong# then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay [lah] for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he <malay>punya</malay> reporting time is <malay>pukul</malay> like <malay>tujuh</malay> sometime <malay>enam setengah</malay> then <malay>pukul berapa nak keluar rumah</malay> you know
ya
#sungei gedong# you <malay>tahu</malay> (um) <malay>kubur sana</malay>
<malay>kubur</malay>
like <malay>pusaraman</malay>
ya #lim chu kang# but <malay>lagi dalam</malay>
plus the
#choa chu kang# is very [what]
[ah] my house is very near to his workplace <malay>tapi takkan</malay> I <malay>nak duduk sana lima hari</malay> [kan]
which one my sister
[oh] my god no <malay>dia takkan kasi punya</malay> girl
she won't [lah] <malay>dia tak kasi punya</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak kasi</malay> [lah] my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
anything you want a new house
(mm) (mm)
ya and then (uh) he <malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>nak kena tunggu dia habis</malay> tour <malay>dia baru</malay>
(err) he will maybe <malay>pergi</malay> #nee soon# camp then it will be closer to his workplace already [eh] I mean his house <malay>tapi</malay>
ya #mandai# but it's <malay>lagi lama</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi</malay> maybe around one year one point five years
ya it's just the workplace [lah] very very #mafan#
cause <malay>dorang tak kasi</malay> ride bike right <malay>abeh macam orang</malay> regular [seh] ya exactly the <malay>dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi</malay> the <malay>naik motor</malay> like everyone in <malay>dia punya</malay>
(uh) what do they call name battalion I guess (err) <malay>tak boleh naik motor</malay> you can only <malay>naik</malay> public transport <malay>atau</malay> you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I <malay>belum kerja</malay> [seh] <malay>kita belum</malay> apply <malay>rumah belum kerja</malay> then you <malay>nak</malay> talk about having a car
!aiya!
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[a'ah] I think you you you <malay>nak kena fikir</malay> about it's not just about petrol [tau] about like <malay>dia punya</malay> season parking <malay>berapa dia punya</malay> road tax <malay>berapa</malay>
ya that's why <malay>dia punya</malay> season parking <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> what's that called [ah] road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like [ah]
ya
right
I don't know I <malay>tak tahu apa</malay> is going on in his head that he thinks
ya <malay>macam</malay> I find <malay>tak</malay>
makes sense [lah] if you <malay>nak</malay> if you <malay>nak apa ni</malay> [ah] restrict from (uh) riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days <malay>abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik</malay> bus
then
<malay>tak boleh</malay> because this thing is not (um) <malay>macam baru baru</malay> [jer] they say [oh] you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to change it [lah]
ya it's damn <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] I see
then after that <malay>dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik</malay> bus <malay>jauh</malay> [sia] babe even I <malay>nak balik rumah</malay> I'd rather take my motorbike go home to #choa chu kang# <malay>apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja</malay>
ya
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>satu</malay> bus [jer] <malay>pergi sana abeh</malay> it's also together with like the
foreign workers cause their dormitory is also inside
ya and bus <malay>kat</malay> that that bus nine seven five <malay>tu</malay> [oh] my god
they <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
like send right
(err) simon
(err) with army is it
his contract is like (err) you have to I think five years and then after that it's up until fifty five
ya so it's like for for lifetime kind of thing [lah]
(mm) (mm) yes
(mm) (mm) ya you're not really affected by <malay>macam</malay>
like the economy but I mean affected a bit [lah] it's not like you retrenched [lah] <malay>macam</malay> bonus <malay>dia tak dapat</malay> for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant [kan] <malay>tak dapat</malay>
so but it's not so bad [lah] at least you know he still has a job
rather than
(err) <malay>dia kena</malay> retrenched
it's so worrying now
it's okay the actually we are
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
yes we we are still saving for the chinese wedding
so our money is already like thrown into the wedding and everything right
then we ya [lah] (err) that's why it feels like we're living from paycheck to paycheck because (err) he has to set aside money for the wedding still cause it's still going on so up until then we will be living like this [ah]
<malay>tapi tak tak</malay> confirmed <malay>juga apa kalau</malay> we <malay>masih</malay> hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three

then <malay>dorang tak boleh beli</malay> their <malay>barang</malay> from there [what] so they have to buy it from singapore [what]
and then after that I <malay>cakap dengan dorang</malay> [lah] I give like <malay>kata putus</malay> like that I say (um)
<malay>kalau sampai</malay> end of the year [ah] I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money <malay>sebab</malay> if you think about it [eh] <malay>duit yang</malay> I down <malay>dengan dorang belum pakai</malay> [tau]
