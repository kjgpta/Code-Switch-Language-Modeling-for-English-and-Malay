you close club at ten o'clock ten [oh] ten ten ten you never come out the thing <malay>halau</malay> you [lah] [sia]
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
<malay>budak-budak sana</malay> [lah]
so minnie minnie <malay>kena apa</malay> [tau] closing and minnie is a kind that's not like us [tau] <malay>macam pakai benda terus buka boleh keluar</malay>
hers is like <malay>memang kena tukar seluar baju</malay> makeup bag alright
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
suddenly she turn around <malay>ada orang macam dia rasa ada orang pekik dekat muka dia</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
you know right so that stairs minnie <malay>pernah jalan</malay>
<malay>orang tolak dia benda tolak dia gila babi sampai dia terus</malay> land <malay>dekat bawah</malay>
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
<malay>orang tolak dia terus macam</malay> <malay>lepas tu dia terus jatuh dia jatuh</malay> all the way to the to the floor
(mm) (mm) all the way down
<malay>terus macam</malay> okay
ya so like the the part where
the <malay>benda</malay> will always
the <malay>benda</malay> will always <malay>macam apa ni</malay>
(uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay>
ya like
bang the weights all this <malay>semua orang pernah kena</malay>
everyone that's one hundred always <malay>tutup</malay> exactly
ten O two
ten o'clock <malay>semua orang dia dah halau</malay>
because <malay>dia orang pun tak nak kena</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang ni</malay> real [siol]
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
the connected to the hotel <malay>apa</malay> the for the swimming pool
ya maybe so
<malay>pagi orang</malay> opening shift so opening shift
<malay>masuk</malay>
no opening shift is <malay>masuk</malay> !siala! I open the shutter I have to be the first person there
unless I open shutter aunty cleaner <malay>ada</malay>
with me
then there will be two of us correct
<malay>dia</malay> open shutter <malay>dia nampak</malay> member <malay>jalan</malay>
so <malay>dia macam</malay> sir the gym is not open yet
<malay>kau</malay> first person [tau] <malay>buka apa yang kau nak berbual dengan</malay> member
so (uh) then I say why you why you say like that no because I didn't think like that [lah] I think <malay>macam</malay> member <malay>macam</malay> (uh) coming from the the swimming pool like you forget to lock the door or what then he sneak in
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say [ah]
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
so this person <malay>jalan</malay> towards this treadmill <malay>ni</malay> pillar [eh] <malay>jalan</malay> this way so this I thought <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau nak main</malay> catching I will walk here and <malay>kejar</malay> you surround you here
so <malay>dia dah tunggu sini tunggu tunggu tunggu orang ni tak jalan-jalan</malay> so <malay>dia tengok tak ada</malay>
and <malay>dia macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>orang ni dah keluar pergi</malay> back door <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah keluar balik dekat</malay> shutter <malay>dia pergi tengok dekat</malay> <malay>dia berbual seorang</malay>
<malay>dia kejar benda</malay> nothing
and then me <malay>asal kau buka</malay> <malay>asal kau</malay> very curious
<malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak kena tengok betul-betul apa dia masuk daripada pintu mana aku nak tengok</malay> closing shift <malay>semalam tak tutup pintu ke apa</malay> I need to know
<malay>sekarang kau dah tahu sendiri kau berbual dengan siapa tu</malay>
<malay>kau nak hidup kau ni sekarang apa maksud dia</malay> <malay>hidup kau tak ada makna</malay> [tau] <malay>hidup kau tu permainan syaitan</malay>
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
<malay>macam benda yang macam kena tolak ni semua</malay> okay [ah] <malay>kena kena pekik</malay> you know you hear it you feel the air but you don't see it
<malay>tapi ni sampai kau nampak orang</malay>
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
(uh) you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
<malay>terus dah</malay> tired <malay>gitu</malay> and then
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so #lasiri# was sleeping
<malay>terus dia kena hempap</malay>
so [ah] so ya people when they say <malay>hempap</malay> [eh] <malay>hempap ni semua dia ada</malay> scientific reason
there is a scientific reason for all that [what]
then
when I say cannot [ah] will say no bro
when I <malay>tengah itu aku buka aku dapat buka mata cuma aku tak dapat pekik aku dapat buka mata</malay>
<malay>aku dapat buka mata</malay> [kan] and then
and then <malay>dia kata apa ni</malay>
(err) I saw the <malay>lembaga</malay>
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer [what] so she went to this one guy
!hey! bro
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [eh] chest <malay>aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau kena hempap</malay>
then <malay>dia macam</malay> !huh! <malay>aku tak bilang kau apa-apa apa</malay>
how you know
<malay>aku pun kena</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan lembaga besar</malay> [kan] <malay>mata merah</malay> !huh! <malay>kau pun kena aku dah selalu kena</malay> #wei#
ya so this so <malay>bermakna</malay> before she even tell that guy that guy already know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like [eh] maybe real #siot#
[kan]
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
(uh) ya same
[eh] you ask and then you say no right same I also did that <malay>siapa</malay> [sial] [eh] <malay>tak apa jangan jawab</malay>
