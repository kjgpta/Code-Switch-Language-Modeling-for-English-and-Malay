hello
yes
okay
so
!hais!
there goes our effort early
anyway
just
find something new then
okay [lah]
then [eh] I kept thinking about the hotel <malay>semalam</malay>
no [lah] as in for a staycation it's a nice place actually
although
not much that you can do in that #bugis# area
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> #fullerton# or #marina# bay sands at least you <malay>boleh turun</malay> and do some shopping
and not to forget
#sim lim# square
the
the mall that replaced #funan#
so lousy now
how can you turn an mall into a sports [ah] (ugh) I have no words for this
velocity
[eh] no I am just kid
yes [oh] the other time me and kevin we tried to go there <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dia tutup</malay>
[oh] is it is it that's why
<malay>dengan kawan dia mesti nak cium-cium ni</malay>
no [lah] the view up there is nice [lah] if only you can bring a drone but sadly you cannot cause parliament <malay>betul-betul dekat sebelah</malay>
parliament no [lah] not not that nice I think clarke quay is still nice <malay>pasal</malay> singapore river
and maybe #istana# <malay>lawa</malay>
ya you're not you're not supposed to fly like five or ten kilometers away from either these two places
maybe it's public safety and also like I think government property privacy [ah]
but which which hotel is it that's the problem you don't remember right
was it or only on mothership
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err)
<malay>surat khabar tak ada</malay>
as in like
facebook article
yes [a'ah]
I see
I think mothership is endorsed by government
I think so
(hmm)
(hmm) I believe so
do you know what's the
difference between SGAG and mothership
no idea
mothership creates good content
mic mic keep drop no but just
no but
they just make more good content
mic drop
no [lah] just cause they came up with the singaporean dream game
[meh]
(um) I don't think so I don't know [lah] see [lah] if not because nowadays I think we are more interested to play checkers
(um)
well <malay>wak wak</malay> is I mean he's a champion at checkers then also is my mum and my uncle
yeah
no [lah] nothing much to tell like I keep losing to them
in malay they <malay>panggil dam</malay> [ah]
(mm)
[oh] my goodness you're almost twenty eight years old you <malay>tak tahu</malay> chess
well
now you're today years old
chess <malay>ke</malay> the checker board
(uh) he doesn't have but we have
you never see before right
yeah
cause it's in the storeroom we didn't have a
the chess the the pieces so we never took it out
do you know how to play <malay>dam</malay>
wait
play <malay>dam</malay> or play dumb
excuse me
it's twelve forty three in the morning
so
how is it
okay <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
and now we're back
a cringe
hi
yes
[oh] yes
so basically
what it is is
you
instead of putting it in
all the boxes it at your side [eh]
<malay>apa dia buat</malay> is
you need to put the pieces
alternatively like if you are putting it at on all the black boxes put it on all the black boxes only don't need to work on the white
(mm)
yes [eh] but you can use either one [ah] either the black or the white [ah] but you cannot put on both colours
no if I put it on the black boxes you put it on the black boxes also
(mm)
and in chess you can move I think quite a few directions but for checkers or <malay>dam</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> move diagonally
but you can't move back you can only move forward
[eh] chess
[ah] chess
!alamak!
chess I'm not too sure
but diana I think
chess you can move like
front I think
or diagonal
but for
<malay>dam</malay> you need to move diagonally only but you can't move back
yes something new every day
