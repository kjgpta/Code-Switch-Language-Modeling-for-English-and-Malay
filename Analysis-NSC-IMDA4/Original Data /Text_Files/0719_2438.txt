<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>lapan bangsa</malay> from where

you only come out of your mum and dad
like you are only from your mum and dad [pe] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] like you want to <malay>kira</malay> your <malay>nenek moyang semua</malay>
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
<malay>tak ada kau kata</malay> like it's not (um)
(err)
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's <malay>punya</malay> race [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>kau kata</malay> like they shouldn't choose so
<malay>apa yang</malay>
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
like <malay>kalau</malay>
okay <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian [kan] like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial <malay>apa tu</malay> the quota that one right
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
cause like <malay>kalau</malay> this one
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>ramai gila cina</malay>
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian then <malay>kau</malay> identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
[a'ah] I I don't know if like we can <malay>jual</malay> like <malay>jual</malay> to <malay>melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>jual</malay> to india or not
then I know like you have to <malay>jual</malay> to like
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh) it's like a social social inequality cause <malay>kita</malay> minorities <malay>selalu</malay>
okay [ah] I don't want to say <malay>selalu</malay> cause it's too like absolute but
(uh)
(uh) <malay>banyak kali</malay>

!chey! <malay>dipinggir</malay> yes ya yes ya
ya <malay>dipinggir</malay> is like [ah] #macam# <malay>jadi</malay> outlier <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
ya
(um) honestly <malay>aku rasa</malay>
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> #macam#
cause <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> quota <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation [ah] cause like #macam#
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] woodlands confirm <malay>kampung melayu</malay> [sia] woodlands #yishun#
