what would be your perfect day plenty out from waking up to bed time

but three six five have you watched the three six five day
I did
and it's very disgusting
ya ya and then
okay and then what would you want to eat

<malay>orang</malay> #bule# is <malay>orang</malay> #ang moh#
<malay>orang putih</malay>
shit so basic
okay [lah] at least fusion
(um) a perfect day for me would be
I wake up early in the morning
so the day before that I would sleep at like ten
and then I wake up at like I don't know maybe seven thirty or eight
and then after that (um)
I will what's that
exercise
ideal [lah] ideal perfect day [ah]
and then after that later I will exercise
until like I don't know maybe nine

okay and then I just like you know stretching [ah] for like ten fifteen minutes you know cause healthy living [kan] and then (um) after that I do some stretching I was there I eat my breakfast I want like big breakfast you know
maybe <malay>nasi lemak ke</malay> (mm) I don't like <malay>mee rebus</malay> (um)
it's okay I need a calorie surplus anyway
and then after that (um) I I I eat maybe <malay>nasi lemak ke</malay> or (mm) I want <malay>kuih keria atau getas getas</malay>
ya [eh] <malay>sekarang aku aku cakap ni aku nak makan pisang goreng</malay> [seh]
(mm) and then after that later (um) or like maybe like a continental breakfast [lah] who knows (mm) if I if I want to but if I don't want to then I think <malay>nasi lemak</malay> is a good choice and then after that like around ten
or something and then after that later I go I don't know
I think I just wanna go out I just wanna go I'll go to like some garden or some park
walk walk #gai gai# you know with with my loved one ya my boo boo
ya actually I want to picnic but then twelve to picnic is too hot so we will you know walk walk things like that in the park and after that around twelve to like two and we lunch we talk we go cafe well you know ya friendship matching and then
and then after that and then like around three or four
and then after that we'll go to picnic [ah] we go pick me and after that we'll watch that sunset together [oh] that's so and then we will go picnic together and then after that later we
what's that
ya we just go picnic we watch sunset after sunset then we eat dinner and we eat dinner I would to eat steak though or #omakase# you know what's #omakase# basically like what's that
japanese <malay>punya</malay>
like dining
set how do I say it it's like course meal [ah] it's like japanese <malay>punya</malay> course meal ya no that [one] is #bento# this [one] is like so basically you just sit there you buy like this course meal so yours <malay>apa</malay> #bleh# your appetiser your starters then after that you have the main things like that after that until you get the dessert
ya maybe I want to try that
and then
after dinner we go home
ya we go home and then later we just wind down shower and then watch netflix and then just snuggle and then go to sleep
next question would be what (err) what is your biggest fear
[oh] [oh] my god that got deep real quick
<malay>dalam-dalam</malay>
okay it's not <malay>terlalu dalam</malay> [lah]
are you like disappointing people are you disappointing yourself
(mm) okay make sense
but then like
then how do you overcome that like
(mmhmm)
okay so why do you think is the root cause of your fear
(mmhmm)
okay and then after that
so you know where's the root cause so then how would you tackle that the root cause
insightful insightful
isn't that how do you not okay cause I mean like those like that expectations are like from people that you care
and then how do you not care
honestly just going to hell right now
not gonna lie like I I <malay>tak nak masuk neraka</malay>
and one one one year in there is like one day is like what eighty years or something [ah]
so (um) I <malay>takut</malay>
and then like they say like
what's that there's only two minor signs left till like the major signs for like the <malay>akhirat hari kiamat</malay> ya (uh) like what's that (um) you know in israel like the
and they say it's it's in israel but I don't know if it's in israel but like basically they say like the lake of #galilee# or something like that
ya it's gonna dry up
and then it's like it is drying up it's like they say is drying up I'm just like okay
<malay>mampus</malay> and then after that (err)
and then after that another sign is <malay>macam</malay>
the euphrates [ah]
getting gold or something like that and apparently the arabs are you know getting richer and stuff right so ya
[oh] my god legit
ya I tell you corona virus right is a muslim like social distancing then like halal gap to get no no drinking no clubbing no going out till late at night you know
anywhere you go you're checked you are tracked
like [ah] you know god is watching you actually (mm)
B B do you have protection it's okay safe entry
what !wow! !wow! !wow! relax
okay
I mean
I have to write <malay>taubat</malay>
as <malay>taubat</malay>
and then like (um)
#inshallah#
I <malay>doa</malay> I <malay>takkan jumpa</malay>
<malay>hari kiamat</malay>
#inshallah# to that
yes #inshallah# to that for both of us cause I don't want to be there when like all the major signs happen like
if like
the anti christ messiah or like #dajjal#
ya and like <malay>kalau dia datang</malay> [kan]
cause like
<malay>dia cuma takkan pergi dua tempat</malay> [jer] <malay>makkah atau madinah</malay>
and then like cause <malay>apa tu malaikat</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like guard the place [kan] so like I would want to go there
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean like obviously it's a it's gonna be a pandemic [what] everybody knows and then like
<malay>mampus</malay>
ya <malay>tak boleh pergi sana sebab semua orang macam</malay> like <malay>pergi sana</malay> and then you just over there like I cannot go there you know
and then the the thing is they say that
cause he
has like
ours <malay>macam tuhan</malay>
you know ya <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [sia] <malay>aku mana pergi madrasah</malay> [sia]
you know but then this [one] I I I I <malay>belajar bukan daripada madrasah</malay> honestly right <malay>madrasah</malay> it's like useless
we learn like I mean like
we we don't really learn about like the major signs we just learn like [oh] like some arab [lah] and then after that we learn like all like the signs and like the #hadith# and how to authenticity like that
ya but like I mean those are good those are useful [lah] but like what's that when they teach like things like for example like you know when you go overseas right do you travel and then you need to <malay>solat</malay> [kan] and then you <malay>solat</malay> like you #jamak# and then you will also like #takdim#
[kan]
like you #jamak takhir# #jamak takdim# ya so basically <malay>tu</malay> the <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>buat tu</malay> [kan] you <malay>apa tu</malay> like you combine you <malay>punya solat</malay>
(mm) so <malay>jadi macam zohor dengan asar</malay> you combine in a way <malay>jadi</malay> like
was that you
pray <malay>zohor</malay> during <malay>asar</malay> timing and <malay>asar</malay> during timing or <malay>zohor</malay> during <malay>zohor</malay> timing and
<malay>asar</malay> during <malay>zohor</malay> timing so you push back or push
or you bring forward like one of the prayers and then when you <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> meet right
you make it from like four <malay>rakaat</malay> to two <malay>rakaat</malay>
ya ya
and then like what's that (mm) some people ask him like how long can we do this and <malay>bila kita boleh buat</malay> you know
so it's like they teach [lah] but like the thing is the way they teach right it's like so one
way it's like there's no other way you just do this you just do what we tell you but then the thing is
there are so many other opinion opinions and thoughts like
what is that I don't like the way they teach
religion in like singapore
which is also why
!oops! if this [one] if I'm not gonna say later later <malay>mampus</malay>
ya <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
ya and then [oh] my god
you know what there's like drama at like my <malay>madrasah</malay>
there was drama cause like okay my <malay>ustaz</malay> apparently he got frustrated with like the
#mudirah# and the #mudirah# is like the principal [tau] <malay>dia marah dengan dia sebab apa</malay> like
what's that she
<malay>kalau dia cuma</malay> she doesn't she doesn't <malay>dia tak percaya siapa-siapa</malay> unless <malay>dia punya kaki</malay> [tau]
unless <malay>dia orang dia punya kaki baru dia percaya jadi</malay> like all the thing she asked to do she'll ask like the things that she the people that she trusts that she like
but then she doesn't like a lot of people that's a thing she only trust a few handful so all the things that like
what's that she supposed to delegate right all the work
she give it to the people she like and then those people whose job scope is the things that like
the the ones that like she give to other people it's like you're like what is going on ya
(mm)
I have no idea actually I didn't think that should be like that you know
but apparently she is
and then after that he and like my <malay>ustaz</malay> he <malay>macam</malay> he was like he texted us one day it's like hello <malay>korang korang boleh keluar ke tak</malay> like <malay>jumpa</malay> like
