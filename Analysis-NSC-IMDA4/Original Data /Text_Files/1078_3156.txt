okay <malay>boleh dengar</malay>
all right
ya
<malay>kalau tidak nanti</malay> it becomes distorted
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit [ah]
is it
okay okay then <malay>aku</malay> adjust
the boundary [ah] okay <malay>aku baru pasang</malay>
shit
I don't know what went wrong [ah] honestly [ah] honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic [ah] I was like
okay [lah] <malay>aku tak buat salah</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't see
even if I was the instructor
I wouldn't penalize myself (uh) just now [ah] maybe yesterday okay [lah] because yesterday <malay>aku macam kaku sikit</malay> because I didn't ride for very long right
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to [lah] but <malay>aku dah datang lambat semalam</malay>
<malay>semalam aku tak lambat</malay> so
then he started the face like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tahu macam oren penyet punya</malay> [kan] looking not happy like that so I was like okay [lah] I tell him I said okay I got experience like that (uh) (uh) <malay>kau</malay> experience <malay>kat mana aku cakap dulu</malay> I [oh] okay somebody go ask <malay>sampai</malay> back <malay>berapa</malay> then like (uh)
<malay>empat ke lima</malay> [ah] after second assessment
[oh] okay okay this one not for you go that one <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay>
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit [ah]
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike [ah]
and obviously I I kept stalling like I (um) not midway but I kept stalling at that place <malay>yang</malay> you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so <malay>dia macam</malay> when I'm moving then <malay>dia</malay> stall stall stall <malay>gitu</malay>
but apart from that
I think
I don't see anything wrong with it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know [ah] cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that <malay>aku bawa</malay> maybe thirty five [ah] thirty or thirty five [ah] it break <malay>dia punya</malay> speed [ah]
so the the problem was (uh) okay that that was yesterday so <malay>aku faham</malay>
and I accepted it [lah] ya but today
(um) I started out with the mini circuit
I made less than less than ten rounds [ah] it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was (um) <malay>dia cakap</malay> okay (uh) he put two people out
like it was me and it was that that that that girl [lah] so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance [ah] maybe today I might pass [ah] that kind of thing
but no
<malay>tak nak</malay> [lah]
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
fact ni <malay>cakap</malay> I didn't even stall today <malay>macam</malay> because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice <malay>kepala otak dia</malay> [lah] need more practice at least you come and tell me <malay>macam</malay> maybe I did something wrong maybe <malay>aku terlalu laju</malay> or <malay>aku macam</malay> maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know <malay>ini macam</malay> guessing game you know or not like [oh] I asked him I asked me just now I said [oh] actually what what went wrong like
!wah! <malay>tadi kau</malay> okay (uh) everything okay breaking okay <malay>tak macam semalam</malay> cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
then I said [oh] then
then why I cannot the same ride again [ah]
[oh] <malay>takde apa-apa kau</malay> just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking <malay>kepala otak kau kau pun</malay> every prac <malay>kau pegang motor ke sama juga</malay> [kan] it's the same it's the same model [what] it's the same bike [what] what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated [lah] at that point of time then I just [ah] ya you know <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
so
[oh] so that was me and then about that girl
she was (um) she was okay she she also failed
but <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> failure <malay>aku faham</malay> because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really <malay>tergolek</malay> you know <malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about [ah] okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not <malay>yang belakang yang</malay> that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is <malay>hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan</malay> admin <malay>punya</malay> side
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back [ha] so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
time <malay>belok</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> turning [ah] <malay>ada</malay> cornering [ah] so
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
I was in front of her so <malay>aku bawa</malay> okay everything <malay>semua</malay> okay so I already made one round already
and then
and then the instructor <malay>pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk</malay> she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there [lah]
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror [lah] but I won't speeding I won't because that part <malay>memang</malay> you have to go down to get to that turn [what]
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place [eh] I already down to gear two already even before that [ah]
then <malay>aku belok sekali ada</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku ingat dia tengah baring</malay>
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there [ha] my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that [lah] that's why he stood there
because the other places where you turn <malay>ada orang</malay> it's quite open but that particular corner is is is [ha] <malay>memang</malay> seclude you cannot see anything there [ah]
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
[ha] then the instructor was like (uh) <malay>apa kau buat lagi</malay> !alamak! <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> [kan] then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop [ah] stop and wait
then after that (uh) she was trying to pick up the mood
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you [ah] I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that [ah] so I guess <malay>takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke</malay>
no I was still on my bike
[ha] instructor instructor was there all the while [ha] so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say [eh] sorry [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> in your way I say nevermind it's okay [lah] you just
just do your thing [ah] then the instructor go and tell her some more you know [ha] <malay>masa dah buang ni lagi</malay>
[ha] you concentrate or your bike [ha] you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall [ah] because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver [lah] maneuver the the turn but she
she likes to <malay>macam himpit</malay> to the left side
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
[ha] cause it's it's a bend [what]
so no she probably got so close and after that she <malay>gabra</malay> because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
[ha] <malay>badan dia pula</malay> was on the other lane
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you <malay>kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia</malay>
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no [lah] I'm okay [lah] okay
and then after that (uh) she was trying to start the bike [ah] <malay>kelakar</malay> cause when she fell [kan] I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then <malay>apa</malay> she said [eh] (uh) I think my motorbike spoiled <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled <malay>dia ingat</malay> spoiled <malay>dia</malay> try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik [one] you cannot hear the engine starting [ah]
then after that like
!alamak! how <malay>ni</malay> [eh] <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then he go there he said this one your switch your switch [ha] check your switch okay
then <malay>dia</malay> begin
after that (uh) when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
(uh) the instructor tell me he said (uh)
<malay>takpe</malay> (uh) number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake <malay>takpe takpe takpe</malay> I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one [ah] so after that <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her [kan] he say you just go ahead first [ah]
so I was just riding and riding and riding <malay>macam</malay> no problem [lah] to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one <malay>yang pakai</malay> bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying [ah] tall guy malay
<malay>muka dia macam mat</malay> [sial] <malay>sikit dia dia</malay> was on the he was on the he was at the bend <malay>yang depan lagi</malay> before you turn back into the the the admin area <malay>dia jatuh</malay> part <malay>sini kira</malay> square
<malay>macam ni</malay> [kan] admin area <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] <malay>dia ada tempat sini si</malay> instructor <malay>lagi satu dia lepak sini</malay> the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>buat apa</malay> you're already breaking already [what] I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
<malay>macam</malay> you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice [ah] turn and like <malay>salah salah kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi</malay> brake brake <malay>sebelum kau</malay> down gear brake <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>apa</malay> [lah] [siol] so
at that point of time the more he talk the more <malay>aku</malay> #peng# [ah] but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three <malay>tudung</malay> girls in his class
[ha] prac one
<malay>tapi dia orang baru nak keluar</malay> [ah] so
<malay>aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa</malay> [ah] just want to start one again ya I guess normal [leh] you know whatever [lah] [eh]
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
for me [lah] as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong <malay>dia suruh aku main</malay> one two one two one two three <malay>aku</malay> one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
<malay>jadi</malay>
when I got the results I was like
the fuck [sial]
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
[ha] plank plank quite <malay>senang</malay> [what]
no to me
really [meh] you use your foot brake [what]
really
!huh!
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
[oh] class two ten seconds slower [ah]
[ha]
but I still remember two B in seven seconds <malay>tak salah aku</malay> is fast [lah] let me class to you have to go thanks again [eh]
but you but on on on gear one right
ya [lah] half clutch ya actually can [what]
is it
serious [ah]
[ah]
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know [oh] bobber bike [kan] that one [ah] the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country [eh] is it mutt [ah]
(mm)
confirm [ah]
[ah]
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred [ah]
ya [lah] that's why
ya I saw I saw it (uh) <malay>tak salah aku nampak dekat mana</malay> [eh]
bikes is it was it bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
(mm)
!huh! who
[oh]
#sanfu# [ah]
#paya lebar#
for the mutt the mutt [ah] how much
excluding
machine price
[oh] inclusive [a'ah]
last year's was how much
ten thousand plus
[ha]
that bike is expensive [ah]
zontes cheaper [ah]
!huh! the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening [ha]
sell out your bike first
(mm)
(mm)
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think that you should consider that
you don't upgrade now [lah] #dol# you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten <malay>ke</malay> something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once <malay>kau dah</malay>
confident once <malay>kau rasa macam</malay> you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike [ha] that is five six years later you you change [ah] you don't have to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I get class two <malay>sekarang juga aku nak tukar</malay> [ha]
there are many people who have class two bikes [ah]
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is [ah] on the roads [ah] that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred (hmm) (mm)
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but ya (um) then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the <malay>lampu</malay>
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
<malay>sama aja</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[ah]
is it
ya
!huh!
per two weeks
[oh] engine oil to [oh] you change [ah] ya that's about two weeks [lah]
sixty
[oh] ya ya ya (mmhmm)
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four bottles <malay>mampus mampus</malay>
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
(mm)
ya [lah] because you got to change it frequently <malay>apa</malay>
forty eight ya
for every
[ah]
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer [ah] get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
(uh)
have [what] [ah] three ten is is <malay>pendek</malay> [what]
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten <malay>cantik</malay> [sia]
it's nice
it looks like bro
[eh] but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
the <malay>yang</malay> one ninety
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger (uh)
the the the the <malay>apa</malay> the capacity capacity I think is
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five [oh] but
<malay>dia punya</malay> tank [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
fifteen I think sixteen litres [ah]
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
ya but the thing is a zontes <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>misal kata</malay> if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike <malay>mampus ke apa ke kat sana</malay> bro I'm dead [sia]

you know it's not like you know like before
you can literally book everyday you know ya bro but that point of time I was still young I have no money so <malay>aku</malay> once in two weeks <malay>baru pergi</malay>
ya
you finish the next one once <malay>kau dah habis</malay> prac <malay>kau turun</malay> [eh] last time not <malay>turun</malay> last time it was the same level
you just finished it you go to the kerb you can book the next one <malay>kalau ada</malay> slot [lah]
[ha] and last time I [ha] and last time
the the chances of people sending their their their their slots like very high like everyday be lazy [what]
so
even when I was
even when I continued doing (uh) when in woodlands when I was staying at chinatown
<malay>pun ada juga</malay> I remembered my prac two and prac three was on the same day
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> I book prac two (uh) in the afternoon I think it was one plus I finished my prac I pass I went to I went to different one
and that was about four plus so by the time <malay>ayah aku ambil aku</malay> was I remember was about seven plus
<malay>mati balik rumah ni</malay> [tau]
it's possible [lah]
but on that day there also three point two <malay>yang</malay> fail
I remember three point two E brake [ah]

fail
brake <malay>aku</malay> brake [ah] <malay>pakai dua-dua</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay> jammed <malay>apa</malay>
no I think (uh) exceeded the line got exceeded the line

so by the time <malay>aku</malay> [ah]
so by the time <malay>aku dah nak sampai</malay> yellow light all I have to do is I just have to stop locating and then steer back down my my rear and and and front brake
the back also

but #dayah# ruby all went before her
first round of of of retrenchment #dayah# was the head of customer service [ah]
my head [lah] if she head of customer service [sial] [lah] no professionalism [sial] <malay>si bengap tu</malay>
[ah]
we used to order [lah] we used to order for dinner
after nine plus
eleven you are entitled to <malay>makan</malay> fifty dollars
per person ya
okay
normal [lah]
(mm) (mm)
now
is
clear cut dishonesty [sia]
terrible [ah]
of course [ah]
[ah]
you told me this one you told me
this one you told me but when was this this year
#dayah# smoke or no
I never seen her smoke ruby smokes #dayah# I don't know
I never see but #dayah# always try to act like the <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> in the office I cannot I cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
I really cannot <malay>tahan lagi dengan dia punya muka dengan dia punya</malay>
maybe [ah] <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> makeup <malay>dengan dia punya bontot gitu</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [sia]
I mean you know honestly what [lah] just she's just
[kan] I told I told #shida# and her off before [what] #shida# and ruby off before at the office I think that from there already they won't come in I say you all you all treat the office like a playground
you know I never saw them in the corporate world
(mm)
but long time ago you still there [lah]
but I think on the day you were not working I I I didn't like #shida# from day one [one]
to me #shida# is just
a nuisance
I don't know how she was in youtrip [ah] but in deliveroo she was terrible
character wise
but ya [lah] that's the that's the that's the whole
and then rational why I I kind of didn't really like
I mean
I took that job because
and I came back from europe I had no job like literally nothing
ya no actually I ask you for it because you actually told me about the job before I went to europe and I said I don't want [ah] I said I didn't want cause you join them a few months (uh) two months before me nevermind <malay>aku cakap dengan kau aku tak nak</malay> [kan] I said don't want [lah] okay [lah] to me if that customer is <malay>dayah kau</malay> stay away from me [lah]
but when I came back to singapore I was like what to do <malay>aku takde duit</malay> [sia] then I was like work or not to work work on to work <malay>nak duit</malay> [ah]
then I message sophia <malay>tanya dia ada lubang ke tak</malay> but <malay>apa</malay> [tau] they were teasing you also like you said you forward it to keith and then I was asking you I say that this will get back to you and he say no whatever
then after that and then you give me keith's number then when I call keith ask me to come down come down <malay>bukan</malay> interview [sia] <malay>aku datang terus kerja</malay>
and then I'm like [ah] then I had to sign the the the stupid !huh! no last time attendance [kan] sign that that paper right what the the one in the hut the hut the hut
whatever [lah]
then I <malay>siap macam kena</malay> interview but he never interviewed until like one month later
(mm)
that's why ruby tried to start <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> with me but I was I wasn't really interested [ah] like ruby <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] when I came into the office already and someone was it was I remember someone when I came in like eleven o'clock shift or something like that <malay>kau dapat dalam</malay>
and then (um) I was sitting beside
(um) sophia B
then
sophia at that point of time I saw okay [lah] not bad [lah] at that point of time [ah] the woman <malay>dia buka dia punya mulut aku dah</malay> [ah] fuck man [ah] so <malay>aku macam</malay> [siol] [ah]
I don't know [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> pitching <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> the way she talks quite irritating <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku</malay> just
the the random on that very first day of work [eh] <malay>lepas tu dia cakap jom hisap rokok aku tak nak</malay> sophie I say after lunch [lah] it's like [eh] <malay>jom hisap rokok turun</malay> the first she say
<malay>kau nak mati</malay>
ya I don't have I'm like
<malay>aku rasa aku ada</malay> [ah] during that time <malay>aku dengan erin dah dah dah</malay> on the rock <malay>aku rasa aku ada rasa</malay> [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I say no [lah] no [lah] I have I have
I just don't think my relationship will last [ah] then she was like [oh] take it slow take slow everybody got their hard place <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at that point <malay>dia punya laki masih kat dalam</malay>
<malay>sekarang aku tak tahu</malay>
where is she you also don't know where [ah]
<malay>sebab dia gila pangkat</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia gila pangkat</malay> but she's very she's very [ah] subtle [leh] cannot really predict what she's going to do <malay>dia</malay> very quiet <malay>tapi dia punya orang</malay> she knows want she wants and then she'll slowly #shida# told you [oh] and then she go and ya she told me she told me
then you telling me [one] <malay>kau tak boleh</malay> trust how the ya you told me I remember you had some issues before <malay>rabak</malay> [kan] <malay>aku pernah cakap dengan kau</malay> never ever trust anybody
