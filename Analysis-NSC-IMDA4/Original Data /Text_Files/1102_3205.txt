[eh] then you pass by so fast [eh]
don't you think so like with COVID like !wow! where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling [eh] do you miss travelling
ya but if (mm) you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to (uh)
(um) like before COVID [lah]
new
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!
[eh] so was the first time that you felt snow or <malay>macam</malay> how was it [ah] <malay>macam sejuk gila ke</malay> or like how was it
[ah] K
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester
we were so noob man
okay can you jog my memory again york <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
okay [lah] just want to check it out while we are there <malay>betul aqilah</malay>
so right what [eh] did we go to any theme parks [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay> like I can't remember like during our trip
trying to recall [lah]

enchanted garden or something
<malay>yang ada</malay> the one with the that float what do you call it [ah]
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what is it called [ah]

ya and then (um)
ya I just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
not not rafting [ah] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
[oh] then <malay>kita ada masuk tu</malay> haunted house haunted house
[kan] <malay>ada macam tempat</malay> I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip <malay>dekat sana</malay> then <malay>ada</malay> this little like haunted house <malay>yang kita masuk</malay>
<malay>kat atas</malay> [ah] like this house of mirrors or something like that
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
(err) no [ah] bondi [ah] bondi <malay>kat</malay> australia
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
(mm) we really miss the nature [ah]
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall [ah]
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania [what]
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya it can layer on <malay>lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>kat dalam</malay> forests <malay>kena</malay> layer on [seh]
ya but okay [lah] I mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches

unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have (uh) know two thousand maybe
<malay>bila</malay> [seh] how come I don't know
<malay>ni</malay> time uni [eh]
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
but (err) <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean <malay>macam</malay> you've got to plan around your budget and everything [kan]
<malay>jauh gila</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>sabar</malay> belgium is germany right
[oh] okay okay and then <malay>apa jadi</malay>
and then
so wait the cab fare was <malay>mahal gila</malay> or what
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
#ish# <malay>rabak</malay> or what
!huh!
so basically you were trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
[eh] wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ke kau orang macam</malay> were I don't know just winging it
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
<malay>ada</malay> buffer [lah]
this was towards the end of your trip or <malay>macam mana</malay>
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] <malay>takde duit apa</malay> [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay> K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your <malay>alasan</malay>
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he <malay>kena</malay> switched on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter [ah]
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because I'm just wondering <malay>macam</malay> you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm <malay>tengah</malay> panic [eh] <malay>pasal macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat</malay> then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
<malay>macam macam</malay> what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
<malay>ada raih tak kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] spain <malay>menang</malay>
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like <malay>habis</malay>
people will probably be like <malay>maki-maki semua</malay>
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] <malay>kena jalan balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>jalan balik lepas tu</malay>
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] <malay>roti</malay> and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
<malay>prata</malay> [eh]
<malay>prata</malay> is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait <malay>sabar sabar kau orang dah</malay> check <malay>harga benda tu ke belum</malay>
okay okay <malay>habis</malay>
alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]
