[eh]
shut up
we were together for seven months
actually no [ah] not even one year but it was nice and we didn't fight at all I think once or twice

then
then after that (um) then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay [ah] I I mean can just okay then we <malay>keluar</malay> together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after (uh) secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing <malay>hijab</malay> fully [what]
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear <malay>hijab</malay> and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
that kind of
thing ya so after that
[eh] I haven't talk about #azri#
later later okay then after that [oh] #haikal#
#haikal# now with another girl that time <malay>kat</malay> #paya# #paya lebar# <malay>kita nampak dia</malay> [pe]
ya #haikal# don't know [lah] he
ya
actually you you can sense
ya
but he has nice fashion sense
sense
fashion sense
then #afiq#
[oh] that #afiq# was a nice story cause (um) we met through #hakim# then okay so basically (uh) okay so I took for my
then after that (um) that time I only saw #hakim# one time
ya then you know when
ya
I actually
#afiq# didn't know at all
<malay>siapa</malay> no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
I think ya ya ya
ya
but then the thing is they are both different like if you see us in person we are very different people I very talkative he's not he's very like
what okay but he's not okay no he's not at all actually he's
he's more noisier than me
okay ya I was the talkative but as far as I know now he talks more than I do like everytime I want to talk he's like he has his own opinion then he's like then I'm like let me talk no but is is good [lah] that he talks now like he is very comfortable with me now
ya
six months together but we dated before that four to five months
ya ya we very long I mean I I can see me in it myself with him for a very long time ya
then after that
he got three other siblings
ya
I don't know #allah# open my heart no legit
no no
I didn't I didn't felt that cause I know I was too young even think about marriage
with #izzat# I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with #afiq# like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like <malay>nak tengok rambut</malay> pay more runway or something the whole time he that [one]
is the ya but it's very <malay>apa</malay> [oh] ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that [one] they don't care that kind of thing
ya and then like #izzat# insist and then it was very like there wasn't really a lot of respect
no he didn't want no he's a very picky guy like he wanted you know all his friends thought that he would end up end up with like some cafe girl chinese cafe girl that kind of thing
then like <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> cafe
ya
ya and <malay>dia kerja</malay> cafe <malay>sekarang</malay> actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even <malay>pandang orang bertudung</malay>
ya
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say [oh] you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better [lah] like he don't straightforward say because he try to <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>hati</malay> at first he don't know how to <malay>jaga hati perempuan</malay> then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
no
I just like I just talk to him normally okay I didn't like go to sensitive topics
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like <malay>kenapa marah</malay> I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends <malay>cakap</malay> that there is <malay>banyak</malay> difference from him <malay>dulu</malay> and <malay>sekarang</malay> ya which is good [lah] then after that from that like [eh] this guy is different like really really different from my exes
ya
<malay>kau</malay> what about your exes
you you only have one ex
time to get much
ya
ya
no but you're damn picky I doubt so you want to know the guy one to two years before having something
I think she want to <malay>elak</malay> I think she want to <malay>elak</malay> like to touch each other cause it's <malay>haram</malay> to do so
#mira filzah# the type <malay>kuat agama</malay> type [what]
