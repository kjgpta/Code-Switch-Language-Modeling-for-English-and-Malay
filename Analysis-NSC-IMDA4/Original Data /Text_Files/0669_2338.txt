!woohoo!
let's go hello
(mmhmm)
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
(mmhmm)
(oo)
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya (um) I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams <malay>cita-cita saya nak pergi ke</malay> australia <malay>untuk</malay> continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about <malay>keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat</malay> important
a bit of both
<malay>pasal kalau ibu</malay> (um) <malay>susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya</malay> cause <malay>saya anak yang paling</malay> last
so for <malay>ayah</malay>
<malay>ayah</malay> is quite easy you know
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
you know but like when I was supposed to go <malay>saya</malay> not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
how do I do
(oo)
so <malay>tak boleh yang</malay> typical <malay>macam</malay> invisible
(oo) <malay>tu susah</malay>
okay <malay>awak awak jawab dulu</malay>
ya
okay <malay>awak nak jadi macam</malay> spy kids [lah]
(mmhmm) <malay>masukkan makanan dalam</malay> oven <malay>terus</malay> boom <malay>dah siap</malay> is it
<malay>awak tak sangka</malay> [kan] <malay>tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu</malay>
that's a good superpower
(oo)
saves time
ya
<malay>makanan yang ringkas</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah]
!wow!
I've never thought of that
as you got !wow! now after we think ya <malay>masa tengah fikir ni</malay>
<malay>apa jawapan saya</malay>
unusual
#allah# <malay>ada</malay> timing [eh] okay
(oo)
ten years ago <malay>saya dapat jumpa sekarang</malay>
[kan] <malay>yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang</malay> okay
<malay>saya akan dapat jumpa</malay>
<malay>gambar-gambar lama</malay>
ya <malay>pasal saya suka</malay> collect <malay>gambar-gambar lama</malay>
ya <malay>sama macam ibu</malay> collect collect collect
then I think
(uh) first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
<malay>pasal kecil benda tu</malay>
ten years ago (oo)
<malay>dua puluh tiga sekarang jadi</malay>
(mm) <malay>tiga belas</malay> ya
<malay>saya tengah</malay> secondary one
right
!wow!
!wow! ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
<malay>kita macam budak baik dulu</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> [jer] cause
[ah] cause after second year third year <malay>habis</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I think that is peer pressure
[kan]
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
<malay>sama-sama</malay> [lah] <malay>kita macam</malay>
<malay>nak buat kawan susah</malay> [lah]
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
<malay>tak buat apa-apa pun</malay> ya <malay>pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai</malay> telephone
<malay>jujur</malay>
<malay>siapa yang tak pernah tidur dalam kelas</malay>
ya <malay>tapi saya tak boleh tidur</malay> often it's cause
(uh) student leader <malay>saya</malay> student leader
ya <malay>saya</malay> student leader
<malay>dalam sekolah</malay>
(oo)
[oh] you call it monitor in your school
<malay>tapi</malay> in your secondary school
class chair
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
they have different ya
(mmhmm)
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I [oh] ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it (um) have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two (uh) different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic (um) just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student (um) leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had (um) the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
<malay>sekolah yang paling tinggi</malay> cause my school is more of a like a music school
and we are good with (uh) literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
(mmhmm)
of course
(mm)
<malay>siapa yang suka</malay> first of all
<malay>siapa yang suka</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
like a stable right
ya
ya <malay>saya kena</malay> (um) bully about my looks
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
<malay>macam</malay> compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause <malay>dia macam</malay> carefree at that point
right you <malay>macam tak kisah</malay>
<malay>pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam</malay> it's okay
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat (um) sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
<malay>saya kecewakan keluarga saya</malay>
<malay>mengecewakan</malay>
<malay>cis</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya
(mm)
in school
(oo)
<malay>dalam sekolah apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>saya paling suka</malay> during <malay>saja</malay>
yes
<malay>makanan</malay> is
something else
simple <malay>makanan</malay> simple
like it's cause <malay>tak mahal</malay>
<malay>nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat</malay> but
!wow!
<malay>kau pergi</malay> east [kan]
the best
(mmhmm)
<malay>warung</malay>
ya
ya
ya
<malay>ada benda dua dolar</malay>
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
<malay>jawapan saya</malay> is the <malay>dua</malay> dollar
chicken wrap
<malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde</malay>
[dah] <malay>tutup</malay> it's cause before I graduate I heard that (uh) they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall <malay>tu dengan</malay> bubble tea I <malay>ingat</malay>
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
<malay>saya tak</malay> fan
ya
<malay>itu yang belakang</malay> drink stall [eh]
[kan]
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
(oo) ya
ya
fragrant
(oo)
<malay>saya terlupa</malay>
ya
the #ramen# the japanese #ramen# that's my number one
[ah] that's good #ramen# there's the
end stall that's why
ya I remember I asked them before maggi <malay>apa dia orang pakai</malay> just cause
<malay>nak</malay> try <malay>buat kat dalam kat rumah</malay>
<malay>tapi pernah buat rasa dia lain</malay>
<malay>macam tak boleh</malay> make it <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>saya rasa saya</malay> chef bob <malay>awak rasa</malay>
<malay>awak</malay> chef #wan# <malay>saya rasa saya tak mampu</malay>
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also #kimchi# #ramen#
the beef
#ramen#
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
and you know me <malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> I I <malay>makan</malay> [jer]
I <malay>tak tanya apa benda saya makan</malay> [jer]
I mean
as long as halal
<malay>kadang-kadang pun saya tak tanya kalau benda tu halal ke tak</malay>
#inshallah# <malay>benda tu</malay> halal #inshallah# <malay>tu</malay> halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
(oo)
we're sticking to that [oh] my god ya
ya
(oo) <malay>soalan yang susah</malay>
!wow! sensitive question <malay>dia</malay>
sensitive
ya
perspectives
(mmhmm)
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
(um) bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
(uh) <malay>waktu</malay> secondary school [kan]
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
!wow! I know I am I <malay>macam macam-macam</malay> [lah] since [ah] <malay>macam macam macam dari</malay> primary school it's if primary school I
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
(oo) don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
<malay>saya tengah fikir balik apa saya buat dulu</malay>
[ah]
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
(um) which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
(uh) and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same [what] like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
it's like netball <malay>sama dia punya</malay> rules is <malay>sama macam</malay> netball
exactly the same <malay>cuma dia punya</malay> (um) the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
ya very complicated <malay>tapi saya buat</malay> and then I also did
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies (uh) I remember one time
(um) <malay>benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya</malay>
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
I <malay>nak beli air</malay>
cause it's recess time of course <malay>saya nak beli air</malay> so I <malay>pergi</malay> canteen <malay>seorang-seorang</malay>
<malay>beli air terus ada</malay> this random girl came
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like (um) she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
(um)
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
and then I look at her cause I <malay>macam</malay> lost [kan] <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>dia ni berbual</malay>
<malay>saya tengok dia</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh! and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like !huh! what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
okay after that <malay>selepas itu dia buat lagi</malay> and <malay>lepas tu dia buat</malay> publicly
<malay>dia depan-depan orang</malay> you know but after she did that she walked away [eh] no and then she said (uh) pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
<malay>saya macam tercungap tu</malay> [kan] so I <malay>tak tahu nak buat apa</malay>
so I just <malay>masuk dalam kelas balik</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> just doze off cause
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ingat</malay> like myspace blogspot was a thing
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
<malay>abeh macam tadi</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] student
council you're the thing you're popular but
<malay>tak</malay> necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause <malay>kalau</malay> adulthood we don't usually care about people right
<malay>kita pergi kita bangun mandi pergi kerja balik</malay>
ya
if <malay>dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual</malay> you know what I mean
but <malay>bila</malay> secondary school it's hard cause you have to
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
!wow!
[orh]
<malay>soalan apa susah lagi</malay> <malay>saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir</malay>
<malay>lepas ni ada rambut putih macam mana</malay>
!wow!
one wish
I would say
just give myself confidence <malay>pasal kalau pasal saya</malay> insecure
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity <malay>saya rasa macam</malay> everything is gonna be okay
I will go through it you know
ya
no <malay>saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa</malay>
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
(uh) <malay>suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
everything is <malay>susahnya soalan awak</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>bosan</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
<malay>soalan</malay>
<malay>kalau tak perlu cari duit duit datang dari mana</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi duit ada</malay>
I've been talking
[oh]
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
(oo)
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>agak bosan</malay> cause you're not content
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right (oo)
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but (oo)
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay [ah] I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
(uh) plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
(um) you don't have any commitment to something
so <malay>dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
<malay>awak kata soalan ni tak susah macam mana ni</malay>
<malay>saya rasa saya</malay> overthinker
<malay>tempat pertama</malay>
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
you know I <malay>tukar jawapan</malay> I I actually <malay>nak cakap</malay> #bali#
cause #bali# [eh] #bali# balling okay
#bali# balling <malay>tempat</malay> #bali# is everything that you
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm #jumeirah#
ya

yes
that's why I want to go there
<malay>kita</malay> scared of height

level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
(oo)
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
<malay>tinggi sangat</malay>
<malay>lagi rumah awak punya</malay> (um) <malay>yang</malay> wall <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kat luar rumah</malay> it's not like a sturdy one you know actually you know

<malay>tapi rumah makcik saya</malay>
<malay>rumah dia dekat</malay> #toa payoh# so like the
the floor [kan] it's not like the straight
walkway [tau] it's <malay>senget</malay> so you're going down and the wall
(uh) the side wall it's actually very <malay>rendah</malay> like your
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me

<malay>nanti dia kasih</malay> you <malay>makanan lain</malay> [jer] you <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sebulan tak makan</malay>
okay
(mmhmm)
in specific
(mmhmm)
generally
drama
<malay>itu awak</malay> everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
it's you I
(mm) you <malay>tahu</malay> I I <malay>tak suka</malay> movies <malay>sangat</malay>
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
<malay>romantis</malay>
I like romance
<malay>tak tahu saya cuma saya suka</malay> falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you <malay>tahu</malay> (um) nicholas sparks movies <malay>macam macam gitu</malay> favourite <malay>saya</malay>
<malay>saya dah tengok</malay>
movie <malay>dia banyak kali</malay>
<malay>saya tak bosan</malay>
<malay>tak bosan</malay> just
[oh] you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
is <malay>cerita</malay> white chicks
ya
<malay>itu</malay> favourite
I remember script <malay>dia semua</malay>
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty [kan]
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
(mm)
but <malay>tak tak macam seram ke</malay>
that's the thing I don't like to watch
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
(mm)
what's the craziest (um) <malay>cerita paling</malay>
<malay>yang seram</malay> I wouldn't say <malay>seram</malay>
but something that really shook you up
[oh] ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
money
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
<malay>konon macam</malay> alien <malay>ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak</malay>
you know what I mean
<malay>tak semestinya kalau kita tak nampak dia takde</malay>
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
!wow! <malay>kita tengok banyak cerita</malay> zombie [tau]
apocalypse
how
[ah]
ya
infected
<malay>soalan awak</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
(um)
<malay>manusia</malay>
!wow!
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things <malay>saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> anxiety [tau] ya cause
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but (um) how would we end humankind
I think virus <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
<malay>sekarang kita</malay> COVID [jer] [kan]
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
although in singapore they only say like <malay>macam</malay>
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
I'm so sorry <malay>saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang tapi</malay> ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
but like how long could that last
and how long could this (um) virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly !wow!
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya
(oo) fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
and find ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually we did though remember <malay>dulu kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> SARS
<malay>tapi</malay> SARS <malay>tak teruk macam gitu</malay> although <malay>enam tahun</malay> [kan] if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
it's not mandatory
ya although even (uh) during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
cause I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um) whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of (um) like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
or <malay>yang bagus</malay>
ya <malay>awak ni pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>buat soalan macam gini</malay>
(uh) <malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>apa yang saya boleh buat</malay>
is
(hmm)
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
cause <malay>untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini</malay>
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where (um)
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through

for the rest of my life
<malay>makan yang sama selama-lamanya</malay>

<malay>awak pandai</malay> [lah]
ya
boil
(oo) [oh] ya
ya
I think
<malay>saya pilih ikan</malay>
<malay>awak dah cakap gitu saya tukar jawapan saya</malay>
<malay>sebenarnya saya nak cakap</malay> pasta <malay>tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula</malay>
[a'ah] [eh]
[ah] <malay>saya buat</malay> pasta
<malay>awak buat daging</malay>
<malay>sedih nah</malay> <malay>tapi sedih juga kalau hari-hari</malay>

<malay>macam cara kita</malay> [kan] chef #wan# <malay>dengan</malay> chef bob

karma
<malay>kifarah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> get
ya
what goes around comes around
(oo) <malay>kifarah apa</malay>
<malay>kifarah</malay> [kan] <malay>dalam bahasa kita kifarah</malay>
(uh) <malay>saya rasa rasa</malay>
(oo) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] cause
we always tend to think the best of yourself
<malay>betul tak</malay>
you <malay>tak akan fikir buruk pasal tentang tentang diri</malay> you <malay>sendiri</malay>
you confirm <malay>cakap macam</malay> you <malay>baik dengan orang macam gini tapi saya rasa</malay>
<malay>sebaik kita ada buruk</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
[oh]
<malay>tapi tu ada sebab</malay>
[oh] karma
<malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>jawapan yang</malay>
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
<malay>saya buka</malay> main door
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think I <malay>buka</malay> I think a few times !chey! <malay>nak cakap saya baik</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi tak</malay> [lah]
I think ya
yours
<malay>dia fikir pasal tu pula</malay>
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
[oh] you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(oo)
[oh] we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
I want to say good looks <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>awak nampak</malay>
like <malay>macam</malay> very presentable
<malay>kalau</malay> presentable <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>badan yang sihat</malay>
I'd prefer (oo) <malay>susah kalau diri sendiri</malay> I prefer <malay>badan sihat</malay>
of course
<malay>saya sekarang</malay> [jer] <malay>jalan tercungap-cungap</malay>
<malay>saya muda tapi badan macam dah orang tua gitu</malay>
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
<malay>kesihatan kesihatan</malay> is everything
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
you <malay>nampak macam</malay> you <malay>muda tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>jalan sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>dah penat</malay>
what's the point
what's the point ya
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>asyik nak main</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting [jer]
ya <malay>mak</malay> you <malay>muda</malay> [eh]
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
!wow!
ya
I know what you gonna say <malay>saya dah tahu dah apa awak cakap</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> partner <malay>awak cari apa</malay>
[oh] no <malay>apa</malay>
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
that I'm not doing is eating I've been eating <malay>macam-macam saya makan</malay> [lah] <malay>saya tak</malay>
<malay>saya tak tengok</malay> portion <malay>apa saya</malay> just <malay>makan</malay>
ya <malay>siapa kisah</malay>
<malay>saya makan</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>ada macam-macam baru makan</malay>
<malay>nanti seminit lagi saya</malay> (um)
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
to exercise <malay>tapi nawaitu saya</malay> is to exercise
<malay>saya nak bersenam saya betul saya nak bersenam</malay>
yes
really hard but ya
<malay>awak buat kelakar sekarang</malay>
<malay>saya</malay> gain weight
<malay>saya tahu awak saya kenal awak saya</malay> gain weight like crazy
like it's just cause I'm small
<malay>badan saya kecil dengan saya nak cakap saya tak tinggi tak tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] but
<malay>sedang-sedang sahaja badan tapi kalau saya</malay> step on the weighing scale
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
I'm like fifty five <malay>apa ni saya macam</malay>
<malay>ini</malay> weighing scale <malay>yang salah ke saya yang bersalah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>saya rasa ada macam cara nak</malay>
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like (um) the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious [lah]
<malay>gabung</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>jalan dengan dia</malay>
<malay>kawan-kawan dia macam</malay> [oh] my god #huda#
<malay>semua nak</malay> [seh]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [eh]
so you <malay>nak</malay> maid [lah]
or is it you <malay>nak pembantu rumah</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
!wow!
!wow!
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
<malay>saya rasa macam gitu</malay>
cause <malay>muka saya dah kering jadi saya macam</malay> insecure <malay>sikit</malay>
ya of course
(mm)
<malay>saya tak nak jadi</malay> materialistic
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
(mmhmm)
ya
like a space is what you need
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
<malay>saya rasa pasal dengan</malay>
<malay>awak lihat kawan-kawan sekeliling</malay>
<malay>awak rasa macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay>
<malay>saya tak ada</malay>
or <malay>dia orang ada ni saya tak ada</malay>
although <malay>awak ada apa yang dia orang tak ada awak tak akan</malay>
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence
