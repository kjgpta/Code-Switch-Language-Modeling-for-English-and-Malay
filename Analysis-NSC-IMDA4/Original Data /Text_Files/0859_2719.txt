so that was quite like close to my heart [lah]
like (mm) [oh] my god I'm gonna cry like (err) I incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit [lah] like he always like offered me
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my <malay>datuk</malay> like (um)
he
he always like (uh) <malay>cakap</malay> like

I will <malay>makan</malay> it with Milo or like or like <malay>minum teh gitu</malay> then I will eat the <malay>biskut</malay> together
ya so
that <malay>biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah]</malay> with my <malay>datuk</malay> so I used the <malay>biskut</malay> as the background of the painting then (uh) for the forefront of the painting like I put (uh) my sofa all like from the living room
and also (err)
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like (uh) our expressions were like sad [lah] to show
like tribute <malay>gitu</malay>
and for the sofa pillows [kan] like
(uh)
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that (uh) I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like (uh) apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took (uh) O level art (um) it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork [ah] it was it was like mostly about my hair [lah] about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like (uh) previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
(uh) for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot
also I I I I joined a art competition like my school's art competition [lah] like it's being held from
like (err) (err)
like sketch club [ah]
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really <malay>rindu</malay> art [lah]
so ya
ya for sure and I've been lazy
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people <malay>yang macam</malay>
they <malay>ada</malay> then (uh) like they
<malay>letak</malay> like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked [ah] but then they are like very <malay>bagus</malay> in their
true true
word of the day <malay>penat</malay>
yes
just high [ah]

it's very <malay>macam</malay>
like content heavy [kan]
true true
ya
just polytechnic life

(mm)
I see
I see
actually ya
ya I'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy [lah]
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like (err)
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university [lah]
then (uh) let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool [lah]
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work [orh]
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
(mm)
<malay>tapi sekarang susah</malay> [lah] because (uh) COVID ya then <malay>banyak orang</malay>
that <malay>masuk</malay> that programme <malay>jadi</malay> to have something to fall back on
because the pay for it is
still
legit [lah] compared to like having <malay>tak ada kerja langsung</malay> [kan]
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave [kan]
ya
like
true
imagine those <malay>lagi</malay> like
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive [seh]
true
ya
but that's so bad [lah] obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens

confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> cool
okay [lah] that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school

<malay>macam rendam kat dalam air ke apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya buah dia</malay> like

<malay>satu minggu</malay> [jer]
really

(mm)
(mm)
[oh] [ah]
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
(ugh) (uh) is this a question
[oh] okay okay [ah] change the world I don't know [oh] my god I want to be more environment friendly [oh] my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like (uh)
like I join [ah] then I went to this
this (uh)
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like [oh] it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like (uh)
stands for bring your own bag like (uh)
they held this thing like (uh) we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that (err) we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then (um) we will take out those (uh) which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then (uh) we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags [ah] so it was quite so it's a
(uh) then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption [lah]
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like <malay>macam</malay>
singapore <malay>cuba</malay> try
to
<malay>jadi macam</malay> more environment friendly
like
I don't know <malay>dia orang buat</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> certain
like they implement like certain things [ah] to make it better
like I think the like #pulau semakau# like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast [ah] then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
just rich like <malay>dia orang rasa</malay> like that <malay>sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu</malay> so <malay>dia orang macam</malay> [oh] just <malay>bayar</malay> it <malay>gitu</malay>
so like they will still <malay>bayar</malay> it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents [kan] confirm <malay>orang macam lagi terasa macam</malay> like [oh] my god that is like <malay>duit</malay> like I should really <malay>bawa</malay> my own plastic bag or like bag in general
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
