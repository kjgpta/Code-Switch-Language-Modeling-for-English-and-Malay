I just wanna like because I don't have make up
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
[eh] <malay>aku nanti</malay> photoshop
is it okay !duh!
(oh) okay maybe nearer ya
ya okay maybe I should show my <malay>baju</malay> a little bit
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay

okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
<malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
okay later I will edit I will try to edit with lightroom so <malay>nampak macam</malay>
I because I I used I edit like preset on my lightroom <malay>punya</malay> account
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
is is more like <malay>untuk</malay> photographer [sia]
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
like your preset the <malay>macam</malay>
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take [what]
like if I end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take home [lah]
so like can I have to go back to orchard
[oh] [oh] the stop the bus
<malay>tak de</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> somerset somerset also will be easier [ah] because like somerset have take
then I stop at #dhoby ghaut#
[ah]
<malay>duduk sana</malay> [ah] <malay>depan</malay> laboratory <malay>kita</malay> why we sitting here
(uh huh)
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
<malay>aku semalam tak pergi sekolah</malay> [kan] I literally stay at home and watch #anime# ya
I watch #anime# then I watch this new K drama <malay>yang</malay> do you like #brams#
#brams# no
no no it's a it's a K drama about like classic music classical music (mm)
it's not bad [lah] I think next week [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
no actually K dramas [ah] korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
(hmm)
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart #ryeo# I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart #ryeo# was more than twenty episode I think
I think like twenty five or something I think so [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> I I wanted a season two
[oh] my god it was so good [kan] then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then !ee!
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
and technically the <malay>anak</malay> is a princess
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood [lah] because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
<malay>dia punya</malay> sister the cousin-in-law is a princess then got married to another prince then after that she became like this the lady in charge of all the princess and the kings <malay>punya mandi mandi</malay> and stuff
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something [ah] can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
I don't know but then chinese version <malay>ada</malay> season two
that is the thing
[kan] [oh] ya I saw
<malay>ya ke</malay>
(hmm) but then I feel like <malay>yang cina punya</malay>
drama the goals are [eh] like [meh]
like [eh] but then the case like korean dramas <malay>punya</malay> standard ya
[oh] you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know [ah]
I think china version of meteor garden that are four
one of the guy is the lead actor of this drama I finish watching
<malay>habis macam</malay> handsome <malay>gila</malay> [sia] he's like my favourite actor [ah]
dylan I think his name is dylan dylan #chen#

ya like that [ah] because like they are old people I guess
but at least like the the food is nice ya it's cheap also I want to eat the fried mushroom
super nice
<malay>sedap</malay> [sia]
maybe but then it's small
i'm' not I'm not sure
but then right I heard like if you book the down town east the new down town east resort
staycation #thingy# ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for !wah! !wah! wet
ya and I want to go !wah! !wah! wet
ya but if you book you get free [sia]
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap [ah] actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
because <malay>tempat dia pun kecil</malay> even at the two storey two storey room is small ya like when yo go inside the room right
you didn't have like toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds
ya so it's nothing much ya ya ya it's like it's like studio M but maybe slightly smaller I think because of the area and then more hipster
I wanna go cherry
so fun
[oh] my god I was so shook [sia]
and I felt so
guilty you know like I literally said sorry [eh] sorry [eh] I'm so sorry I'm so sorry about my friend they didn't even realise that then the malay malay bouncer said it's okay it's okay [dah] <malay>biasa selalu selalu macam gini</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] ya [sia]

(mm) so she have to
so she had to like flip her
her shirt
(um) (mm)
she had to flip her shirt <malay>macam</malay> from the front to the back so that the back [one] was in front then the back the back stained [ah] stained yet
ya [sia] but okay [lah] she was drunk so
(mm)
(um) sure
three [oh] my god so so <malay>lambat</malay>
I don't think so
I don't think so because
because confirm she will ask me like why didn't you take an earlier shift and the she be like then how to go back like very logical
ya ya she be like !huh! why you
why you just cannot earlier shift
why you can't <malay>balik siang</malay>

[kan] asian moms okay [lah] it's not a bad thing [lah] but sometimes it is
ya
but one point eight K is too much [ah] honestly
(um) not bad what you have to consider you have to consider your <malay>gaji</malay> you have to consider how much you have to set aside for like is being cut for example your food your home utilities
but that's not possible for a graduate student like just finish schools kind of
ya [sia] I mean like the most we can get is two point two I mean like that's the standard diploma
salary I think
true but you have to work [lah]
why not you rent your at your brother's house
he has a room what and the child is small
she doesn't need her own room yet
I mean like you cannot live there for technically like for free free <malay>apa</malay> you have to help out also right
ya but you are still living in the same quarters
so you have to actually do a little bit of chores
why would you even do that
I can't wait for my sister to have her own house
I mean I think she has or maybe like she contacting somebody I don't know [oh] my god it's so annoying <malay>tengok besar</malay> [sia] this is my stomach

I rebond my hair when my hair was pink and it wash of the pink colour and it became brown

but but it's true [ah] when you eat the TruFitz
