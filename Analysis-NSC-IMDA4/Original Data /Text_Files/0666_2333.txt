(mm) we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>keluar dengan kawan semua</malay> especially karaok
I mean like for this current situation right now you can still go out with friends [ah] but to like limited places and with limited amount of people I think the max is like five people or somethin
(mm) like I say limited places <malay>sebab</malay> like some places <malay>pukul sepuluh dah tutup</malay> [seh] so <malay>macam</malay
like there's lesser option for you to lik
(mm) choose from I gues
(mm
ya that sounds like a good plan <malay>tapi</malay> like as I said (mm) <malay>semua orang pun</malay> busy <malay>aku pun busy juga</malay> since I'm looking full tim
bu
if you really want to go staycation (err) you need to tell me earlier so I can like plan my schedule and take leave
(um) ahead <malay>kau nak pergi</malay> staycation (err
<malay>kau ada ke</malay> hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
(mm) actually that place one <malay>pun bagus juga</malay> [ah] I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
(mm
all I can say was that I remember the bed being comfy and I mean even there if there's like no pool right we can just chill and watch netflix and you know have food take away then we can eat at the hote
<malay>kalau ada</malay> room service <malay>pun baik juga</malay
(mm) talking about #shangri la# I came across the article <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> the smart local if I'm not wrong <malay>pasal</malay> the #shangri la
they actually having promotion where like I think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh
and you are paid seventy five dollars per adult and the good thing about that promotion is that you can have access to all the facilities [ah] mean you can go like if you like water activities we can go do some kind of lik
don't know the pedal thingy I don't know what you call that or we can just hang out by the poo
I don't know [lah] it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's end of this septembe
<malay>tak salah aku</malay> [ah
kno
(mm) (err) I mean like if really cannot find a like we really cannot go to shangri la there's other affordable hotels I guess if I'm not wrong you can use th
website agoda or something where you can find like a day hotel for you to hang out with my friend usually use that [lah] for like to surprise them for like birthday or something they always do that and (mm
what else [eh
<malay>aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat</malay> #shangri la# how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
waitress waiter if I'm not wron
he said the food there nice [lah] but <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah
(mm) ya maybe we should [ah] but we really have to plan well I guess I mean <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> staycation <malay>pun</malay> I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it [lah] maybe I ca
take you out for dinner or something you can jus
you know walk around singapore see the sight view or something but nowadays rain [lah] so I scared [sia
how to say go out later rain no umbrella stuck in rain borin
ya I remember <malay>pemalas malas nak jalan</malay> [oh] I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
(mm) if I'm not wrong my date went there before and he said that is not bad [lah] maybe [lah] we should we should go there but you have to find a time when it's not crowded and a lot of people (mm) if you really want to go cafe and like you know do some kind of activities righ
<malay>aku</malay> recommend <malay>kau pergi</malay> I mean we we can go to cat cafe <malay>dekat</malay> rail mal
very cute <malay>kau boleh main dengan kucing</malay> while you like have your dessert or some stuff (mm) cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad [lah] it's affordable and other than tha
I also heard about this cafe called the mind cafe but this one also like a lot of people has been going there and it's crowded so you really have to find a time where there's not a lot of peopl
the mind cafe is just like <malay>macam apa ni</malay> you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady <malay>asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu</malay>
oka
of cours
(uh huh
(uh) (uh) (mm) maybe can <malay>ajak ayu</malay> also [ah] bu
you know me I'm still awkward with her right cause like I never meet her for so long I also don't know what is she doing with life also like the last time I met her was whe
I accompanied her to her job to sign up for a job at this hotel I am not really sure but it's near suntec city or something like that then that was the last time I really like go out with her other than that I didn't talk to her I didn't text her or whatsoever it jus
<malay>pelik</malay> it's weird [ah] I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
(err
I mean ya [lah] <malay>aku tahu</malay> during secondary school I was a nerd [lah] cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school [lah] <malay>lelaki semua pecah</malay> [sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not <malay>pecah</malay> but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
(mm) but in pol
(mm) I don't really ya [lah] I I never reall
post if I have any like relationship or whatsoever because I feel like there's no poin
like you know posting online that I'm with this person or whatsoever as long as like me and him know that we're dating and he knows them well to tell other people that he's dating to
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online [lah] for me [ah] cause <malay>aku rasa kalau</malay> if show everything online <malay>nanti kalau kau orang</malay> break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing much I like to keep it low key to me [lah] the lesser people know the bette
like I will obviously I will tell my close friends [lah] that I I'm in a relationship and stuf
but y
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like <malay>kau orang</malay> just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me [ah

righ
okay [lah
he's weird just just stay away from him he give me he gives me weird vibe
but I really hope that you will quit delifrance cause that place is very toxic and the management is literal shit I don't know what other nicer words to describe their management to their towards their employer [eh] towards their employe
cause it's really really bad and I also heard about your manager your manager i
is not a very nice person [lah] as I can se
and I guess those I really think that delifrance or any kind of retail workers are underpaid [ah] I guess like having like seven fifty per hour or eight fifty per hour is not that sufficient especially you're working like part time part time only lik
a few days you can come to work [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay> fair [seh] <malay>kau tak akan</malay> earn <malay>tak akan apa ni</malay> hold <malay>duit yang cukup untuk sekolah</malay> and for your own like needs <malay>sebab aku tengok kau</malay> design <malay>kau selalu macam</malay
<malay>kena pakai</malay> printers <malay>semua untuk</malay> print <malay>kau punya</malay> project so <malay>tu semua pakai duit</malay> [sia
so ya please quit that jo
I mean the job is fine is just the culture there is ba
and I really hope this (um) new job will open more opportunity for you since it's like more in line to what you're doing for school right so you can build up your portfolio from ther
plus you have experience from your like internship so that will be a good point [ah

[a'ah] [sia] I don't know why they don't want to increase the minimum wage I feel like it's not fair [ah] your like some people in certain category are earning this much and this much for like you know for their work I don't think it's sufficient for them to liv
on with that kind of salary plus (um) <malay>aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja</malay> temperature taking righ
<malay>dia punya</malay> his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift
