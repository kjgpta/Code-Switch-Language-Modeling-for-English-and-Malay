then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it

so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
(hmm)
(hmm)
you know #hanis# never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me [eh]
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want [lah]
too lazy to talk to her
!hais!
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how #rina# always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from #sonya# that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know #hanisah#
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one [lah] down there right and then after that #rina# (uh) (uh) recently only (um) enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then <malay>nak kena</malay> go and study
they have leadership this leadership program [lah] basically but like
(um) #sofia# and #rina# said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked #hanisah# how long are you bonded with the school [lah] and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her [ah] because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her [lah] the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing [lah] but you think #hanisah# is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not [lah] but it's not worth it I think it's very <malay>bodoh</malay>
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only [ah] ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand [ah] like twenty two thousand I can understand [lah] but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already [lah] anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true [what] like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her [lah] I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with #sufian# and #rina# [what] like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare [lah] she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense [what]
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand [eh]
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know [lah]
I don't know at first she didn't tell me [lah] today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know [lah] is it
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then <malay>tak payh tak payah nak</malay> leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no [what]
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say [ah] who knows #rina# she say this you know who knows #rina# have something planned for me like dude
even if #rina# has something planned for you #rina# is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different [eh] in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss #saba#
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know <malay>itu pun</malay> so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread <malay>macam roti</malay>
[a'ah] during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also <malay>nakal</malay> [ah] but the girl quite angel [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> devil [lah] [kan] but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible [lah]
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents [ah] but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the [lah] what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see [lah] and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like [lah] and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know [ah]
and okay okay ya
okay sorry
