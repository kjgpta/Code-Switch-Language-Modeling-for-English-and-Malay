[oh] okay so what like <malay>sekarang</malay> like what line you you at like (uh) what industry
[oh] (um) early childhood

<malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>baru</malay> [jer] because
ya I <malay>baru</malay> graduate (uh) last year as in actually this year [lah] the <malay>apa tu</malay> during the period actually suppose to have our (um) ceremony [kan] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> ya so I'm the unlucky batch
(uh) singapore poly (um) I (uh) [oh] [oh] sorry you don't know ya
ya (um) ya so (um) I I got into an internship <malay>dia ajar bukan ajar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's speech and drama so I (um) my course actually applied drama and psychology (uh) so <malay>macam</malay> my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they <malay>macam</malay> post me to (uh) this early childhood not early childhood [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like somewhat <malay>macam budak-budak dia macam</malay> actually interested (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I got confuse I think I more interested in the (uh) in the drama side instead of teaching <malay>budak-budak</malay>
ya
when I was in internship [oh] (uh) so <malay>pagi kita</malay> okay (uh) so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so <malay>pagi</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's just admin job then the admin job <malay>pun macam</malay> like <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] I mean like it was difficult because halfway <malay>kita punya</malay> supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in (uh) the company because of some things happen (uh) then (uh) so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then <malay>baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang</malay> for class [kan] then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just (uh) <malay>tolong</malay> the teacher to just hype the class <malay>nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap</malay> something funny then we're just like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stupid <malay>gitu tapi macam</malay>
ya it's like to encourage them to <malay>macam</malay> speak up <malay>macam</malay> do do the drama with them <malay>macam</malay> we will have like (um) dramas (uh) drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
okay okay
ya so like now I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I <malay>nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak</malay> or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
(um) actually it's not like allow allow not like <malay>dia orang suka-suka nak</malay> allow but it's like (um) it's a bit unethical for me to work there also [lah] because like (err) I've been having <malay>macam</malay> low moods and stuff so <malay>macam kesian the budak-budak</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so <malay>macam</malay> I I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if it's because of my (um) my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm (um) but I I came clean to my boss like I <malay>bilang dia</malay> (uh) whatever that's been happening in my life then she say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I don't think you're you're capable of working now so <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> set my head straight [lah] (uh) maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel <malay>macam</malay> hundred percent here [lah] because like right now you're a like everywhere
ya
to to work he he he said you can go back right
ya existed that this he welcomes welcomed back then that's good
(mm) but like (um) ya
(mm)
[oh]
ya
ya
and that's a big decision to make [seh] because like (um) it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then <malay>macam</malay> in the future like <malay>kalau lambat</malay> then you it's hard for you to change but now <malay>macam</malay> is the time (um) for us to <malay>macam</malay> explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>susah</malay>
ya unless <malay>kalau kita kerja</malay> part time <malay>yang macam</malay> (um) temperature taking <malay>gitu semua</malay> I mean it's it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good ya it's better than nothing <malay>tapi macam</malay> the thing is [ah] I'm just worried <malay>macam</malay> this is just <malay>macam</malay> just graduate [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I think too much about stuff then (um) if I take that kind of job now then <malay>macam</malay> I don't have like much experience in like (uh) what I want to do in the future <malay>dia macam</malay> I scared <malay>macam</malay> I'm not prepared [lah] but this is just me overthinking [lah] but (um) if <malay>dapat dapat kerja</malay> the temperature taking <malay>pun macam bersyukur</malay> [seh] as of now
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>berapa lama</malay> the the webinar
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] but like !huh!
ya
(hmm)
that sounds great then I think (err) my sister also took that job [ah] last month but like so like webinar you don't have to go to any venue [kan]
(hmm)
!wow! that's really good because like actually (um) when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to <malay>macam</malay> a diploma conversion ya so but then (um) for now obviously cannot (uh) go to the school [lah] the <malay>tapi nanti</malay> if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I I don't know I feel like <malay>macam</malay> its a bit more demanding in a way <malay>macam</malay> and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit <malay>macam</malay> focused on like just real school
[oh] no (uh) it's not (uh) teaching the kids at home but (err) <malay>apa itu</malay> it's just like normal school <malay>macam</malay> we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning <malay>baru kita</malay> teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two (um) one we teach the kids at school real kids then <malay>balik</malay> then (err) the teacher that lecturer will teach us <malay>pula</malay> on like about kid
(um) honestly I feel like a bit <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class <malay>tapi</malay> (um) from what I think [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it depends on the company you work with <malay>kalau</malay> the company <malay>macam</malay> give you a lot of (uh) things to do like homework <malay>macam</malay> preparing worksheets for the kids <malay>tu semua</malay> they don't have like a proper system like <malay>tak ada macam mana</malay> [eh] they <malay>tak ada</malay> their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so <malay>macam</malay> it's that already a a lot of workload then <malay>kita pergi sekolah</malay> we have also we also have our assignment and like test <malay>tu semua</malay> ya so it's like it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> scary [kan]
[ah]
ya I feel I felt that way [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> that's why I felt really <malay>macam</malay> (um) I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown <malay>semua</malay>
(um) I think they because there's only one that just (uh) finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said <malay>macam</malay> is going to be difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) the <malay>tempat kerja</malay> even weekend sometimes the boss I think <malay>macam</malay> she didn't like intentionally do this <malay>tapi macam</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay> she will like text us during the weekends <malay>macam</malay> to tell us need to do this this this so <malay>macam</malay> (um) my colleague <malay>yang</malay> just finish the diploma <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then <malay>macam</malay> we we also have the our stuff to do so <malay>macam</malay> she she felt like it's a bit difficult [lah] to go through
that so <malay>macam</malay> she she was concerned about me [lah] because like she she knew that (uh) it's going to be tough for me and especially now [kan] (um) that's not enough teacher the card the company so so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of <malay>macam</malay> pressure on on the new teachers <malay>macam kita</malay> not teachers [lah] <malay>macam</malay> supposedly I'm not supposed to teach [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> they try their best not to <malay>macam</malay> expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes <malay>nak tak nak macam takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak biarkan</malay> the company to drown [kan] like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> she say it will be early will be more tough on me [lah] because everything is new then <malay>nak kena belajar nak kena</malay> adapt to the changes then like (uh) <malay>nak kena apa belajar lagi</malay>
(hmm) ya ya
so now you doing (um) a part time and working it's continue working at your industry or like on break too
(hmm)
[oh]
(hmm)
true
ya true
(hmm) (hmm)
[oh] so how is it so far
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) ya
#amin# sure #inshaallah#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya that's why (hmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's good
[ah] [ah]
[oh]
stress free
[oh] man ya that feels like me
!wah!
but then like okay so why why <malay>macam</malay> I'm stressing myself [kan] like I agree with you <malay>macam</malay> since since secondary school I already told myself <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then (um) but then now [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>takut</malay> because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this <malay>nak buat</malay> theatre <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] like there's no audience but I know there's some like <malay>macam</malay> virtual and stuff but then <malay>macam</malay> virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously (err) you it's easier for you to (um)
(uh) to stay there [lah] <malay>macam</malay> to continue from where you are <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> you are not in the theatre company then <malay>macam susah nak dapat nak ada</malay> audition <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
ya
early childhood (um) the thing is like for early childhood [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak ada</malay> (um) much experience other than my internship internship ya so (err) I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like (um) there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is (err) is (err) the company itself <malay>yang</malay> I am in right now is actually <malay>macam</malay> they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that (um) she <malay>tak ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> expect us to stay very long she just (uh) provide a platform for a like a stepping stone <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> she she encourages people to ya she <malay>macam</malay> looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing <malay>macam</malay> I know deep down that I am interested in theatre [lah] to I want to <malay>macam</malay> act again and stuff <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know in singapore <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so much that's the pressure [lah] ya I want to do theatre <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
(uh) for like <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay> early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then <malay>macam</malay> and early childhood is not bad the the pay [kan] especially in singapore because they need people but then like (um) and like if I don't continue for early childhood I <malay>macam</malay> I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit [lah] honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like <malay>macam</malay> average [lah] <malay>tapi jap</malay> [eh] my mum my mum is like texting me
ya ya okay later I come back to that
I'm twenty
ya
[oh] okay
that's good
(mm) ya
that's that's sweet because like my mom <malay>dia macam</malay> passive aggressive <malay>tak tahu nak cakap macam mana</malay> it's like ya she <malay>macam</malay> I (um) because <malay>dari kecil</malay> we don't really <malay>macam</malay> (um) not very affectionate we are <malay>macam</malay> okay ya so <malay>macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia</malay> a bit awkward <malay>macam nak</malay> open up <malay>pun</malay> a bit awkward
then <malay>macam</malay> every time <malay>macam dari kecil</malay> I <malay>nangis</malay> about like [oh] my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so <malay>macam</malay> like she taught me to be tough [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like (err) emotions she put away emotions <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>macam sekarang</malay> I <malay>sedih</malay> I <malay>marah</malay> or like anything [lah] then I cannot like go to her to talk about things [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I try my best <malay>walaupun dia macam</malay> push or try to avoid the emotion [kan] I will just like
try my best to explain to her [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I'm feeling this way because this this this <malay>tapi</malay> then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I <malay>cakap</malay> face to face she will <malay>macam</malay> like (um) suddenly become very cold then <malay>macam</malay> don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things <malay>macam</malay> (err) (err) if you cannot do it then I cannot force you <malay>macam</malay> that kind of stuff you know so <malay>macam</malay> I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not <malay>macam</malay> put any pressure on me but <malay>macam</malay> that itself already made me (err) pressurize ya
(mm)
ya
so so it's like (um) so if I (uh) like I what I wanted to say just now was (um) because if I don't want to continue with this early childhood right my other choice is only the theatre come a theatre industry but then like I know theatre industry won't make much money [lah] as compared to early childhood
!huh! (err) (err) I I have seniors but then <malay>macam</malay> I don't really talk to them <malay>macam</malay> I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there <malay>macam</malay> I don't want to stop ya
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I go for the safest (uh) option first which is the early childhood [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then <malay>macam</malay>
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off [lah] I would I would say so <malay>macam</malay> if like I don't have any this is just me [lah] (err) if I don't have any <malay>macam</malay> (um) any education or like any specific job in mind I scared <malay>macam</malay> like not good enough you know this is [kan]
(mm)
[ah]
(hmm) (hmm)
ya so (um) ya [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) as of now he keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> don't worry don't worry <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like (um) that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
like like (err) have you have you talk to your your boyfriend if you don't mind sharing
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
so he's okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
[oh] that's good
(mm) (mm) ya so like <malay>sekarang</malay> I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing [lah] because (um) it was a hard decision for me to make to like (uh) stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company (um) not preparing any anything for them <malay>macam macam</malay> very abruptly [lah] the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the one that just went through the conversion she <malay>macam</malay> very quite helpful [lah] she <malay>macam</malay> keep on saying [oh] it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat (err) ya we teaching the we we you <malay>macam</malay> assisting the same class
(mm)
(hmm) (hmm) but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting (um) the the same level [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I was (err) more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan]
then like (um) the the thing is they they have this thing in the company <malay>macam kalau</malay> craft teacher <malay>dengan</malay> language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that (err) idea so <malay>macam</malay> most of the time I was doing the craft then <malay>macam balik pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft weekends <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft so <malay>macam</malay> like it was really a lot of stress for me [lah] ya then (err) <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I that point of time <malay>geram dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia</malay> keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I'll do it I'll do it <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>tak buat</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> pressured [lah] because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the one
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it was really really irritating then <malay>sampai</malay> like (um) the colleagues (uh) [ah] my other colleagues we very small company [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they they saw me struggling <malay>gitu macam</malay> everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then (err) I my contract <malay>pula</malay> my timing ends at one thirty [ah] but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty <malay>gitu tapi</malay> my my timing [kan] I'm always there until four until three so <malay>macam</malay>
no no that's that's the thing so the company <malay>macam</malay> we already say in the contract so <malay>macam</malay> it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so <malay>macam</malay> ya that sucks [lah] that's <malay>macam</malay> that's why I feel like <malay>macam kalau</malay> I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm <malay>rabak</malay>
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so (um) if you have a diploma already but then you want to to <malay>macam</malay> decided to go for early childhood industry [kan] so you can apply at an at and then (err) and will consider [ah] <malay>macam</malay> but most of the time they will they will accept you [ah] because <malay>macam tak banyak</malay> in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is [lah] because like (um) it this is there's a stereotype of like (err) early childhood teachers gets a lot of because (um) there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that <malay>tak banyak</malay> in singapore <malay>nak buat</malay>
ya I don't know what to say about that so (err) so the the the diploma conversion (um) after we apply but then (err) we we find a company first [lah] we find the company we can get sponsorship if we work with the company less than six months
then (um) if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say [lah] the company wants to sponsor you then (um) they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so <malay>macam</malay> diploma <malay>tu semua macam</malay> (uh) your O level english <malay>tu semua</malay> and then (err) they will contact you [lah] [eh] but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and (um) october
ya
(uh) I right now I don't know if I want to continue [lah] because like after talking to you then <malay>macam</malay> like really make me realize <malay>macam</malay> ya I should just <malay>macam</malay> do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
(hmm)
(hmm)
(um) that's that's good but then like (um) that's I used to have savings (um) before before joining the company [kan] and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop <malay>rosak</malay> so I decided to buy a new laptop [lah] so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then <malay>macam</malay> the laptop won't be so much [lah] and I also look for a cheap laptop not like <malay>macam</malay> one thousand plus <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then (um) after I got the laptop so <malay>macam</malay> my savings to <malay>terjejas</malay> like affected already then then like (err) when I join the company then I got the pay already right then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] my first pay so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>belanja</malay> my my family to eat <malay>tu semua</malay> then like my boyfriend leaving so <malay>macam</malay> I help him with (um) (err) not help him <malay>macam</malay> like I give him as a gift to <malay>semua macam barang-barang</malay> for but not everything [lah] within just a few then <malay>macam</malay> I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like (um) broke <malay>macam</malay> mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like (um) I I didn't expect things to happen then <malay>macam</malay> my savings <malay>pun</malay> now like <malay>terjejas</malay> my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then <malay>macam</malay> I really feel <malay>macam</malay> everything is just
it's just <malay>cubaan</malay> now [lah]
(uh) haven't yet because like I it's just everything just started I just really like (err) I just quit my job last week
ya but it's very pressurizing [lah] because like
(hmm)
ya but like I like mention [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my (err) my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
(uh) no I actually still have contract before until next year december ya

ya
ya
ya [lah]
ya
[ah] [ah]
ya that's true
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I <malay>masih macam</malay> like in the past as they have this <malay>macam</malay> (um) want to like put (uh) put some into my savings so like now <malay>macam</malay> even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so <malay>macam</malay> [oh] but [oh] my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just <malay>macam nak lepaskan</malay> anger <malay>gitu</malay> because like I'm so annoyed because (err) so this month <malay>punya</malay> pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so <malay>macam</malay> every time this month it's just very unlucky for me [lah] I got food poisoning [lah] I got like <malay>macam selesema</malay> [lah] because there has been like cold (uh) cold bug around the school so (err) then I got it also then I also <malay>macam ada</malay> panic attack in one of the night because I <malay>ingat</malay> I injured my neck so <malay>macam</malay> this month I took a lot of thinking that <malay>macam</malay> you can like I can claim from their [lah] then <malay>rupanya</malay> they cut cut it off from my from my <malay>gaji</malay> then because like (err) I still <malay>macam baru kerja situ</malay> it's still not three months yet something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard <malay>macam</malay> from my I'm not I don't know [lah] I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so <malay>macam</malay> and that's why I thought <malay>macam</malay> (um) we I already <malay>macam</malay> can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day <malay>baru</malay> like I she mentioned [ah] about <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so <malay>macam</malay> (uh)
the contract says I have (uh) I have seven days and like they never say any probation
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu</malay> [kan]
ya that's true
no they didn't
(err) ya [lah] doesn't <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I just feel a lot of guilt (err) towards the company so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to bring it up or not [ah] because (err) then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then <malay>macam</malay> they cutting from my <malay>gaji</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I already had in mind okay my <malay>gaji</malay> month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they <malay>rupanya</malay> they will like <malay>macam</malay> will not get a refund if I <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>gaji dah kurang</malay> then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay [kan] obviously the company won't ask won't <malay>macam</malay> want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then <malay>macam</malay> !aduh! <malay>sedih gila</malay> [seh]
ya
so it's like
like like I said [lah] that's why <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life (um) because like money wise then <malay>macam</malay> like (um) my boyfriend left for <malay>rasa macam</malay> got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really [lah] what's the everything is just falling apart
I have <malay>kakak</malay> but then like she she move out already because she <malay>nikah</malay>
(hmm) two actually but (um) my I'm not close to my eldest one because (uh) she we <malay>lain mak</malay>
<malay>sama bapak lain mak</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya
so
(um)
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like (um) that won't bring that I won't bring it back home <malay>macam buat kerja kat situ</malay> then <malay>balik tak buat apa-apa</malay>
<malay>macam kalau penat penat kat kerja</malay> [jer]
I mean other than like there's (um) part time like <malay>macam</malay> F&B <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] guess can can do that <malay>tapi macam</malay> I don't know I kind of I'm not (um) I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I can (uh) I can stay in can do that kind of part time but <malay>macam</malay> if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm)
ya
ya maybe I could think of that too
(um) that's true [oh] my god I need to keep you on reminding myself that
(err) actually I just when yesterday (um) ya but then like (um) I I did not go poly though I I went to check organization do you know
organization so they are actually under <malay>macam</malay> they are more they work more with community instead of (err) [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> like you are the patient [kan] ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you just <malay>macam</malay> go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then (um) <malay>macam</malay> they will tell you [lah] or you you might need <malay>macam</malay> counselling or what then <malay>macam</malay> they will refer you to them [lah] me (err) I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy [ah] I'm not so sure about that but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) because yesterday when they told me about the the (err) what I can do next then <malay>macam</malay> rate of like (err) what the next thing then we just counselling [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
(err) I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] don't really [ah] take you no cannot ya
[oh] okay sure okay
