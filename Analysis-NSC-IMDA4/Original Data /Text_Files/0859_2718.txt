women who who who
[oh] my god and then then <malay>sekarang sekolah macam mana masih kat (uh) <malay>masih kat rumah juga</malay>
[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> call call <malay>cikgu cikgu ini semua</malay> like
<malay>leceh</malay>
more like like usually you know when you go to the class then you like <malay>kenal</malay> all the <malay>muka muka</malay> of all the <malay>cikgu</malay>
then you can
<malay>macam berbual berbual sikit</malay>
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like [what] or they use Zoom [ah]
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
ya it's like it's like you <malay>berbual</malay> with like some
<malay>orang yang tak kenal</malay> [kan] then <malay>susah nak berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
I <malay>tak kenal</malay> anyone
like not even the profile picture [dah] <malay>ada dia orang belum letak lagi</malay> you know
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say [eh] teacher how to do this [one]
you know
[oh] god but then now that at home right

nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
[oh] my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much [ah] six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three

I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times

<malay>untuk</malay> for like
<malay>berapa</malay> like <malay>sembilan puluh</malay> dollar <malay>lebih</malay>
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad [lah] but then
[dah] [dah] <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
damn you should play it
[oh] my god you just now just saw you say miss #bae# right like miss #bae# from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school [sia] I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
[dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual dengan cikgu cikgu melayu</malay> all
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
ya [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual</malay> then like <malay>macam</malay> you see other than <malay>cikgu dia baik juga</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan kita orang</malay>
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the [one] I was I was the [one] I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first [one]
okay [ah] I might be the worst [ah] but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no [lah] he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister #irman#
that teacher
then after that like (uh) I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his (uh) attitude [ah] he's like he would prefer to like (uh) (uh) give his attention to those who are better you know
he want to keep the A students A then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he
<malay>selepas itu diam diam</malay> I was like ignore [ah]
<malay>dia macam tak suka layan</malay> my my artworks then he <malay>tak nak</malay> really <malay>tolong</malay>
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
<malay>tak apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>selepas itu</malay> then like mister #shafrin# came
the person that came <malay>mabuk</malay>
he like he like one <malay>malaikat</malay> like that
for O level art I think I I wanted to do like some [oh] remember me <malay>beli</malay> the right then after that like I take pictures of the <malay>dia keras</malay>
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
no because it showed like <malay>macam</malay> the perspective of how a small person just as a big person would be
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
I just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old
[oh]
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] I remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
then like I also like <malay>jumpa</malay> a lot of <malay>pak cik</malay>
the <malay>selalu kata</malay> to me [ah] like
(uh)
<malay>selepas sekolah selalu</malay> just <malay>pergi</malay>
trail
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like
it's (uh) <malay>satu jam</malay> cycle from <malay>rumah</malay> all the way back to
the trail then <malay>selepas itu</malay> from the trail <malay>pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon</malay>
<malay>selepas sekolah</malay> but then like
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
I <malay>tak rasa</malay> like can <malay>boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini</malay> [ah] because <malay>nanti terlalu penat</malay> [ah] <malay>selepas selepas sekolah</malay> [dah] <malay>penat</malay> then <malay>selepas itu nak pergi</malay> cycle <malay>selepas</malay> <malay>selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh</malay> [dah] <malay>lagi penat</malay>
then <malay>selepas itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga</malay>
<malay>semakin penat</malay> [seh]
like that <malay>salah buat</malay>
ya
just <malay>penat</malay>
tired
even in english also I can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
like still <malay>masih tak</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>ada rasa macam nak masuk jadi orang</malay> army [kan]
<malay>tapi selepas itu</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>takut kena dapat kerja merepek</malay> [ah]
it's
I don't know [ah] people here people always say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if sign on [oh] later you
you <malay>kena</malay> you will <malay>kena banyak banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>nanti tak tak</malay> enjoy you know
ya
but
but sadly <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like engineering
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui sui# in engineering
(mm) got chemical engineering
[oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> ya earn and learn <malay>itu sekarang banyak orang tengah</malay> apply
my mum also <malay>kata</malay> like <malay>macam nak ambil juga</malay> [ah] it's like <malay>boleh</malay> upgrade skills but at the same time <malay>boleh belajar</malay> [eh] no <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kerja</malay> and then and earn <malay>duit</malay>
you know
[ah]
[a'ah] <malay>gaji dia tak seberapa tapi</malay> it's
<malay>lebih bagus daripada tak ada apa apa terus</malay>
[ah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> nowadays also
<malay>banyak orang tengah hilang kerja</malay>
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
L <malay>banyak orang kena pecat</malay> so quite <malay>sedih</malay> though
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
ya it's like quite sad like I know singaporeans like <malay>gaji</malay>
<malay>banyak juga</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>tak seberapa</malay> [pe] like
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like if Tiba Tiba the [oh] <malay>gaji potong</malay> then like their lifestyle is still the same you know
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
ya <malay>rumah dia orang terlalu kecik</malay> [ah] then also <malay>tak boleh</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan]
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> even if <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau</malay> or like <malay>adik beradik kacau</malay>
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
they were like showing like <malay>macam</malay> a got these people they were doing like Zoom workouts
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
so like <malay>selepas itu</malay> he just <malay>buat kat tangga</malay> [ah] <malay>kat tangga lebih banyak ruang</malay> [pe]
ya
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> also got the malay dance group
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
so basically they just individually <malay>semua</malay> like <malay>joget kat depan</malay> camera
savage love ya I don't know but then like
but then like they just <malay>joget</malay> at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
you just open up the game that [one] [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay> Minecraft that [one] then you farm farm <malay>kat dalam</malay> game
<malay>sama juga</malay> [pe] like you
<malay>berkebun</malay>
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable [sia] but I like the concept
ya <malay>tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu</malay> like
to me to to me like <malay>sayur semua rasa sama</malay>
it's like
<malay>but rasanya macam bila gigit daun</malay> then <malay>keluar air</malay>
<malay>rasa dia semua sama tak pernah tukar</malay> even <malay>kalau ada sambal</malay> [kan] <malay>sambalnya</malay> just <malay>tutup dia punya air</malay> like when I <malay>gigit</malay> into the <malay>sayur</malay> right <malay>masih rasa</malay> [eh] <malay>ini macam sayur macam daun keluar air</malay> then <malay>ada sambal itu</malay> [jer]
<malay>tak pernah rasa lain</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi sayur bagus untuk kesihatan</malay>
<malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur tapi suka</malay> earth so <malay>mesti</malay>
so must (uh) <malay>buat</malay> hydroponic <malay>gitu [lah]</malay>
yes
ya
and eating all the <malay>kambing</malay> the <malay>kambing semua makan rumput</malay> [kan]
<malay>rumput buat</malay> oxygen
<malay>saya makan kambing semua untuk</malay> save the earth
ya <malay>lebih rumput</malay> you know
(mm) but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
then <malay>macam</malay> very cool [lah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> [kan]
I <malay>menang</malay> something
because <malay>dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya</malay> competition [ah] <malay>untuk macam bagi budak budak</malay> chance <malay>bawa balik benda</malay>
then after that I <malay>menang</malay>
I <malay>menang</malay> like a small <malay>pokok</malay> Ribena
ya
I think same thing like grape [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like mash mash mash
then after that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> just <malay>kumpul</malay> together then <malay>buat macam</malay> syrup
[a'ah]
ya
ya I think the moment they like boil and then after that they make <malay>macam</malay> like concentrate
then <malay>selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air</malay> syrup <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk buat yang kita</malay> buy <malay>itu</malay>
more thick
like more <malay>pekat</malay> [ah] I think I think confirm got like got like sugar inside like sugar syrup
to make it more thick
but ya then after that I I won the <malay>pokok</malay>
no <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) they just ask about the facts on the <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] like the hydroponic or like how how like I forgot [what] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant [ah] I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually I saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
