pharmacy [ah]
<malay>kau pula kau punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
I say
if you really like it then
you can start by building up your portfolio now
by like trying all this part time under design media stuff
cause nowadays these days
[kan] (um) cause of the time
there isn't much jobs right but then they also calling a lot of design production so you can try to like build up your portfolio
so you can try to like build up your portfolio
because uni all about portfolio [what] so starting from now you can try you know
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah</malay>
and then <malay>kalau nak</malay> try under pharmacy <malay>pula dorang punya</malay>
working hours also a bit tough
then
then like (um)
you all need <malay>macam</malay> diploma degree <malay>baru boleh dapat</malay> the experience
so my course a bit tough [ah] I just need to wait until internship [lor]
<malay>aku tengah cari kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang tapi pasal</malay>
COVID [kan]
so
times are tough [ah] so I know for government <malay>pun</malay> they <malay>macam</malay>
they
they retrenched quite a number of people so
a bit tough to find job now even though <malay>macam</malay>
they need people
they also need very quality type of people you know [ah]
#ons# bro if it's like nothing to do with our diploma then okay [lor]
my exam [ah] (hmm)
my exam can [lah] can do can do by is cause
because COVID [mah] so
everything online and is not paper exam written is all like coursework and assignment then you got oral oral viva or something like that I don't know [ah] our brand new for because of COVID so like
a bit difficult [ah] or I I still don't understand the system a bit
to be honest right [ah]
I at home I sleep you know
so like I sleep you know so like cause it's where my comfort comfortable place is [mah] so it's like at home
then near my bed like that then
very very easily to just go on my bed and just sleep you know you [leh] you have right for the whole semester
I mean slowly if the situation getting better [ah]
some classes is online some classes offline not too bad [ah] but like
if really the whole of my
five days is online [ah] (hmm) bro I just sit at home not even listening I eat eat eat at home not even listening to class
teacher go through stuff also I like a bit don't understand but I also don't want be you know in front class unmute then suddenly everybody hear my question
so a bit [lah] I don't think so I can <malay>tahan</malay> [lor]
they don't also really need and not much people also tourist don't have
ask people also don't have want to up the economy [mah] so
if we apply job all then a bit tough [ah]
relate bro is like I swear I got no money then like I keep spending you know all the shopee sale and all
today nine nine (hmm) got no money bro
possible [meh]
bro got one time
the person [ah] the shopee person
keep going into my house keep knocking my house door like
[eh] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> COVID COVID <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku dengar</malay> that time <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>aku bilang kau aku ada concert satu kat sini</malay>
<malay>satu kat</malay> malaysia
and you know what because of COVID the [one] in singapore got close down first [oh]
cause the singapore issue was more more prominent you know
so like
then the other concert was in malaysia
I haven't book ticket for the flight so that's good
but is I already book ticket for the concert itself but got cancelled last minute and then after that cancelled and then immediately don't have the concert anymore so cause of COVID I also cannot watch the concert cause the concert thing is all like close packed right so
what to say [ah]
that [one] is what I miss what I missed the most cause of COVID I want go to concert and all
for both the concert
the [one] in singapore was
then the [one] in malaysia was super junior [ah] you know the sorry sorry guy
then [ah]
the [one] in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia <malay>tu</malay> a bit slow [ah]
cause they want show cancel or not [ah] then they cancel then they refund a bit slow but I got both the refund if I have bought the flight ticket right
malaysia airline won't refund [one]
(hmm)
I think
not much [lor] from singapore to malaysia maybe about one hundred (hmm)
(hmm)
I think right I think you will like got seven
can [lah] can relate my money gone so fast man no job now right cause now [ah] COVID then they do online concert
online concert take so much money also but then after that #sian# [lah] my money all gone [lor]
[oh] same [lah] same [lah] like they all like multinational people but then they all cause they train in train in korea right so all of them in korea [lor] like you know all of them chinese member [hor] you all cannot go back [ah] so they only stay in korea
I think right
I think I'll be homesick [lor] cause [ah] I a bit of a mother's girl so a bit of mummy's girl so like my mother not with me [ah] I think I will like I don't feel comfortable [lor] then I will also definitely enjoy the experience [ah] going overseas and then study you know
you [leh] you ever thought about studying overseas
I think australia will be the most safest for me and like but then the thing is realistically speaking you also don't know if the cert can be taken in singapore but theoretically I want to study in korea why cause can see my #oppa#
(um) that's why [ah] if like you want to study overseas as a <malay>melayu</malay> I think [kan] australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where [ah] the place has accommodates to what you are [lah] like being a muslim so <malay>kalau kau nak tinggal kat</malay> korea <malay>kau kena tinggal kat</malay> #itaewon# <malay>situ</malay> [ah] [ah] cause I heard situ <malay>banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi</malay> contradict <malay>juga situ juga banyak tempat</malay> clubbing
so right <malay>semenjak kita kat rumah</malay> [kan] confirm <malay>kau tengok banyak</malay> Netflix [kan] confirm so <malay>macam cerita apa kau tengok kat</malay> Netflix
<malay>tak aku tengok</malay> movie [eh]

(hmm)
or a bar right I saw recently did it just came up but
no <malay>bukan</malay> part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different (um) two different parts [ah] so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes [mah] so in september then they resuming back [lor] cause the COVID

[oh] cause my [one] I watch on Netflix so no advertisement
I leech off my cousin
[oh] talking about singapore [ah] cause they want to try to cause no tourist [what] so they want to try to increase the tourism board they got a lot of interesting attraction nowadays now fifty percent off at zoo [eh] or river safari or night safari I haven't been [lor] cause my family trying to get the tickets [ah] then there's also like discounted price for you know now is fifty eight dollar like including a LiHO drink then other than that (um) other that and the one land resort I think wildlife resort singapore maybe you can try everybody now going cycling at like #pulau ubin# or coney island have you been to coney island
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if <malay>kat situ macam ada tempat</malay> rental bike [kan] <malay>macam</malay> east coast park [kan] <malay>ada tapi</malay> I <malay>dengar</malay> east coast park <malay>pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ</malay>
