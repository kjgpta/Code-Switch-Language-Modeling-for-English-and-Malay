(mmhmm)
<malay>apa ni</malay>
what do you mean by not progressing
actually (um)
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something <malay>macam</malay> similar
because I kind of miss <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat benda</malay> like I miss being like creative I guess
so like <malay>aku rasa</malay> like (um)
I follow a lot of <malay>macam</malay> Instagram shops actually and like
because like <malay>aku sekarang kirakan aku</malay> I don't have [eh] no no no sorry I have free time now
so like I want to make use of it
even though (um) the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit [ah] cause like
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to <malay>dapat kerja</malay> but
yes <malay>dah</malay> so (um) I think
I think maybe I want to <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know [eh]
I mean I I always see I <malay>selalu cakap nak</malay>
<malay>buat baju buat</malay>
<malay>baju</malay> you know what I mean but then I I don't know [ah] I don't know where to start where do you start
(mm)
cause like honestly nowadays
I know that a lot of people have like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku aku</malay> maybe <malay>rasa macam</malay> low-key <malay>aku boleh</malay> I can tell that some people
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
pandemic <malay>punya tu</malay> then like
and I mean I understand also [lah] cause <malay>aku pun sama juga</malay>
like at first <malay>aku pun sama juga</malay> but then like
<malay>aku macam</malay> low-key <malay>macam</malay> not not jealous but <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know how to explain the feeling [ah] I think I think <malay>aku macam</malay>
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
<malay>semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama</malay> you know then like
obviously <malay>kita orang</malay> like feel like we can do better so
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
the thing is right <malay>yang yang kau cakap pasal</malay> the embroidery <malay>punya</malay> tote bag <malay>tu</malay> it's
I saw
honestly [kan] I <malay>nampak pernah nampak dekat</malay> TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I come across [eh] <malay>bukan apa</malay> (uh) the TikTok is like
(err)
<malay>macam</malay> shop <malay>punya</malay> [lah] then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign <malay>punya</malay>
country <malay>punya</malay> shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing <malay>dia buat</malay> tote bag then she <malay>pakai</malay> sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because <malay>dia punya</malay> machine <malay>ada dia punya</malay> function <malay>abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam</malay>
isn't that like <malay>macam</malay> no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to <malay>macam</malay> like sit there and actually like <malay>betulkan</malay> settings and all it <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> it's like simple to and it's not her herself <malay>tengah</malay> embroidered right is the machine doing it
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
that <malay>orang</malay> singapore <malay>buat</malay> so <malay>macam kalau</malay> is <malay>macam</malay> simple <malay>gitu</malay> then like
(um)
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is (err) embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do [lah] we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
one particular this (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> account like <malay>jual</malay>
[ah] necklaces or like earrings
<malay>apa tu</malay> spectacle chain or whatever
[oh] ya ya ya
ya ya [oh] my god ya
(mm)
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to (um)
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
maybe have <malay>baju</malay> custom fit for their own
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that [oh] this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
[eh] average [lah] ya and then like
<malay>kadang-kadang boleh pakai</malay> S <malay>kadang-kadang boleh pakai</malay> M depends [lah] (uh) most of the time S M <malay>gitu</malay>
then like you know how they have those (uh) sizes <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> Cotton On they have (um) S M or like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
(mm) (mm) so like I'm like
how is it that this (uh) <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tengah pakai ni</malay> like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
like what if like you on the
you M but you on the verge of L like <malay>kau boleh sumbat ke ni</malay>
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
<malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
I don't understand
[orh]
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call (uh) sustainable is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
(um) I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
to me and you I guess cause <malay>kita orang dua selalu baca</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita tahu</malay> like what's the difference
but like you know how (um)
<malay>ada</malay> a few <malay>kedai kedai macam</malay>
online <malay>macam</malay> Loop Garms
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and (um)
there's also another one <malay>dekat jalan pisang yang</malay> Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high <malay>sangat dia punya</malay> prices but ya like <malay>apa</malay>
cause that time (um) actually
my boyfriend actually ask (uh) ask me (uh) send me this post by Loop Garms
and is actually this [ah] you <malay>tahu</malay> (uh) #jericho#
[ah] chris chris #jericho# ya chris #jericho# the shirt
then [ah] he like he like it [ah] cause he really like [ah]
like he was really a fan of the nineties <malay>punya</malay> <malay>semua</malay> so
like he was saying like he likes it [ah] then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
<malay>pernah pergi</malay> area <malay>itu</malay> then like <malay>macam</malay> a few times drop by already together
then I think <malay>dia selalu berbual dengan</malay> one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then (um)
I was like <malay>kenapa kau tak nak tanya</malay> [jer] [jer] [lah] but then he <malay>macam malu</malay> so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>macam mana boleh</malay> hundred dollars <malay>ni macam</malay> expensive <malay>gila</malay>
but but I mean like I guess
maybe it's cause <malay>macam</malay> maybe it's imported from somewhere <malay>macam</malay>
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that <malay>tapi macam</malay> I don't know it's like
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that (um) as thrifting
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is <malay>macam</malay>
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage <malay>kau betul-betul</malay> pay the price for the vintage [ah] thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like <malay>lama gila</malay> and like
you can see that is <malay>macam</malay> been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
people see it as an investment
because it can also be an investment [what] <malay>kalau</malay>
that shirt <malay>yang</malay> chris #jericho# <malay>punya</malay> shirt <malay>tu</malay> technically it can be an investment cause like
I mean there's still a lot of fans it's just that maybe like
they maybe not don't really know of chris #jericho# [ah] cause <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>lama-lama sikit</malay> [kan]
[ah] ya <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>punya tu</malay> but like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to <malay>macam</malay>
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it <malay>macam baru balik</malay> it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it <malay>baru</malay>
so ya
[ah]
the whole [oh] okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more [lah] like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like (um)
<malay>kita orang</malay> just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain [pe] [seh] but I guess like it's been <malay>berapa</malay> the fashion industry <malay>dah lama</malay>
[ah] <malay>dibina</malay> so like
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like people <malay>dulu macam tak kesah</malay> but like at least now <malay>kita orang macam</malay>
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
(um)
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to (um) reduce (um)
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that (uh) I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> meant well but then
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
kind of (um) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> misused it
right misuse and also <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] just <malay>salah guna</malay>
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
I honestly I honestly think it's cause <malay>kita orang macam</malay>
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
just <malay>kita orang</malay> no longer live in that
ya era era ya so
(um) I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
so like once we use something we just <malay>nak buang</malay>
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
(uh) how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly (uh)
what we talking about
we we are actually talking about <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>kedai</malay> right
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like
I think maybe
for now you just try to
you just <malay>cuba</malay> [lah] <malay>jual</malay> to to your like whoever who's ordered you <malay>ada berapa banyak</malay> order <malay>sekarang</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi belum</malay>
[orh] <malay>yang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang</malay> backpack <malay>tu</malay> [eh] [orh] K
(um) I think that [one] once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price (uh) honestly
I I also don't I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
[oh]
okay but but I think (mm)
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders <malay>sekarang ni yang</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> [kan]
you once you <malay>dah dibayar</malay> (um)
honestly <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> [kan] promote is actually not that
pricey [lah] in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you can actually <malay>macam</malay>
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
[ah] cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
(uh)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever [lah] like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
[ah] by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
but then if you <malay>buat macam</malay> specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up <malay>macam kau bila kau tengok</malay> story <malay>orang</malay> [kan] it will pop up between stories <malay>gitu</malay>
overseas
ya
it's not really <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I think you got I think you <malay>pernah</malay> tag me under
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
[orh]
<malay>aku pun nak</malay>
should we order together
[lah]
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
like cause it's very <malay>macam</malay> it's not only unique but then like it's very <malay>macam ikut</malay>
demand <malay>gitu</malay> it's kind of cool
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if (uh) if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
I would I would probably suggest (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> start with a few design <malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>macam kau</malay> post <malay>dulu</malay> then whichever is popular
like <malay>kau</malay> just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then (um) <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> (um)
<malay>orang macam minta</malay> or whatever
like I guess you can just <malay>macam buat macam</malay> poll [lah] on your story whatever then you just ask like
will you be interested then you see [lah] how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
shop I guess cause like
(uh) <malay>kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya</malay> customer <malay>kau</malay> like <malay>apa dorang nak</malay> and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
<malay>kau tak ada</malay> inspiration you know what I mean like what if <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> you
<malay>macam</malay>
cannot come up with anything new
then obviously it will be <malay>susah</malay> [what] so I think it's important to have like
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know [ah]
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart [lah] and also and also
<malay>dia ada</malay> following so <malay>senang</malay> in my opinion no offence [lah] <malay>kalau kau ada</malay> the following [kan]
it's just easier for you to <malay>macam jual benda</malay> cause <malay>kau dah ada</malay> following <malay>banyak orang dia ada dua puluh</malay> K [tau]
<malay>dua puluh ribu</malay> sorry <malay>dua puluh</malay> K on her main account ya so like
you post about it like once on her story
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K <malay>gitu akan tengok apa</malay>
ya maybe like half <malay>gitu</malay> at most I mean at least maybe ten K
you know what I mean and that's still a lot [what]
anyway the designs also so cute [seh]
<malay>dia tak ada</malay> lining [eh] <malay>kat dalam</malay>
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love (uh) that some some
ya some shops do that <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but <malay>dorang</malay>
<malay>pernah macam</malay> promote a few smaller businesses
then <malay>macam</malay> that's so cute cause like <malay>macam</malay> you know like support local ya exactly support local <malay>gitu</malay>
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly (um)
(err)
I kind of <malay>macam</malay> considered cause you know how I like I love to wear <malay>macam</malay> outerwear again
actually I considering <malay>macam belajar macam mana nak buat</malay> cause I love
I love outerwear <malay>macam gini</malay> I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear <malay>gini</malay> like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know [ah] I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I stress out about the fact that I have free time <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>bila aku dah</malay> stress out <malay>pasal</malay> free time until <malay>nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh</malay> like I never use that free time wisely
I don't understand why like I already have free time [what] I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
actually (um) <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] (uh) I was considering (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>sambung belajar</malay> ya
I'm actually still thinking about it
because my parents are quite okay [lah] I'm very blessed because they quite supportive [lah] <malay>dorang macam</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> okay <malay>kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke</malay>
<malay>dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa</malay> but
but ya so like I actually kind of
still thinking about it and then one of the things <malay>aku</malay> realise
because (uh) <malay>aku dah</malay> I know <malay>aku baru kerja dua</malay> jobs but I I guess my parents <malay>pun</malay> realise <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku macam</malay> adaptable cause like
whenever <malay>aku kerja senang</malay> [jer] adapt to the situation cause it's just <malay>kerja</malay> [what] you know what I mean like it's not really
to me it's not really that complicated
but ya so (uh) <malay>apa aku macam</malay> realise
you know accounting actually I think
a part of me <malay>macam</malay>
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then (um)
I realised that <malay>kalau kau tahu</malay> accounting
<malay>senang sikit kau nak dapat kerja</malay>
because (um)
course <malay>kau tak pernah tu</malay> [eh]
okay (uh)
okay so I I took when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well [lah] honestly but
but I still understand what it is [lah]
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know how to explain <malay>kau tahu macam</malay>
financial statement or whatever okay no [ah]
like
<malay>tak</malay> it's not that (um)
<malay>kau pernah dengar</malay> the term <malay>macam</malay> assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically <malay>macam</malay>
how do I put this normally businesses <malay>ada</malay> accounting accountant
so basically (uh) accountant <malay>ni macam</malay> keep track of their balances
<malay>macam</malay> accounts [lah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> account bank account <malay>ke apa ke</malay> like
there will always be balance right then you can see like <malay>kau</malay> spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to <malay>tengok</malay> and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something <malay>macam</malay> off <malay>sikit dorang kena</malay> track <malay>kenapa</malay> off and like
why is it off like maybe <malay>dia macam</malay>
it's either <malay>terlebih</malay> or <malay>terlalu sikit</malay> then they must check where it is [lah]
<malay>aku pernah belajar</malay> [kan] I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
(um) <malay>bila aku fikir balik</malay>
is not
it's not difficult [lah] it's just that at that time <malay>aku tak</malay> interested <malay>nak belajar tu benda</malay> cause like it's
it's not dreadful but then
<malay>aku aku rasa cikgu aku</malay> just dreadful <malay>agaknya</malay> [ah]
but ya then like <malay>kalau</malay> accounting [kan] actually <malay>ada banyak</malay>
<malay>apa tu nama dia</malay>
<malay>ada banyak</malay> sector cause you can do auditing you can do [ah] bookkeeping
it's honestly just very is desk job [lah] but you
if you are an accountant [kan] <malay>kau macam</malay>
in a way <malay>kau boleh jadi</malay> your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it [lah] but <malay>kalau kau</malay>
<malay>ada macam</malay> some form of background in accounting <malay>senang sikit kau nak</malay>
<malay>dapat kerja</malay> in a way
ya
ya (mm)
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] pandemic [kan]
so like [ah] <malay>kalau kau fikir balik</malay> the main
(um) industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously [lah] cause
<malay>mana-mana pun</malay> food <malay>ada</malay> [kan] and (um)
maybe
<malay>lagi</malay>
[ah] yes education and then
[ah] ya delivery like
ya [lah] just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
these things are the <malay>macam</malay> industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
but arts will always be affected
ya
and what [ah] but like you know [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
is it wild rice or is it singapore repertory theatre
they have [ah] I think they holding a performance I don't know
really
I got the email for it (mm)
I was like do I why did I subscribe to
(mm)
hotel [orh] it's a production
is it popular or what
boring
boring [jer]
<malay>tak</malay> interested <malay>untuk tengok></malay> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment [lah] about that guy
like I can't make you a man or whatever what's that line [ah]
something you are not [ah] okay yes
[oh] <malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] plot <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>aku tak ingat</malay>
I think it is because like because
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion <malay>kita orang</malay> no longer ignorant
so because <malay>kita orang</malay> no longer ignorant I guess (um)
<malay>dorang</malay> just trying to fit into
yes
it instead of it being like a
<malay>betul</malay> like a proper cause that they doing like
[oh] I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like [oh] I'm just going to cast this
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just <malay>ikut</malay> just <malay>ikut</malay> stereotype you know what I mean
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely
certain race or whatever I don't know
[ah] ya ya ya ya
#jameela#
<malay>abeh ada yang</malay>
[ah] yes yes yes
<malay>nama dia</malay> jason like in the show jason <malay>dengan</malay>
#tahani#
yes
ya
ya
I know you trying to think of for a show where
honestly <malay>aku rasa aku rasa macam mana</malay> I I know I had a point but then like
<malay>pasal kita dah berbual aku macam</malay> lost my point [ah] (mm)
<malay>sekejap</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> okay <malay>pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu</malay> [kan]
<malay>yang</malay> firefighter and then the grey's anatomy <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] it's so it's [ah] it's just
I don't know [ah] like
low-key <malay>aku rasa</malay> is because <malay>dorang ada</malay>
fascination <malay>dengan budak</malay>
<malay>tudung buka tudung</malay>
<malay>aku rasa dorang ada</malay> I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it [ah] but I think <malay>aku</malay> low-key <malay>rasa</malay> porn has something to do with it because
yes because
