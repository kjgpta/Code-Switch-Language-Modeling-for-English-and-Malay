yeah soon she just gave her (err) resignation letter
so have to wait [lah] before they can you know like say okay you can go
(um) [oh] yeah I just got the email yesterday but actually nothing much [lah] they just say that
it just a conversation between
the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that [oh] near this <malay> ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list [lah] that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah
[ah] yeah there's like four five other people
no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone [ah] which is <malay> sedih yeah
no
no
my last intern also I was alone so like I'm like extra sad right now cause like I don't have anyone to eat lunch with yeah
yeah so far
yeah
so
then for you you don't have intern right but yours is a project so its confirm [ah]
[oh]
(hmm)
do you know who else will be in your team
(hmm)
yeah I agree I agree that's good that's good you are lucky
(hmm)
!wah!
I know right
then you gonna do part time right also
<malay> kau [dah] <malay> carik (err) part time <malay> punya kerja
what's your opinion of COVID like do you enjoy like the part like quarantine
no actually <malay> aku enjoy [seh]
because like (err) <malay> kau tau aku [lah] <malay> aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home [lah] because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though [lah] I can still understand so okay [lah] but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like <malay> aku [kan] <malay> pemalu [kan] so [dah] [lah] <malay> nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard [ah] through teams all
even the teachers was having trouble for some like they don't know how to use teams yeah funny [sia]
yeah
yeah I feel like I I thought more in class like real class yes yes yes
so like it was a very tough year four especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud [lah]
year for us especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud of us yeah
[ha] is it
yeah
<malay> itu [ah]
[a'ah]
!hais!
quite manageable <malay> tapi macam one or two modules <malay> susah sebab ada maths yeah <malay> susah sikit [lah] (hmm)
but <malay>alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
yeah
yeah
then <malay> kadang kadang macam
<malay> macam (err) <malay> kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
yeah
(hmm) honestly I want to <malay> kerja tapi (err) my parents <malay> nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind <malay> tapi nak kena tengok result <malay> dulu [lah] cause you know uni [kan] <malay> susah sikit [kan] like you have to be at least three point five and <malay> walaupon macam three point five <malay> pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so <malay> macam aku pon takut [lah] but at the same time also <malay> aku tak tahu nak buat course <malay> apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own [lah] but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
I'll think about it as you know the days goes by and when we graduate I think I will probably have made my decision by them yeah
(hmm)
all gone already right
[a'ah]
(hmm)
<malay> pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
[oh] yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to <malay> kerja kat office I think that is so <malay> macam stressfull because you have to deal with <malay> orang lain some <malay> orang tak [kan] <malay> macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring [lah] from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama <malay> padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her [lah] like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this [ah] the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want <malay> aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business <malay> tak tau [ah] <malay> nak buka business <malay> apa [eh]
yeah I don't know what what what is like trending now what's what do you think a good business actually now
[oh] yeah <malay> aku nak jual apa [seh]
but it's their used items right
[oh] I see
[oh] [oh] yeah yeah yeah
true
I think like my thought to choice will be either open a cafe or maybe sell something like I don't know some jugs any clothes you know
yeah but I feel like cafe will be like very nice you know yeah
[oh] my god we should open the cafe together
yes yes
<malay> tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner [ah] like rice everything right but there is also the bakery [kan] of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
full business like
like
yeah yeah and all
so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
yeah you know <malay> macam orang dulu dulu cakap start [jer] <malay> kecik apa <malay> sikit sikit nanti (err)
[a'ah]
yeah
yet
true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the <malay> dekat #bugis# <malay> semua jauh kita [kan] <malay> tinggal kat west [kan] <malay> habis cam cafe <malay> dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah
I think the west people will appreciate it
ya that's why we should like [oh] my god you know what you should do we should
also sell bubble tea at same time that's what will make us have money gain money yes
<malay> sekarang (err) <malay> makanan apa [ah] <malay> yang viral <malay> sekarang
what is the trending food right now <malay> apa apa [lah] <malay> apa apa
[oh]
same same
[oh] yeah <malay>dekat</malay> Liho <malay>pon ada</malay>
yeah but I've never tried [lah]
yeah
are you serious
you should do you are free right now
yes and it was successful it was so nice like the milk and everything it's very creamy it's like your coffee but it's like so creamy it's like at least you put whipped cream inside I mean technically is dalgona is actually whipped coffee [kan] yeah it's very nice [ah] you should try later you should do it later
<malay> kau ada kau ada
<malay>kau ada</malay> instant coffee
[ha] okay then <malay> kita boleh buat [ah] <malay> nanti
(hmm)
(err) I think brown sugar right like everything also have brown sugar then I see <malay> macam orang put the pearl <malay> dekat pancake or something <malay> macam semua benda nak kena ada pearl <malay> macam a bit <malay> merepek [lah]
yeah I mean <malay> aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay [lah] but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it <malay> macam merepek [ah] yeah
[oh]
(hmm)
is it nice
is it nice
[hor] [hor] [hor]
yeah
true we should go one day

it's gonna be a struggle for me but I do like <malay> macam #tempura# you know <malay> dengan nasi nasi those breaded kind of food is nice !duh! like I would defenitely want to try it like that because <malay> macam authentic [kan] <malay> macam sedap [ah] <malay> dengan dia punya japanese curry I've never try it

yeah
[oh] yes true like maybe they never clean their hands its a bit yeah I mean for at least the singapore singapore like the food standard the quality like when they were prepare the food I feel like we can trust them because it is very strict right they have to undergo like
you know all this
purpose so what's the good food there
yeah the certificate so I feel like yeah
everything is nice actually is like singapore [ah] but you know their food <malay> macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their <malay> nasi goreng can imagine [lah] <malay> macam very nice <malay> dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day
