okay dear (um)
just a question
we planned about going to korea south korea
<malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>nak pergi sana</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> you think that it's a <malay>macam</malay>
we should go there [lah] you know
aside from that
you sure you like korean food [ah]
I thought you don't
you don't like
(um)
<malay>macam</malay> fishy fishy stuff you know
but the problem is weather what if
it's cold
it's cold and you (uh) <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay> you know <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay>
so you are you are telling me that <malay>kita kena</malay> shop before <malay>kita pergi</malay> korea
no
that's not what you're supposed to do
but the question is when no [lah] kidding
let let let's leave that to later [lah] but
(um)
I the the thing is that I want to go there <malay>sebab</malay> I've been there
so
it's a place whereby I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tempat ini bagus untuk bawa</malay> partner [ah] you know
to have
a good time with my partner
so
ya that's why I wanna go there
I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> if there
they have #mukshidonna# there <malay>tapi</malay>
better than nothing right
but in korea
there will be a lots of walking
I'm not sure if you can <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tahan</malay>
there's not much escalator there's a lot of stairs
excuse me all the more we shouldn't bring a lot of stuff
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> shopping <malay>dekat sana</malay>
<malay>bawa benda</malay> bring light pack light [lah] you know
confirm <malay>berat</malay>
that's why you should pack light
so that you can shop more
that question
we shall leave it to our budget
no [lah]
since it's far right there's no point going for like like you know like a short trip
might as well like take a one week
trip you know since we are already there
or maybe more than one week
seven
I don't know what is that
but then again right
I wanna go there when it's winter <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm just afraid that <malay>kalau</malay>
you know [lah] <malay>kita tak tahan sejuk</malay>
I <malay>tak tahan</malay> but you know
I <malay>tak</malay> I I <malay>tak pernah</malay> experience snow you know so
what more if it's the first time with you
I get to experience snow
my first snowfall for my honeymoon
<malay>mana balik</malay> singapore <malay>demam</malay> if <malay>kalau dekat sana dah sejuk</malay> obviously you
(uh) you fall sick there
<malay>tak</malay> #shiok#
<malay>tak</malay> #shiok# [lah] <malay>siapa nak nak nak</malay> fall sick in on holiday [seh]
but I think you'll like it there [lah] <malay>sebab apa</malay> [eh]
there's a lot first thing there's a lot of cosmetics
and it's cheap
no it's not plastic surgery cosmetics like makeup stuff
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] brand brand <malay>itu semua sebab</malay>
korean brand [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream <malay>dengan</malay> face masks very cheap there
ya socks
face mask hand cream
innisfree
!huh! no no such thing
but <malay>banyak banyak</malay>
all those korean brands [ah] like etude house innisfree
<malay>dekat sana lebih murah</malay> [lah] compared to you <malay>sini</malay> [ah]
!ee! no
we concentrate on korea <malay>dulu [ah] apa cakap</malay> australia
that one might be after korea [lah]
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like <malay>macam</malay>
a road trip [tau] you know like <malay>macam</malay> you know melbourne [eh] like from sydney we drive down to other places
I don't know [ah]
like like
it's not
it's not really like from sydney to melbourne it's like let's say you drop in sydney then you go drive somewhere
or maybe from melbourne then you go drive somewhere
<malay>macam</malay> we get to see the <malay>apa itu</malay>
scenery twelve apostle's <malay>yang dia orang tengok itu semua</malay>
melbourne right [ah]
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay>
I'm not a good driver
I can drive
I can drive but I cannot
stay woke
they want to go but
that will take
another five years I <malay>rasa sebab nak kira-kira</malay> plan <malay>dua tahun</malay>
I <malay>dengar</malay> husband <malay>dia tengah ambil</malay>
so okay [lah]
I'm a trusted driver
I'm a safety driver you know I check my blindspot
I do my safety checks you know that kind of thing
provided provided if <malay>dia masih</malay> single [lah] <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin</malay> might
then cannot [lah]
by then <malay>dah ada anak [kan]</malay>
see how [lah] but but
see how [lah]
<malay>mana [lah] tahu dah kahwin longgar sikit</malay>
again [ah] this thing
what nonsense
what nonsense
excuse me
if it's just friend friend okay so don't touch more on personal side
okay let's go back to korea where we should be talking
ya but
or maybe if we go australia
we can
you can bring me there first [lah] [eh]
since you've been there you bring me there like
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that <malay>kita yang dapat tahu</malay>
