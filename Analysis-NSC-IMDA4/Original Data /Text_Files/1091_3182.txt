[eh] how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
<malay>ini yang kau cakap apa</malay>
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
<malay>bodoh</malay> [seh]
<malay>sedih</malay> [oh] <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>kau faham tak faham</malay> the question I give you one more chance I had to like <malay>balik</malay> and google <malay>apa ni</malay> aspiration <malay>aku tak ingat aku macam</malay> something like [oh] I want them to be inspired and [ah] like push themselves like for their art and creativity and with their talent set or with the skill set that I have I want to pass it on to the trainees
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so (err) intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic [what] two people [ah] and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
<malay>penat penat</malay> [seh] <malay>asyik kau kerja</malay>
<malay>bila kau</malay> start <malay>kerja baru ini</malay> fourteen december <malay>berapa minggu</malay> [jer]
excited the place is near your house <malay>kenapa tak mana kerja aku</malay> cause <malay>di sini</malay> [sia] <malay>ada macam</malay> some kind of progression
which is good
<malay>kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini</malay> !wow! that's fast [ah]
(mm) yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
(mm)
yes
!wah! that's that's okay too [kan]
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course [lah] once you are married you also want to have your own property too
so moving back into like your (um) <malay>cakap siapa tadi</malay>
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work [lah] for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though (um)
okay [lah] I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
<malay>bila dia orang boleh masuk</malay> singapore
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
<malay>apa tu barang</malay> fashion <malay>ke barang</malay> household <malay>rumah ke barang</malay> fashion <malay>jenama</malay> fashion <malay>orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>orang beli</malay> bag <malay>warna-warna buat apa</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa ribu</malay>
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking !wah! I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating (err) calorie counting app [lah] I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it [lah] okay
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so <malay>bodoh</malay> of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
that was so <malay>bodoh</malay> of me
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
later you help me out <malay>tolong aku</malay> I seriously feel so <malay>bodoh</malay> realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
[oh]
shoes I thought you like shoes
[oh]
[eh] but you will be more at the office part right
!huh! you have to also track just in case they need to run out
[oh]
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
really really except for those who are working shifts and <malay>dekat</malay> the
the duty area
finally after so long of working shifts <malay>penat</malay> [seh] <malay>kerja</malay> shift
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons [lah] but the thing is
<malay>bagus berharap kau boleh</malay> stay <malay>kat</malay> this job <malay>lama</malay> I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down <malay>ke apa ke</malay> and it's always like unexpected suddenly
<malay>dia cakap besok semua</malay> try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed [eh] I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily [ah]
but I think my weakness is <malay>makan asyik pergi makan</malay> [jer] as much as <malay>nak buat melipat</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> need to plan for the week
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days [oh] okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job [ah]
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
(err) there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping [one] but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth [ah] I think <malay>kena makan</malay> for like <malay>tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk</malay> the
[oh] okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
fifty dollars for the (um) the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses <malay>punya</malay> routine to relieve menses <malay>tu</malay>
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments [lah] this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay>
but but <malay>dia cakap kalau boleh makan</malay> more <malay>sayur-sayur</malay> but <malay>sayur pun kalau bagus</malay> like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food <malay>pedas-pedas tak boleh</malay> you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat <malay>pedas punya makanan</malay> because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet <malay>susu pun sama</malay> but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house [lah] we all cook this interesting dish [lah] so it tasted like those #kung# #pao# chicken so instead of using <malay>santan</malay> the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use <malay>macam</malay> make up for it <malay>macam</malay> it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually [kan] I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based (um) their kidney <malay>macam</malay> feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> quite a high stage diabetic [lah] then he had to (err) inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like <malay>macam</malay> too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that <malay>cara nak masak pula</malay> because we are so used to like <malay>masakan melayu masakan</malay> wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs [what] other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some <malay>buah-buahan</malay>
too <malay>manis</malay> yes but some <malay>buah</malay> got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
but okay [lah] I mean I found some recipes online so (err) chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff [lah] so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
<malay>nasi</malay> I <malay>makan nasi basmati</malay> so
<malay>penat</malay> because <malay>kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat</malay> three thirty [ah] <malay>menahan menahan</malay> taxi
no because I had to do some errands at home
I was stuck at home <malay>apa tu</malay> actually <malay>aku aku mahu</malay> see <malay>yang tu juga</malay> (mm) (mmhmm)
I know right you always take the bus early or late [oh] earlier <malay>lama dia</malay> then what did you do take train
[oh] where's her workplace [oh] area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
creamy meatball are there any other <malay>sayur</malay> inside your bowl
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else [ah] yes can request [ah]
!wow! <malay>mana ada ini</malay> [oh] I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place [ah] I don't like the inside [ah] so <malay>busuk</malay> cause I sat near the kitchen so <malay>sempit</malay>
<malay>benda leceh saya nak buat</malay> actually
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with (uh) this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
<malay>buat</malay> basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
<malay>nak perlu</malay> impact [oh] <malay>habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia</malay>
<malay>kau cakap apa</malay>
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
[kan] <malay>lepas tu dia cakap macam</malay> kind of (um) okay no
yes [lah] all the effort
hello
<malay>masa itu masa itu emas</malay> time is golden
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
she ask me that you haven't <malay>kahwin</malay> that time I thought you <malay>kahwin</malay> already then she ask <malay>kat apa</malay>
she say that time I fall down only I <malay>kahwin</malay> next year <malay>aku kau</malay>
what's that
[oh]
<malay>mana tahu dia orang tak tahu</malay>
want to be what <malay>dia cakap</malay>
who's that <malay>siapa tanya</malay>
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
you have to plan [lah] all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something [ah] you are so convinced to buy the item !wah! the person say <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] this one okay [ah] I try also
actually okay
maybe they are selective [lah] yes <malay>yang macam cakap boleh bagus</malay>
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food <malay>makan sedap</malay> [jer] then what about those like unhealthy
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy [lah] to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch <malay>asyik-asyik makan</malay> sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew <malay>apa</malay> I mean it must be strong in #kimchi# flavour
<malay>besok kerja sepuluh</malay>
#onigiri# #onigiri#
<malay>kenyang tak</malay> why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up [oh] just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
[ah] we wanted to eat sushi salmon #mentaiko# I think I'll just order that when we go to #hei# sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon #mentaiko#
it wasn't that bad but okay [lah] yes #ramen# spot is the best like <malay>kat mana</malay> opposite #lau pa sat# <malay>kasih</malay> area #gyudon#
