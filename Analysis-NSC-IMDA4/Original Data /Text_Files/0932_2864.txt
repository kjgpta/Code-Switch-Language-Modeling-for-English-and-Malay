most of my job
either work from home or face to face [ah] I preferred <malay>tapi</malay>
also depending [lah] like cause I'm doing project right like I said then <malay>macam</malay>
prefer face to face [lah] so that we

projects so basically (uh) <malay>kalau ada apa apa</malay>
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that [oh] I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it [lah]
(mm)
you can say that (uh) I do
I do mostly the front end
it's called and design [lah]
so ya not not if you see
[oh]
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture [kan]
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people [lah] so
ya ya you know the <malay>kalau</malay>
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call [eh] hi how (um)
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
<malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] it's better to do face to face [ah] you know like <malay>lincah</malay> can just
look at the computer and then there's
do (uh) [oh] ya
whatever [lah] right now <malay>pun</malay>
we cannot complain much [ah] because
COVID [mah]

[ah] I just want to
don't you feel like
it's a bit suffocating <malay>kalau</malay> you stay at home work from home
you lacking the human interaction
(uh)
<malay>macam tak dapat jumpa kawan</malay>

she got stable job she's she's (um)
she don't have to
[oh] she's not
she's a
[oh] so right now she's also finding for job [lah]
<malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] there's some source of income [lah]
but I think <malay>kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam</malay>
ya considered a luxury [ah] because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims [what] so we do have to you know
go the proper way <malay>kena ada majlis perkahwinan</malay>
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then (uh)
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really [ah] that one I don't know [sia]
that one that one I don't know [sia] I don't know I don't actually know how it works <malay>kalau</malay> your partner is a non-muslim
[oh] really [ah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>ada benda macam gini</malay>
what how long already
you and your

<malay>kau orang dua</malay>
(uh) I don't think so
no I don't <malay>tak tak ingat pun</malay> you <malay>ada cakap</malay>
almost three years
(mm)
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents <malay>kalau</malay> your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
[oh] my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because (err) my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and (err) ya cause I
[kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there [ah] I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
so I I tend to neglect <malay>kalau ada</malay>
(um) like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
(uh huh)
(mm)
ya [lah] I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
(um) you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
get the wedding cause some people they get married first <malay>kahwin dulu</malay> [ah] then
<malay>tak ada rumah nak tinggal</malay>
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded [lah]
ya I just <malay>nak keluar rumah</malay> you know have your own
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl [ah] then they expect a lot of you
female
get out [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you (uh) get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
#zao# #zao#
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
well okay [lah] actually
[oh]

my boyfriend's place is just (um)
just enough for his family [ah] I cannot really move into his place

ya my
my brother <malay>pun nak kahwin</malay> [kan] end of december I I hope
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
cause like <malay>kecoh</malay>

in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
it's quite scary [lah] <malay>kalau balik malam-malam</malay> then
you will be scared [lah] because

those (um) touch and run away kind
ya then <malay>ada juga</malay> (uh) <malay>pencuri</malay> which is

when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house [kan]
I take I walk from pioneer
then I <malay>jalan balik</malay>
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that (uh) people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know (uh)
they even take he even took the same lift as me

you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
ya my parents on <malay>gila</malay> [lah] you know they are all in all these
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know [lah]
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough

I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person

anxious over crowds

I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so #jurong# staying at #jurong# west is quite fitting for me [lah] you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in #jurong# west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
