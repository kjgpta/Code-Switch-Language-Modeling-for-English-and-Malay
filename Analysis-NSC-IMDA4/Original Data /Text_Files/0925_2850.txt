if I don't
work under healthcare then it's either health in it's either healthcare or (um) (um) <malay>apa ni</malay>

so if childcare I have to go back study
but
to think of the money as well
ya [lah] but see [lah] how
(mmhmm)
(um) (um) <malay>ada</malay> not not all [eh] <malay>ada ada ada</malay>
<malay>kakak aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tanya</malay> because <malay>itu semua dekat</malay> they all <malay>dekat ni</malay> #paya lebar#
you know the #paya lebar# <malay>punya</malay> there's a one the one that we took the yes there's the one that we took the food hygiene course yes over there
so it's over there but okay [lah] I think it's quite
okay yes
because what my friend say we can
study also if <malay>bayar</malay> you know the whatever the (um)
during secondary school <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount of money [oh] the
ya that thing then they can deduct so after deduction I think you can just pay like a few hundred
by the age of twenty five I want to get marry girl
and I see [lah] you see [lah] I work continue health care until I get pregnant
<malay>lepas</malay>
healthcare you if you until pregnant the benefit is good
(um) that's more benefit
if not then
(um) ya true if not
then I will see [lah] if my pay still the same no increment no ya not like
no increase in anything then
find new job [lor] either go back admin
that's the thing admin actually earn a lot <malay>cuma</malay> my previous work is
<malay>merepek</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] ya still you bring home a lot [leh] but it okay she go means
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
because I know admin also even under maritime <malay>ada yang</malay> travel because my cousin under admin also I didn't know [lah] but I know when her maritime also she is
say <malay>apa ni</malay> because you also travelling
(uh)
so she don't have to move
!whoa! but then she got to study law
filing
admin is a good thinking back then
you need to think a lot [ah] ya I want the two years experience and then see how
cause a lot of people also picking like child from there it's it is
[oh] my god speaking of that
<malay>aku ada</malay> doctor <malay>baru</malay> [seh]

to think of until it is to happen ya and then when it all start to happen
but like everybody thank you okay if I were to find this job I have to think of the
future what if what if if I find this job what if what if also
