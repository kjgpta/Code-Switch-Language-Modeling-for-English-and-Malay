(uh) I'm like it require three months <malay>aku tiga bulan</malay> [dah] <malay>start sekolah ape kalau gitu</malay>
!hais!
(mm)
(uh)
[oh] yeah yeah I saw

I don't I I (err) <malay>boleh boleh tanya orang lain</malay>
[oh] (err) <malay>ada</malay> [lah] or
yeah
yeah I think they will be on if they're free
yeah
(mm)
(uh) that's true
(uh)
ya because they <malay>tengok</malay> a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try <malay>nak cuba</malay>
[oh] yeah yeah
[oh] yeah that's right
[ah]
[oh] my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press <malay>dia punya butang</malay> after that he hide the body behind him
then the guy just continue walking
yeah like cause I was like that's genius
I mean if
yeah they said if the other person actually went up to him confirm get caught already then I was like !wah! very lucky
[oh]
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
I think it's more interesting than Mafia game [lor]
(uh)
[oh] yeah that's (err)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay> !wah! I miss playing night games with people
yeah
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO <malay>atau</malay> Among Us then I'm like
it's always so funny
yeah
(ugh) same
nope
<malay>bukan tak boleh tak suka ada beza</malay>
(err) all meat but I can still eat <malay>daging lembu</malay> yes
yeah because <malay>daging lembu selalu macam</malay> they have this smell
yeah yeah and then <malay>tak boleh tahan</malay> it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
(mm)
I mean <malay>tak boleh</malay> predict [pe] so
then he will be like what !huh! who are you
yeah especially since (err) <malay>nanti</malay> the fish will <malay>macam bau ja hanyir</malay> so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
I mean (err)
I mean (err) I mean if you want to eat fish when you're pregnant is more unlikely
[oh] my gosh
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
[eh]
<malay>nak</malay> but then
<malay>bila nak pergi</malay> what's the plan
(oo)
twenty eight <malay>agak</malay> near [lah] <malay>kena</malay> check again
(mm) okay
okay yeah my poly friends also <malay>dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke</malay> they all already start uni
<malay>tak sekolah lain-lain</malay> [seh]
(err) I think different different courses (hmm)
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang nak jumpa makan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak jumpa belajar then I'm like <malay>kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama</malay>
yeah then <malay>macam</malay> guys move on
that's why then I <malay>macam</malay> !aiya! whatever [lah] it's up to them then next week [ah] <malay>minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa</malay> then they were like [oh] <malay>kita tunggu untuk</malay> Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then [eh] I just open the chat <malay>habis tu</malay> I [kan] I just say (mm) (err) you guys go ahead I'm not free
I mean yeah but like I don't have
yes
yeah
then the <malay>makanan</malay> they all want to eat also <malay>selalu dia orang nak minta makanan</malay> I <malay>tak boleh makan</malay>
then I go they change the plan then I feel bad [what] then it's like (uh) just go ahead [lah] without me
yeah
(um) yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
yeah cause <malay>dengan</malay> our secondary school friends <malay>kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu</malay> [pe] <malay>selalu</malay> it's very easy for us to settle food [what]
yeah then is don't know [lah] is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like [oh] let's eat Umisushi then okay <malay>aku tak boleh makan</malay>
then they were like never mind [lah] you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
yeah it's like [oh] let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right <malay>habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama</malay>
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
same is like they
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like <malay>penat</malay> [seh] why did I go out I regret going out of the house
[oh] my god yeah
exactly [oh] my god (ugh)
but how [seh] that time I topped up twenty dollar then I think I only went out like four or five times only then finishing then I'm like !huh!
(err)
yeah
that's like
(mm)
(mm)
I think so like that like that's what I remember
I mean
<malay>boleh</malay> experiment then you see <malay>mana satu lagi murah</malay>
then it depends on your station also [lah]
(mm)
(uh) yeah #aigoo# [dah] [lah] <malay>tak ada kerja habis tu</malay> bus fare <malay>pun mahal</malay> !hais!
[oh] I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey <malay>dia punya</malay> yeah
I think it's a very how to say [ah] first world problem I feel
(mmhmm)
right yeah
(mm) yeah
that's true
I
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems [lah] like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible <malay>punya</malay> bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
exactly then that's why I think it's considered a million dollar like idea I guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then I'm (mm)
no no you can
cause even for like <malay>macam orang yang tak boleh nampak</malay> like visual disability they have new apps <malay>macam</malay> the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
which is
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah
(mm) that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
(mm)
cause even for my school cause #Ngee An# [kan] <malay>ada</malay> that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability <malay>pun</malay> I there was this period of time I had like <malay>macam</malay> class right then every time if I reach school <malay>dekat</malay> this certain timing I will see that <malay>makcik</malay> that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad [lah] because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
(mm)
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened [lah] like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like (hmm) I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh forest no <malay>tak dengar</malay> [eh]
<malay>bagus</malay>
!wah! was the forest fire <malay>macam</malay> bad
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
[oh] my gosh why <malay>apa gunanya</malay> gender reveal seriously
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
(mm)
[oh] my god can you imagine me
my parents thought I was a boy then when they give birth it was a girl yeah they really thought I was going to be in a boy it was so funny
like
[oh] that one I never ask so yeah
okay maybe I should ask is !wah!
it's !wah! ya
so funny
it's like
it's like a sike [eh] like [oh] it's a boy [oh] no it's a girl sike
I think gender reveal parties are very I don't know it's so over the top
it's over the top yeah
it's <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak</malay> it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
yeah it's
I guess maybe we have different values like <malay>untuk kita</malay> if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
I don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that I have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah I'm like (um)
[ah] yeah
(mm)
yeah yeah
(mm)
(mm)
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
[ah] yeah yeah
(err)
I mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
(uh) yeah
(mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh] my gosh
then
then then it's like should I be sad that there's no customers or should I be glad that there's no customers
(mm)
very easy money
(hmm)
I mean that's considered one of a good like working days I guess
(uh) yeah
that's true
[oh]
[oh]
!oof!
(uh)
!wah! [ah] speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she (mm) baked <malay>untuk</malay> your birthday !wah! I still think of it sometimes
right I'm still amazed that she did it [eh]
you are the one who made it
like
(uh)
I mean
(mm) understand
[ah]
(mmhmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah cause I mean I think the cake <malay>macam</malay> dry because [dah] <malay>simpan satu hari</malay> [pe] [dah] <malay>potong</malay> then you give it to them the next day but !wah! the whipped cream I was so amazed cause <malay>selalu</malay> whipped cream [kan] <malay>diorang buat</malay> cake is either <malay>macam banyak sangat</malay> then too sweet or like the whipping cream <malay>macam</malay> how to say ya <malay>macam berminyak</malay> is that the word like
yeah then is like you're like (uh) what is this [ah] then you scrape the frosting off
yeah
yeah that's true
that's why when we were bringing the cake in it's like !wah! Kelly the cake is so pretty
yeah
yeah don't cause you messaged me <malay>habis tu</malay> you messaged <malay>dengan orang lain</malay> [kan] and we were like (err) <malay>dia tak</malay> [kan] <malay>beli</malay> cake [kan] like (err) (err) (err)
that's why when you asked me <malay>kalau nak</malay> cake then I like I like cake but <malay>kalau aku bilang aku nak</malay> cake <malay>nanti kau beli macam mana</malay>
(uh)
yeah
no she panic cause <malay>yang</malay> when you were working together <malay>yang ada satu hari ni</malay> then after that <malay>kita</malay> send message then you <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> handphone [kan] then <malay>dia</malay> [eh] guys #Nisha# <malay>pakai aku punya</malay> handphone then we were like [oh] did she see the chat
yeah when you guys were working
!aiya! [lah] but it was just you know in case
then
yeah then we <malay>ni</malay> we panic right then <malay>kita tukar dia punya</malay> group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
right
yeah right I felt smart
that's why
and then I was like (err) what's Kelly's (um) faculty
and that's how we were discussing what to get for you
yeah
you know the round card right okay sorry side track but you know released (err) !wah! you know this whole week I think everyday right I think four days in a week right it released new merchandise then that one I don't care never mind
then they released like (err) new like product live for their documentary like their staycation documentary then the
yeah [eh] I can <malay>pinjam</malay> you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one <malay>kena bayar</malay>
it's it's super hilarious macam you you <malay>boleh nampak</malay> their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
(err) sekarang [dah] <malay>ada empat</malay> if you want to include macam behind the scenes <malay>ada lapan</malay> in total
ya it's the weverse the the the the new fan cafe that one
yeah yeah it's so funny [ah] (ugh)
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the <malay>cawan</malay> was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got <malay>cawan</malay> I was like
is is like your cup <malay>nya</malay> design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
in the SOOP
merchandise you can just Google
yeah I think they're trying to bring in money [lah]
a lot you know they are re-releasing the you know Skool Luv Affair album the repackaged version
right I was like [oh] okay no no no no no I don't need
don't tell me I don't have the money to do that this month
right it's (ugh) and it's not very like <malay>macam</malay> merchandise is you
yeah
yeah that's why
!wah! you know the only time <malay>yang diorang letak diorang punya muka</malay> right the I think is the merchandise I was like <malay>nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas</malay>
I mean if you have the self-confidence and the self-esteem to wear it out go ahead girl or guy or whatever
(mm)
yeah they picked a very pretty shade of green then I was like genius
(mm)
!wah! yeah
twenty one is like the success is you can't even compare [leh]
it's
even people who are not their fans right see it and like [oh] is cute buys
[oh] I didn't know that okay
(mm) I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in <malay>punya bantal</malay [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> soft toy then I like
yes and it fits the aesthetic
(mm)
[oh] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the #chibi# the tiny #Tan# [oh] my god [oh] I wanted to get their things and then after that <malay>aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya</malay> shipping fee then I'm like
<malay>sudah</malay>
(ugh)
(ugh) don't even get me started on shipping (ugh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!oof!
<malay>dia punya</malay> shipping <malay>macam boleh beli tiga dia punya</malay> product [tau] I was like (ugh)
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
if
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right <malay>dia punya</malay> shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
yeah [lah] what's the point if I never buy the membership kit if I signed up
so I was like the thing I do for you guys
(mm)
what thing
[oh] no no no that one change already cause that one is <malay>diorang punya</malay> old style
you want to level up <malay>untuk dapat lebih banyak benda</malay> you must do the quiz and fill up the test
<malay>tak dia</malay> this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
<malay>tapi bodoh</malay> [lah] just <malay>tak</malay> you spend like <malay>ape</malay> thirty dollars just to <malay>kacau orang</malay> on the website
that's why it's like you the thirty dollar you don't want to use for other things
right !wah! the thirty dollar I think I can buy my whole new outfit that I've been looking at [leh]
well <malay>nak beli</malay> this <malay>macam</malay> sweater it's a knitted sweater [lah] then I also looking at this skirt
yeah Shopee [lah] what where else can I buy I am not that rich
yeah (err) I think the skirt <malay>dalam dua belas</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay>
yea yeah
yeah then the
<malay>tak</malay> it's just I want to save up the money first
(uh) yeah
because the shipping is only <malay>macam dalam dua tiga</malay> dollar <malay>gitu aje</malay> not much
yeah
!aiya!
okay can I will share to you
that's why and I feel bad for using fast fashion but is what I can afford so yeah
yeah cause <malay>macam</malay> it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse <malay>punya</malay> factory [lah] so yeah
(mm)
yeah
yeah
yeah
(mm)
yeah
okay
(err) I think
<malay>dah boleh</malay> off
