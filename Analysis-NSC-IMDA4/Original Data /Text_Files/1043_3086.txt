watch any movie anytime anywhere
(uh) and you also
can watch your favourite anime <malay>tapi</malay> depends [ah]
sometimes not all the show that you want <malay>ada dekat dalam</malay>
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite (uh) show or anime
so now
<malay>apa cerita</malay> you <malay>tengok dekat</malay>
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
<malay>tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun makan</malay>
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
yes so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> my class start at eight
(um)
the latest that I arrive <malay>paling lambat</malay> I think <malay>pukul lapan</malay>
[eh] (um)
sorry
<malay>sepuluh</malay>
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
<malay>tapi</malay> I will try my best to come school early next time
then (uh) maybe
<malay>cuba juga</malay> improve my
grades
and (um)
now I have a lot of projects so <malay>tengah nak habiskan semua</malay>
(uh)
so when do you graduate
two years
<malay>lama</malay> [seh]
(um)
I only left with
four months
(um) then after four months
I think <malay>nak</malay> apply <malay>kerja</malay>
then
(um) just
work
then (uh) if there's
(uh) school school (uh) if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari duit</malay>
so it's best for me to work
(err) <malay>bulan depan</malay>
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about (uh)
(uh) money anymore
I
okay with
<malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>cakap tadi</malay> [ah]
because (uh)
<malay>dalam masa depan pun</malay> I think will continue my studies
but ya
good that (uh) I have a friend like you
(err) that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
<malay>apa</malay> you join
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
<malay>tak tak tahu kenapa</malay> also I join then when I was sec three
my <malay>kawan</malay> (uh) all <malay>ajak</malay> me go
join rugby
and that's where I grew my interest <malay>dengan</malay> rugby
so I've
played rugby
<malay>dah masuk sepuluh tahun</malay>
ya so
rugby (err)
is with me since (uh) secondary school
and now I'm in a (uh) club
(uh) #tamoko# lions
I <malay>anggap</malay> rugby as a
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
whenever <malay>nak pergi</malay> training
I can see on my (uh)
meets
ya
(uh) I recently got injured because of my bad leg
so <malay>bila kaki tu</malay> injured
(uh) <malay>kena pergi</malay> doctor
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that (uh) nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
[orh]
(um) when I was young I like extreme sport
(um)
so <malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>kecil tu</malay> my bicycle
<malay>tapi</malay> is not your normal bicycle is like
(err) then (uh)
secondary school I go to
(err)
skatepark and I like skateboarding
so <malay>daripada situ</malay> I pick up (uh) skateboarding also
so I play <malay>dengan</malay> skateboard together
(uh) hopefully that
<malay>tak ada</malay> break any bones because I want to continue playing
<malay>dengan</malay> skateboard and also maybe hopefully
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> [lah] (um) play rugby in another ten years
(um)
speaking of commitments (uh) I think
(err)
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
we live our life together <malay>sama-sama</malay> in <malay>dalam satu rumah</malay> happily
(um) I think
they are having confusion about phase three
<malay>tapi</malay> I hope that phase three is coming soon because <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak mahu cakap pasal</malay> mask
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
<malay>dalam bas</malay>
then when you breathe and there's fog <malay>dekat cermin mata</malay>
you know how terrible that is
I can't wear contact lens <malay>takut</malay>
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
<malay>bila</malay>
my <malay>kawan</malay> like
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
I <malay>pun tak sabar nak</malay> (uh) <malay>habiskan ini</malay> COVID
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably (err) go out in an adventure
ya <malay>sedih bila dengar</malay> Teo Heng is closing down
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news [ah] fake news
so (uh) I really want to go karaoke with my friends [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (um) if it's not karaoke
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak pergi main bola dengan</malay> my <malay>kawan</malay>
[oh] of course I want to <malay>keluar dengan</malay> my family
(uh) <malay>ajak dia orang pergi</malay> dinner (um)
and for my girlfriend (uh) probably go out on a date
you know (uh) <malay>pergi</malay>
somewhere (uh) and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
[oh]
<malay>tak pernah dengar pasal</malay> hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher <malay>tu boleh buat untuk</malay> staycation
(uh) anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
[oh] ya (um) actually
<malay>dah lama</malay> plan
(err) go staycation at least
ease off my mind off (uh) <malay>jauh dari rumah</malay> at least you know
meet somewhere that <malay>macam</malay>
I have never been before so at least
(uh) <malay>boleh</malay> relax my mind
[oh] (uh)
<malay>bila</malay> I go wild wild wet
(um)
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
<malay>kita pergi</malay> wild wild wet but actually it's different because
<malay>kena</malay> lineup time (uh) the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people <malay>dekat dalam</malay> you only can go one round
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
<malay>boleh</malay> enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go #sentosa#
(uh) go beach with my family and
<malay>agaknya</malay>
cannot <malay>agaknya</malay> bring my girlfriend along
and (uh) you know swim
<malay>dekat sana</malay>
(um) actually <malay>tak pernah pergi sana</malay> but I hope to try
(um) I'm not afraid of heights
are you
(um)
like just now <malay>bila</malay>
I <malay>cakap</malay> I don't like (uh) I mean I like heights right
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
I <malay>takut</malay>
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
<malay>bila dia tengah naik</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
(um) I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
<malay>tapi</malay> no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] similar
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube (err) like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
<malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> [lah] because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and <malay>nak cuba</malay>
drifting
and
<malay>agaknya kalau boleh</malay>
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
(uh) I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
(um) my favourite car is
(uh)
(uh)
there's <malay>satu</malay> specific
that I <malay>suka</malay>
it's a M three (uh) I <malay>tahu</malay> you don't like cars but
(uh) is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
ya actually <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
my favourite car is mostly (uh) japanese
for example (uh) Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
(um)
<malay>tak tipu</malay> actually is one of my favourite
#tokyo# drift <malay>punya cerita</malay> (uh) in all the movies
#tokyo# drift is one of them
[ah] actually
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>percaya</malay> there's nine fast and furious movie
but I only watch till
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so <malay>macam dah malas nak tengok</malay>
and I watch (uh)
way before [ah]
(uh) nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because (uh) he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
ya <malay>macam</malay> for me
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>boleh suka bola</malay> like
<malay>semenjak kecil</malay> (uh)
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
(err) like twenty years
in fact that
<malay>semua</malay> of my family
support the same club
(uh) yes <malay>ada</malay> baby pictures of me wearing a
man united shirt
(um)
actually I <malay>suka</malay> club too because of the history
and (uh) the manager himself that (uh) brought man untied to win (uh)
twenty titles
man U
<malay>dah tak macam dulu</malay>
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
(uh) they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win (uh) all the (uh) season
and (err) what I heard recently
(uh) but it's <malay>datang</malay> from a rival club [ah]
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
<malay>bagus juga untuk dia orang</malay>
after like how many years <malay>dia orang menang</malay> club (uh) cup
(um) I'm not being a hater <malay>tapi macam</malay> I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
while man U have already won twenty times
if
<malay>kalau tak nak pergi kerja</malay> you can always take <malay>tapi kalau dah ambil</malay>
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] rest <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
(uh) probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya (uh) (um)
hards hard time has to come first <malay>baru</malay>
easy life <malay>baru datang</malay> so don't expect everything to be easy
(mm)
ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I also
<malay>harap</malay> that everything will
(err)
go back into the normal state [lah]
and <malay>boleh dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh dapat kerja senang</malay>
and everybody starts to work normally and (uh) (uh)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> everybody at (uh) live their normal life after that
ya
I hope that good news <malay>akan datang</malay>
<malay>kalau tak</malay> we will if <malay>orang tak</malay> (uh)
stick to the (uh) rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
<malay>akan datang</malay> [ah]
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best
