[oh] like how is it
<malay>tapi korang ada pernah macam</malay> (uh) fight <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
so far <malay>belum</malay> [ah] (mm) okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan] so cannot really meet each other that much <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] but how frequently <malay>tu</malay>
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
but like for me I remember <malay>bila</malay> I was dating [kan] (uh) we meet everyday <malay>sebab sama sekolah apa</malay> so <malay>kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama</malay> in the weekends so <malay>hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka</malay> so <malay>bila kahwin</malay> I also know that <malay>takkan jelak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak serik</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] <malay>dah dah</malay> come on [ah] <malay>dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu</malay> should be fine [lah] [kan]
[oh] you met the the mum
okay
[eh] <malay>panggil dia apa makcik cik</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>lepas tu makcik tu cakap apa</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] <malay>jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi dah</malay> it's like coincidence <malay>ke atau memang nak jumpa dia</malay>
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau</malay> like <malay>atau tak kasi dia jumpa</malay> you
[eh]
[oh] ya ya ya [oh] <malay>dia tak tahu</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> [jer] <malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>asal dia tak bilang</malay>
right
ya <malay>macam</malay> why he why he like want to like keep it secret [seh]
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
okay so do you guys like <malay>macam</malay>
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then <malay>kalau</malay> like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know [ah] middle chair honestly I don't know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
problem with that so far <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
[oh] [eh] <malay>apa bara api tu</malay> scary <malay>juga tu nanti kalau</malay> like if one of you all like <malay>marah habis</malay> [sia] <malay>dua-dua</malay> volcano [seh]
[oh]
so like your chinese [one] your you you're what [ah] tiger right ya tiger <malay>memang</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>bara api gitu</malay> tiger fierce
<malay>tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa</malay> so <malay>baru tiga bulan</malay> so you don't know [lah] like
I think it will take a while [lah]
one year
K [lah]
(um) I think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
cause for me and my husband <malay>kalau kita kita dah jumpa</malay> everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months <malay>kita macam dah tahu</malay> each other <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
like
fight that okay I did something wrong then <malay>kita orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>kita mesti cakap</malay> [ah] like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys <malay>dia sekarang sekolah</malay> right so he <malay>berapa tahun lagi</malay> [eh]
right ya so he is
[oh] he's just a normal [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> honours [lah]
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) four years so <malay>dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>dia belajar apa</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
[oh] first year already <malay>tak</malay> surviving [oh] <malay>rabak hancur</malay> [seh]
exam exam [ah] okay so <malay>dia sekarang</malay> end of the first year
(mm) so
if he <malay>pergi</malay> counselling the course counselling he might have to restart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
three four more years with something you don't like [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> exams means you have to study for it
(mm)
[oh]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] and he's still so young he's like what twenty five [kan] so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter [ah] ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then <malay>lagi rabak</malay> then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
I think <malay>macam dia kena fikir betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia kalau dia nak</malay> continue <malay>ke atau dia nak</malay>
like <malay>tukar ke</malay> because like one year is still okay <malay>tapi bila dah</malay> two years <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then I think that's when it's (err) there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay [lah] <malay>kalau nak tukar</malay> right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like <malay>kalau</malay> in in so actually <malay>kalau</malay> some people right they will (uh) come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first <malay>sebab lagi senang</malay> but you waste one year [lah] but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
(uh) (uh) so like <malay>macam gitu pun boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if you want because a lot of people <malay>kat</malay> poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like (err) some course that they don't like like engineering <malay>gitu</malay> then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma <malay>yang dorang nak</malay> and then after <malay>dorang masuk</malay> then they get to go [ah] so it for them is like (um) ya you you sacrifice one year [ah] to do what you want then so you can think of it like that <malay>gitu</malay>
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay so <malay>dia dah tapi dia</malay> electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff <malay>asal dia tak pergi</malay> digipen
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya I mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] I mean that's what I would do [lah]
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for <malay>ada</malay> [tau] art design on media that [one] at least [ah] there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that [one] that time <malay>[kan]</malay> she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want [lah] so [eh] I mean I feel like
(um) I'm okay <malay>tapi</malay> I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so <malay>macam</malay> I felt like I needed to work or at least do something [ah] like not school for once <malay>gitu</malay>
ya pretty much even though like <malay>kat</malay> uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff <malay>tapi</malay> then I went back so ya then I think
I think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right (um) what I heard from my classmates [ah] <malay>yang dah dorang bekerja</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun</malay> [ah] at the most <malay>sepuluh tahun gitu</malay> then <malay>dorang</malay> come back to like get just get a degree <malay>dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis</malay> like an essay like how to write essay all that <malay>dorang dah lupa</malay>
ya so (um) that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it <malay>gitu</malay>
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words <malay>apa</malay>
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
<malay>berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>berapa tahun</malay>
(mm)
[oh] <malay>satu</malay> [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
when
ya
<malay>lepas kahwin</malay> <malay>betul-betul nak kahwin dulu</malay> [eh]
[oh] is there a reason why you want to like <malay>kahwin</malay> first
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
(um) in terms of stress [kan] <malay>lepas kahwin</malay> [eh] you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I <malay>kahwin</malay> and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like I felt very
(um) stressed out <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>nak</malay> our our mum she [ah] she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and <malay>ayah</malay> decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking <malay>gitu</malay> so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that [lah] I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
<malay>tapi takde apa-apa</malay> [ah] because [ah] <malay>kalau orang tanya pun</malay> I will just say [oh] my husband he's okay with <malay>apa</malay> so in the end religiously (uh) culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think [ah] so
<malay>kau siapa</malay> [seh]
so my <malay>suami</malay> is super like easy going <malay>dia faham</malay> everything I'm very honest to him
<malay>kalau</malay> I'm going to this place <malay>ke apa</malay> I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him [lah] I'm going to overnight <malay>kat tempat ni</malay> with my friends we just wanna chill <malay>kalau nak ikut ikut</malay> [ah] like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so <malay>kalau dia nak keluar ke apa</malay> with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding [lah] so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
<malay>kahwin</malay> ya
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
<malay>macam dorang punya gitu macam majlis dorang gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
<malay>malangnya</malay> I think you want like my kind of wedding
<malay>kampung</malay>
<malay>ulam</malay> [seh] <malay>kampung kat mana ni kampung apa</malay> malaysia
[oh]
#pulau ubin# <malay>dorang nak tutup apa</malay>
#semakau# <malay>pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi</malay>
<malay>kalau nak pergi kat</malay> malaysia <malay>kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak rapat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah]
filter <malay>kau</malay> block yourself you block yourself you know
<malay>kau</malay> block <malay>sendiri</malay> but then the rental will be insane
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] (uh) then (mm) #pulau ubin# is actually quite interesting for a wedding
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
#tuas# #tuas#
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
like like are they chinese <malay>ke</malay> malay <malay>ke</malay> [oh]
<malay>takde motor takde kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>bagus kau</malay>
<malay>dia jemput</malay> [jer] <malay>semua orang tapi</malay> actually <malay>tak jemput semua orang</malay> indirectly [lah]
<malay>orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat</malay> west <malay>kat</malay> east east so <malay>dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang</malay> (uh) (um) (uh) <malay>kat</malay> #tuas# <malay>situ kat</malay> #johor# <malay>masuk masuk</malay> [ah] #johor# <malay>masuk tapi kalau kau orang</malay> (uh) #tampines# #pasir ris# <malay>tak payah datang sudah</malay> waste your time
PayNow (uh) (uh) [seh]
so <malay>dorang kat sana kat mana dorang</malay> the <malay>majlis kat mana</malay>
clubhouse
okay
[oh] okay but it such a weird place [lah] to like get a get married at (uh) at #tuas#
ya I mean if you're up for #pulau tekong# [kan]
like I'm if you're if you're up for #pulau tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but I think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
is like you only go there <malay>kalau nak</malay> show off
[kan] like if you just want to show off <malay>cakap</malay> like you like you got a lot of money then okay [lah] #sentosa# [lah] but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore <malay>yang</malay> you can actually get
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) <malay>tapi ada</malay> timer [ah] <malay>dah</malay> reach <malay>dah</malay> reach harbourfront okay <malay>habis</malay> wedding <malay>habis</malay>
(uh) (uh) (uh) unless if unless if like you [ah] <malay>ambil</malay> the cruise ship <malay>yang pergi</malay> #batam# and back [ah] then okay got time <malay>tapi ada</malay> cruise <malay>yang sekarang</malay> they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back [lah] so <malay>kalau macam gitu susah sikit</malay> [ah]
and <malay>orang tak boleh datang</malay> like wherever they want they have to come <malay>bila bila</malay> cruise <malay>dia dah nak</malay> ship off <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] <malay>ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil</malay> [lah] <malay>sampan kau bawa sampan kau</malay> <malay>kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>nanti dorang dayung sampan</malay>
<malay>mesti makcik-makcik semua bising bila datang dorang cakap</malay>
!alamak! <malay>susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah</malay>
(uh) (uh) [seh]
I think at night [lah] we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then <malay>bila dah malam</malay> [kan] then we say [oh] (uh) all the <malay>makcik pergi tidur</malay> and stuff and then <malay>terus</malay> we got to the club and then <malay>terus</malay>
like like go all out [lah]
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
(uh) mocktail [lah] mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
(uh huh)
[oh] nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
[oh] okay okay okay
(mm)
ya I know
so you went with <malay>adik</malay>
okay so like what do you guys get
(uh) (uh)
brunch menu (mm)
buffet [jer] buffet [lah] buffet <malay>dia</malay> halal [lah]
(mm)
okay [lah] best [lah]
[oh] chilli crab <malay>pun ada</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then you barbecue yourself or what
[oh] K
[oh] K K ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya ya ya
[eh] but no barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go [ah] even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like (um)
even when it was (um)
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like [eh] is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so <malay>rabak</malay> so I didn't even K I didn't even like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(uh) (uh) but okay [lah] it was fun [lah] it was for once you get to feel like <malay>macam orang kaya gitu</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like ya that's it [lah] but I don't know [lah] like
<malay>kalau korang nak</malay> (um) <malay>pergi</malay> staycation <malay>ke tak</malay>
I know the <malay>kalau</malay> if the #d'kranji# here is
(um)
clean certified clean certified then maybe <malay>kita boleh pergi sana</malay>
cause there is like very secluded [kan] so it's a different experience <malay>gitu</malay> like out of city life
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
(uh) you and me will have this share the room and then he and <malay>abang</malay> #hafiz# will share [lah]
(uh) so <malay>kita halalkan</malay> [lah]
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
[oh] so <malay>susah tu</malay> but no if they like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(uh) (uh) a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause <malay>kalau</malay> if it's two #hafizes# I mean both <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
(uh) (uh) so I think <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like we we can do that but it depends [ah] like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm) january <malay>gitu</malay> okay
(mm)
ya [lah] but I mean okay [lah] we can we can always go <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is like you said [ah] must plan [lah] ya
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how how bad is it
it is
[oh] ya the one you told me <malay>yang dia</malay>
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
I mean <malay>dorang pun macam orang melayu</malay> [lah] you have to understand [lah] <malay>kita orang pun macam</malay> everything also <malay>macam</malay> relax <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kita macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak ikut sangat</malay> [ah] but
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
ya so I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> it will be really <malay>susah</malay> for them to
to get back up
ya
and indonesia <malay>pun teruk teruk</malay> [seh]
like indonesia is <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok dia punya</malay> cases
if
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya like I think like
indonesia is also like quite high death rate [kan] death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else <malay>gitu</malay>
so this is very scary [ah] like <malay>lagi dorang pun</malay> I don't think they care then they are so dense <malay>gitu</malay> the the country
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures [kan] (err) then (err) but for them <malay>dorang tak ada pun</malay> I mean <malay>kita bila</malay> we needed the extra space <malay>terus kita pergi tukar</malay> expo [lah] <malay>tukar</malay> all the places that we already have <malay>tapi tak pakai apa</malay> because COVID [kan] so we use that place to (um) immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> indonesia I think <malay>susah</malay> because [kan] singapore [kan] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>asyik</malay> #kiasu# [kan] <malay>kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau</malay> indonesia <malay>semua</malay> relax
<malay>dorang</malay> relax [jer] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] #kiasu# everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
like from what it looks they are not
(mm) (uh) <malay>dorang pun macam kalau mati mati</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sakit</malay> that's their thinking [ah] <malay>dah sakit apa sakit</malay> so <malay>kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi</malay>
so <malay>dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh</malay> (uh) manage [kan] all these things [ah] so it's very hard for them [ah] like india also is very very very bad
ya india is like one of the worst I think
ya ya ya <malay>yang teruknya</malay> [kan] a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour [ah] saying that it's
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
[a'ah] but like I feel like it's somewhat true because <malay>dorang</malay> really <malay>tak kesah</malay> for the for the old people
[ah] then like <malay>dorang macam</malay> they will only like take in like patients <malay>yang</malay> have a chance of survival
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like <malay>dulu punya</malay> america
ya during (um) last time when america was quite bad [kan] I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] but in india it's like that every day now
(mm)
ya
ya
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more <malay>tapi</malay> they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that <malay>kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan</malay> like
don't mess [lah] don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
ya <malay>tapi orang-orang tua dorang</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang dah cakap pakai</malay> mask and <malay>jangan</malay> (uh) <malay>jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak keluar keluar</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak jadi</malay>
(uh) (uh)
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so <malay>macam</malay> (um) there was this <malay>atuk</malay> not <malay>atuk</malay> #ah pek# in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like [oh] no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
like we will just like !huh! like what what are we supposed to do you know [ah] but like <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) I alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
<malay>orang tak suka pakai</malay> mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
#ah pek# together <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tak ada</malay> COVID <malay>gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang</malay> just <malay>biarkan</malay> [jer] [ah]
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do [lah] <malay>dia dah dia dah</malay> like bored [lah] I think
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there <malay>dorang tak tengok pun</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau kalau kau</malay> scan <malay>ke kau tak</malay> scan <malay>ke dorang</malay> just <malay>masuk dia kasi masuk</malay> [jer] <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> [kan] ya so it's like it's so like (uh) jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay [lah] singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not [ah] I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
(um) but because everyone has to wear mask so <malay>tak tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> so it's that's why <malay>tak ada macam</malay> transmission not so much of transmission [ah] ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that [kan] so (err) it's it's like already in our we already know you know like (um) the social way to like <malay>macam</malay> social responsibility [lah] ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause <malay>dah berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> going to one year I feel
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then I'm like also like
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain</malay> is like !wow! <malay>betul-betul rabak</malay> like but <malay>kat</malay> singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> time that time <malay>bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus</malay> [seh] ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
with soap like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa nak cuci tangan dengan</malay> soap I ask you like <malay>tak ada</malay> [seh] all the aunty [ah] wash hand only wash water can already [lah] <malay>dorang memang mesti tak pakai</malay> soap <malay>punya mana ada pakai</malay> soap [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
now now they don't now they're like [ah] ya <malay>kalau</malay> tak wash <malay>nanti</malay> [eh] you never wash you never like use the soap [ah] then <malay>lepas tu baru dorang</malay>
you you really <malay>pakai</malay> the soap ya
(mm)
good things comes of it (uh) come out from it [lah] ya ya ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] like I think it's (um) inevitable [lah] like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
so the toilets are generally cleaner [ah] so like okay [ah] it's not bad [ah] (um) mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown [kan] and know france [kan] <malay>dah</malay> second lockdown
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya rather than <malay>macam kat</malay> sweden where it's like free and easy and then !wow! the death rates are like crazy [seh]
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad <malay>kat</malay> japan [lah] <malay>so dorang kena mula balik</malay> [ah] everything [lah] have to go back the mask and all that (err) I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff [lah] ya I think everywhere is still quite bad [eh] but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden [kan] <malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
<malay>tapi</malay> for me I <malay>kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat</malay> seoul garden <malay>sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kesian</malay> [seh] [ah] <malay>nasib baik dia pergi</malay> doctor
[ah] <malay>naisb baik dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] so
I mean I think <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> he got more hate than
what he should have gotten <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no <malay>dorang</malay> three tables (uh)
so there were still like <malay>macam</malay> #bergroup# <malay>tapi</malay> (err) it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang dorang</malay> mix like you sit here I sit there <malay>ke apa</malay> mix food (err) so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the (um) the fear that they have [lah]
ya so <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya ya
and <malay>dia dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>bila dah kena</malay> COVID and the check up [oh] at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed [lah] the rules and stuff <malay>kat sini</malay> seoul garden [ah] if me I think I wouldn't say so much [seh] I <malay>diam diam</malay> [jer] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already [kan] ya so I feel like (um) he's actually good part [ah] for him to be really responsible also
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended (err) people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
like what the hell does that even mean <malay>gitu</malay> (uh) (uh) so I I was like !wow! this prime minister really wants to like (err) reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
(uh) (uh) I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you <malay>makan</malay> then I'm like but it's so like
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then I'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like I read it I cannot forget [seh] then I keep telling people then people like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so (err) ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang habis</malay> [ah] [a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> it's
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
ya ya ya he's just like [ah] give up [lah] <malay>dah mengaku kalah</malay>
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to <malay>macam</malay> (err) cheer up the community <malay>gitu</malay> (um) it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time [lah]
